Spring is finally peeking out from behind the clouds here in NYC and the mercury is slowly rising across the hemisphere. Welcoming warmer weather means more than just shedding layers—your wardrobe can look forward to a lighter, brighter and slightly less formal break from winter wear. To help make the transition this season, Gilt‘s VP of men’s creative and editorial Tyler Thoreson offers five tips on how to master spring style with goods featured in their Spring Essentials sale. As part of Gilt’s commitment to keep members ahead of the sartorial game, their editorial team works in conjunction with the site’s bevy of emerging designers and exclusive brands—discounted up to 60% on a regular basis—to put it all together.
1. To start the season off right, dress down a spring suit by losing the tie and the socks. Pairing a pocket square with some blue or brown shoes can also add some spark to your look without getting “too matchy-matchy.”
2. If a new suit isn’t in the cards, Thoreson recommends livening up one you already own by changing up what’s underneath. Opt for a button-down in color with a brightly hued, textured tie or start with a patterned shirt and a solid tie to reverse the contrast.
3. As for footwear, says Thoreson, a lightweight suede shoe is the perfect spring essential, and chukkas, drivers or desert boots will anchor your wardrobe for the season.
4. Next up, the scarf. Spring’s lingering chilly evenings require an in-between layer which you can easily pull off in the form of a lightweight wrapper. Whether it’s a solid or subtly printed woven to pair with a suit or a more vibrant linen to go with casual, lighter denim, there are a range of options to keep you looking sharp and staying warm.
5. On the flip side of dressing down your formalwear, injecting some sophistication into your casual look will get you ready for spring. Thoreson recommends slim, trim shorts and shows the outfit with a pair of driving loafers which inject a pop of color in bright orange. The colorful shoes may seem tough to pull off, but Spring is the time to try—it’s not as hard as you may think.

1,"Held at the beautifully historic Grand Palais, the 2013 edition of the Art Paris Art Fair seemed fixated on distorting reference points, by playing with illusions and optical tricks. Among the group of 144 international galleries we encountered work featuring blurred, masked and obstructed faces in generally uncomfortable settings, giving off a disorienting and macabre vibe throughout.
Aurore Valade
Italian gallery Gagliardi Art System presented a body of work illustrating the tendency toward the disturbing. Aurore Valade‘s hyperrealistic family photos, though sharply and neatly presented, depict warped scenes that immediately leave the viewer ill at ease. By playing with age inversions—putting elderly masks on kids and making the old people pose as children—the artist displays disturbing details in perfect still-life scenarios, possibly suggesting a way our old ideas disrupt our progressive and modern mentalities.
J&Peg
Multimedia artistic duo J&Peg‘s photographic series of standing portraits wrap people in everyday outfits—men in formalwear, women coming from the market with bags at hand and basins on their heads—in nylon casings. The form-fitting mask renders it impossible to distinguish the character’s face, and thus their origin as well, sheathing subjects in ambiguity and leaving it up to their accessories to determine their probable condition.
Fabio Viale
The theme of illusion and misdirection continues with Fabio Viale‘s Mona Lisa and skull sculptures. Made to play with optical perception, even the works’ materials play a part in the trick. Seemingly made of dotted styrofoam, each piece is actually carved of pure marble, worked to resemble the lightweight packing material. The switch successfully inverts our common perception of imitation of a poor, ersatz material made to resemble a finer one.
Glaser Kunz
Part of his “Cinematographic Sculptures, Talking Heads,” Glaser Kunz‘s Franziska installation takes its title quite literally with a double video projection of a face split in two. Each side of the automated projection appears, dramatically, to try synchronizing the speaking, but the slight gap between the two parts persists, never letting the left make a smooth image with the right.
Nandan Ghiya
Parisian gallery Paris-Beijing presented the “Family Tree 2.0” series by Indian artist Nandan Ghiya. Consisting of collages of vintage, colonial-era portraits in altered frames, the individual works feature faces obscured by a black stripe or blurred by pixelation. They form imaginary trees of life—false ancestral lines if you will. Not only has time lost track of these nameless people, their achievements in life, personal destinies and stories, but the artist has erased their faces and mixed them in with strange communities as well. The recycling of subjects and reconstituting relationships could be seen as somewhat of a parody of the arborescence of social networks.
Leland Bobbé
The Empty Quarter, Dubai’s only fine art photography gallery, presented a series of deeply intriguing portraits by American Leland Bobbé. “Half Drags” captures the contrasting faces of men who often dress in drag. On one side they sport their natural look, on the other their made-up face and elaborate wigs—uniting their male and female identities into one.
Al-Mutasim Al-Maskery
The Empty Quarter also gave us the rare occasion to see the work of Omani artist Al-Mutasim Al-Maskery, who works with gender identity as well. His series of portraits of young Omani women wearing keffiyeh turbans is unsettling in its ambiguity. The delicate, head-on lighting and traditional headwear create the illusion of androgyny and confuse the viewer as to whether the subject is boy or girl.
Tor Seidel
German artist Tor Seidel‘s non-portraits hide the subject almost entirely. By shrouding the body in darkness, allowing only a pair of legs to emerge out of the black, the artists aims to show human emotions without the obvious use of facial expressions.
Igor Skaletsky
Rounding out the portrait-driven arts are the disturbing oil paintings by the young Russian artist Igor Skaletsky, presented by France’s Alfa Galerie. The full portrait paintings in the “Deviations” series feature erased or hidden faces, with a subversive strength drawing on the use of the purest Flemish Golden Age painting style and composition. Contrasting against the paintings’ perfectly executed era specific style, Skaletsky incorporates Mickey Mouse ears or even reveals the tattooed legs of a noble Flemish clergy members to bring new meaning to the otherwise archaic paintings.

1. American Fashion is Commercial
At the Lincoln Center tents, one cannot help but feel a strong trade show vibe as sponsors flit about, offering gifts from cosmetics to alcohol. Although there are complaints about the commercialism behind the overtaken floors, these companies are in fact underwriting the excessive cost of fashion shows, argues New York magazine’s Robin Givhan. The subtext to each complaint is that corporate sponsors make the New York collections more banal by some kind of mass-market osmosis. But American fashion has always had broad mass-market appeal, allowing it to grow in a way that French fashion hasn’t. Most people are not interested in complicated apparel, and the American consumer searches for wardrobe selections across multiple price points. That market need doesn’t make American fashion any less creative. From J. Crew to Proenza Schouler, the American aesthetic mingles with market appeal.
2. Google Glass Fashion Week
This New York Fashion Week, Google Glass took their newly launched Instagram account to the streets. From Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center to MADE Fashion Week at Milk Studios, Glass snagged sartorial photos of attendees. The one through line to every photo—from high fashion to street style—all subjects were wearing Glass. Diane von Furstenberg was the first to incorporate the technology into her Spring/Summer 2013 show last fall, and it seems to have certainly taken off from there.
3. 10 Types of People You Meet at Fashion Week Parties
For many New Yorkers, Fashion Week is as much about the opulent parties as it is the cutting edge design. While the endless flow of bubbly and canapés are enough for some, the real joy is simply observing your fellow partygoers. This slightly sarcastic yet startlingly accurate list of the 10 types of people you meet at fashion parties does the party-going and people-watching for you. From the obvious list-toppers like “Models who only hang with other models” to the headier “Just one glass of champagne fashion mom,” illustrator Peter Arckle and NY Mag editor Kurt Soller prove they have earned their stripes (are stripes in?) in the fashion party scene. While high fashion is a true art form, there’s nothing wrong with having a laugh at the scene surrounding it.
4. threeASFOUR on the Jewish Museum Runway
Gabriel Asfour, Adi Gil and Angela Donhauser, the designers that make up threeASFOUR, explored classic religious iconography for a show and exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York City. Together—in line with the goals of the MER KA BA exhibit—the designers used geometric patterns found within imagery from the three major monotheistic religions to create a stunning line of black and white gowns. Comprised of a mix of classic silhouettes and avant-garde patterns and expressions, the show paid homage to its history with a wave of contemporary courage. All the photos are available at Paper Mag.
5. Rescue Meets Runway
Founded in 2008, modern sportswear apparel brand Unruly Heir is known for creating rebellious twists on new classics—all produced and handmade in New York. True to their nonconformist perspective and appreciation for the city, the two designers Joey Goodwin and John Gagliano had a few surprises in store for their S/S 2014 show in TriBeCa this past Tuesday. The brand collected suggested donations at the door to benefit the New York City Rescue Mission, but also upped their support for the oldest non-profit in the country by featuring David—one of the men in their recovery program—as one of the models. This collaboration brought the issue of homelessness into the spotlight, declaring a resounding and significant social message in the midst of hectic Fashion Week.
6. Is Wearable Technology Actually Fashionable?
The Cut’s series of candid Q&As with notable figures in the fashion industry asked for opinions on wearable technology. After a slew of tech specs and reviews, it’s refreshing to get a fashion perspective on the style aesthetics of Google Glass and Samsung’s new smartwatch. The overall theme seemed to be one of hesitance, but the best blunt reaction of Google Glass came from Deborah Needleman, editor-in-chief at T Magazine, who said: “It’s like the worst kind of German architect nerd glasses.” Runner-up: Paper magazine’s Mickey Boardman made a particularly interesting point on how quickly fashion moves: “They’re not even out, but they’re already old.”
7. Best in Menswear
It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the precipitous volume of fashion coverage over the course of the event-laden week. Luckily for menswear fans, our friends at Four Pins sifted through the streetwear-inspired athletic formalwear, the athletic-inspired formal streetwear and everything between. Known for their deft blend of snark with genuine love and respect for fashion design, the crew at Four Pins opted for mostly subdued yet mega-high quality pieces that appear to be truly wearable for us mere fashion mortals. Don’t miss out on the captions for Four Pins’ signature brand of humor that both pokes fun at fashion and aptly pays homage to the near-obsession that keeps us coming back to the crowded shows each year.
8. Fashion Insane Asylum
In typical Thom Browne fashion, his Chelsea show this NYFW totally blew our minds. His emotionally inspired collection and above-and-beyond showmanship made for a cinema-worthy event. With headless plaster bodies hanging from the ceiling and models passing out meds (which were actually white M&Ms), the models hit the runway with smeared red lipstick and frizzy grey hair. As for the dresses, the white palette and careful cuts and folds appeared to be surgically produced. The craftsmanship was the finest you’ll see coming out of NYFW. Check out all the garments and mental patient-inspired makeup via V Magazine.
This week’s Link About It—our filtered look at the web, published weekly every Saturday morning—was in celebration of New York Fashion Week and sponsored by Motorola. Read all of the articles from this week’s report in our handy Nextly stream.

3,"As those of us in the northern hemisphere offload shorts and T-shirts into storage, it’s time to start looking for tailored jackets to brace the changing weather. J. Hilburn—a leader in made-to-measure menswear—has introduced a slew of fall fabrics to fit the bill. After testing out their shirting service, we were confident in the company’s ability to deliver a top-shelf product at affordable pricing. As a follow-up, we met with Jon Patrick, the company’s creative director, to preview their autumnal swatches and ask them to put together a tailored two-button suit out of hunter green corduroy.
J. Hilburn is able to deliver their tailored creations at reasonable prices by leveraging direct-to-factory relationships. The fabrics come from Guabello and Vitale Barberis, a pair of mills located in Northern Italy. The partial lining of the jackets lends a relaxed look and fit, and attention to detail is visible on the finished edges of the seams. With construction and materials taken care of, the company then lets consumers call the rest of the shots on options like button, lining, pocket and vent styles, with the help of an appointed advisor.
Aside from the new fall offerings, J. Hilburn also recently launched a formalwear collection that delivers tuxedoes for a black-tie dress code. Made to fit your specifications, the suits beat out just about any off-the-rack option. The company is also gearing up to release a line of grooming products with a shave cream and after-shave balm.

4,"Without the demanding structure of an in-person New York Fashion Week schedule, designers were free to debut digital shows, consider events in locations outside NYC or opt out in favor of different, independent presentations. Plenty of big name labels did just that—with several noticeably absent. That left room for emerging and mid-level designers to show some riskier, off-kilter, playful productions. This fashion week, we found ourselves drawn to the vibrant collections that encourage joy, nostalgia and a little joy. Here are our highlights from the virtual New York FW21 presentations.
Christian Cowan
Designer Christian Cowan‘s three-and-a-half minute narrative fashion film was as eclectic as it was celebratory. Starring Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman, directed by Matthew Frost and titled A Fashion Thing, the comedic virtual spectacle in NYC’s Pierre Hotel incorporated bright, bold, shimmering and empowered pieces for all genders—united by optimistic extravagance. Further, proceeds from Cowan’s collection will benefit the Loveland Foundation, which supports the young Black queer community in Atlanta.
KkCo
“After 12 months of being cut off from the real world—we’ve created our own,” designer Kara Jubin explains in a statement preceding her label KkCo’s NYFW presentation. Surreal yet stylish, the collection comprises colors, clashing prints, clever silhouettes, and, on multiple occasions, cyclopic models, adding even more magic to the otherworldly offering. It’s a playful collection with serious design prowess.
CHOCHENG
Employing all-natural and 100% cruelty-free materials exclusively, CHOCHENG designer Cho Cho Cheng marries many influences for his NYFW FW21 presentation. A Parsons fashion and costume design alum and an expert at British tailoring, Cheng applies these talents to womenswear and, more specifically, women’s tailoring. Eye-catching coats come with contrasting collars; extravagant caps flow into webbed capes; formalwear is reinvigorated with the right amount of theatric flair. According to Cheng, it’s Mulan reimagined in a 1980s utopia.
KA WA KEY
London-based label KA WA KEY‘s gender-inclusive collection comprises several colorful knitwear garments, cut-and-sew blazers and beanies, and plenty of patterns. The wool-dominated FW21 presentation references the eccentricity of characters like Willy Wonka and the Mad Hatter, translating their odd personas into layered wool ensembles and boucle tops and bottoms.
KEENKEE
Matching sets make up most of the FW21 collection from designer Kee Kim’s menswear label, KEENKEE, from which there are plenty of statement pieces. Ombre coats pair with shiny pants, and all-over floral prints juxtapose tie-dyed velvet pants. Altogether the collection proves far-reaching. There are pieces within that cater to plenty of styles, especially if you’re someone seeking garments in optimistic tones.
Casablanca
From Charaf Tajer’s Casablanca, the “Grand Prix” collection encapsulates all the glitz and glam of Monaco, with plenty of casino references. Quilted coats contrast silky blouses, but all thematically link up through delightfully gaudy prints and almost-kitsch silhouettes.
Timo Weiland
Through images snapped by Timo Weiland co-founder Alan Eckstein, the NYC-based brand introduced their latest menswear articles in style. The lookbook, which features creative direction by Donna Kang and styling by Haley Loewenthal, puts “polished leisure” front and center, pairing the brand’s dress shirts and sport jackets with jeans. The single-breasted pink and double-breasted red blazers stand out for the fact that they bring levity to the future of formal.
Prabal Gurung
An ode to NYC, Prabal Gurung‘s FW21 collection embraces exaggerated shapes, sumptuous textures and glorious hues. Gurung says the garments are inspired by the city and “its eclectic misfits and impossible dreamers.” With some ’60s and ’70s influences, plenty of volume and clashing colors, the overarching vibe is one of playful glamour.
