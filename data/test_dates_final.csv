"Oct 10, 2022","The Hyères International Festival of Fashion, Photography and Accessories is attracting the crowds more than ever. Partners, houses and institutions are jostling to be there. The festival has an extensive program lined up and a string of sponsors that have come together for this 37th edition, which will be held from October 13 to 16 in the famous Villa Noailles, on the heights of Hyères. 
A total of 30 finalists have been selected. They will be awarded on Sunday, October 16 by three separate juries in the fashion, photography and accessories categories, chaired respectively by Y/Project and Diesel's creative director Glenn Martens, Belgian visual artist Pierre Debusschere and Aska Yamashita, creative director of Atelier Montex, an embroidery house belonging to Chanel's crafts group.
 
The festival was founded in 1986 by it's director Jean-Pierre Blanc and is chaired by Pascale Mussard. The competition is considered the oldest competition in the world for young designers and has continued to grow in popularity. After two years of pandemic, it is back with a vengeance, supported by new partners and its original patrons. Chanel will be a major partner, financing three awards. The first being the ""19M des métiers d'art"" prize for the fashion category with a grant of 20,000 euros. Secondly another 20,000 euros for the photography grand prize and finally the accessories prize, including a collaborative project with Chanel's crafts group and 20,000 euros.Also for accessories, since 2020 Hermès has been present through a specific prize focused on the creation of a particular accessory, this year, the belt, with a grant of 20,000 euros. Other major luxury groups have also supported the festival for several years, such as LVMH and Kering. The latter is organizing a workshop on sustainable development with the finalists of the festival.  
This year, for the first time, one of its houses, Bottega Veneta, is participating in the event, offering a grant to the photography contest winner, who will win the chance to participate in one of the brand's campaigns. Bottega Veneta's creative director Matthieu Blazy will therefore be part of the jury. The competition will also be supported for the first time by the creative and technical production companies Sheriff Projects and Kitten, while American Vintage will present its own prize, launched six years ago, with a value of 15,000 euros.
 
Another new feature is the participation of ""Atelier des Matières"", created by Chanel in 2019 in Le Meux in the Oise region, to recycle unused materials and unsold finished products from the fashion and luxury sectors. This entity is launching its own prize in the fashion category, rewarding one of the ten finalists for making their design from only the materials made available to them by Atelier des Matières. The winner will receive a selection of fabrics and leathers worth 10,000 euros. This ecological prize is in addition to the 20,000 euro for the eco-friendly collection prize promoted by Mercedes-Benz since 2021.
 
The European Flax and Hemp Confederation is also joining the Festival for the first time as an official partner of the Première Vision Jury Grand Prize. As well as the Chinese brand Icicle, owned by the ICCF group, which also owns Carven, and Instagram. Icicle will offer mentoring to the winners, enabling them to understand and make the best use of the various features of the social network and Meta applications.
 
Also on the Festival program are exhibitions, concerts, film screenings, creative workshops, as well as the ""Rencontres internationales de la mode"" (International Fashion Meetings), which have been organized for the past 21 years by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, which this year is organizing three round tables on the themes of innovation and Metaverse with many speakers, including Gregory Boutté, head of digital at Kering; Launchmetrics CEO Michael Jais; Givenchy's legal director Isabelle Franchet; and the Metaverse Fashion Week director Giovanna Graziosi Casimiro.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 10, 2022","Jennifer Zuccarini, the former designer for Victoria Secret, founder of the first brand Kiki de Montparnasse in 2006 in New York, launched the lingerie brand Fleur du Mal 10 years ago. She celebrated her anniversary during the LA Fashion Week, organized from October 6 to 9.  
Guest of a first debate on the ""Business of pleasure"", the designer returned to her career and the development of Fleur du Mal, ""a brand originally thought for women,"" Zuccarini says, ""and to explore their sexuality in a beautiful way"", starting with a launch of collections for women, a mix of elegant lingerie, sometimes embroidered and sophisticated, supplemented by a line of loungewear dresses, a selection of bodysuits and sexy and latex sets called ""Pleasure"".
 
A universe that the designer expanded two years ago with the release of new collection segments celebrating sex-positivity, as well as a first line of men's lingerie inviting silk and even lace on boxer shorts models. ""Fleur du Mal is an inclusive brand, we celebrate all genders and sexualities,"" continues Zuccarini, ""and for our tenth anniversary we are presenting our first exclusive line dedicated to trans women"". Collections that the designer presented a few hours later to Sunset at EDITION, the club of the West Hollywood EDITION Hotel. A memorable evening where the guests plunged into a red and blue light atmosphere, and discovered the lascivious Fleur du Mal models, all wearing the latest collection accompanied by music inviting you to shake.
 
After opening a first boutique in New York in 2017 and a second in Los Angeles in 2021, both of which feature the entire Fleur du Mal universe, the designer is expected to strengthen her ""Pleasure"" category in the coming months and invite new lifestyle items including perfumes and candles. ""We also recently launched a line dedicated to women who have had a masectomy,"" says Zuccarini. When we analyzed the market, we realized that there was no brand that offered pretty lingerie dedicated to this category of women and with which they could feel beautiful, so we imagined it.""The designer, supported since 2018 by the entrepreneur and investor Andrew Rosen, notably at the origin of the brand Theory, and having already invested with the brands Rag & Bone and Alice + Olivia, also announces to accelerate its retail development with these next years with the opening of 7 new stores.
 
In addition to Florida for the U.S. market, Jennifer Zuccarini also hopes to soon expand internationally. ""London and Paris are cities that interest us, as well as the South American market with Mexico City,"" Zuccarini continues. ""As we have done each time, we will start with pop-ups to test each market.""

"Oct 7, 2022","Guests invited to the presentation of Nanushka's Spring/Summer 2023 collection were greeted by a palette of pastel colors combining different textures and highlighting traditional craft techniques. The event took place during Paris Fashion Week, in a bright space located at number 51 rue de Monceau, where the Hungarian brand chose to present its latest collection in a showroom format, after having organised a runway show at the Palais Garnier in March. ""The main idea of this collection was to find beauty in imperfection,"" explained Sandra Sandor to FashionNetwork.com. The creative director and founder of Nanushka said that this philosophy ""has always been at the heart of the brand, but we are further emphasizing it this season."" The collection, which at first glance has little imperfections, featured flowy and suggestive juxtapositions in warm and neutral tones as well as reinterpretations of the brand's signature garments such as long knit tops or dresses, oversized shirts, wide and structured blazers, fitted skirts and satin pants. 

A contemporary touch was brought by bohemian embroidery and revisited logos: a discreet lowercase ""n"" adorned turtleneck T-shirts and denim ensembles with tone-on-tone prints, in both the women's and men's lines. ""The brand's menswear is in a way the little brother of the Nanushka woman. The design teams work very closely together,"" said the London College of Fashion graduate regarding the aesthetic coherence between the two lines. Initially known as a womenswear brand, Nanushka also offers unisex pieces as part of its men's and women's collections.Attention to detail was seen not only in the designs, but also in the construction of the garments. ""We really wanted to emphasize the human touch. A lot of the pieces were made by hand using traditional techniques. I wanted to pay homage to the artisanal methods of our craftsmen and for the garments to exude that personal touch and the emotions that are poured into them when they are made,"" said Sandor, proud of her in-house design team stationed at the company's headquarters in Budapest, an atelier employing around 20 people.Hand embroidered pieces, braided tops, draped distorted prints and unique handbags make up the collection, woven using a crochet technique used in rug making. The brand emphasized ""intuitive and organic design"". ""Our goal is to create a new heritage based on the idea of combining traditional Hungarian techniques while developing new innovations,"" added Sandor. This is embodied in one of the brand's most iconic bags: an oversized origami-style accessory that has been reinterpreted as a patchwork in soft pastel tones, made using deadstock fabrics.

""It's a very practical design that combines our values of innovation, craftsmanship and functionality,"" said the designer. The accessories category, which includes footwear, hats, small leather goods, eyewear and jewelry, is also seeing an increase in sales, ""Especially bags!"", said Sandor, excited about the category's potential.  In search of the perfect materialAn innovative alternative material to leather dubbed Oktobor, which means 'eco-leather' in Hungarian, was the highlight of the collection. Nanushka's innovation department has been working on the fabric for the past four years together with key players in its supply chain. The result? Lightweight and supple garments visually resembling leather, rendered in pastel colors such as light yellow, sky blue and lilac purple. The material, made of 56% recycled polyester from PET plastic bottles and 44% polyurethane, requires 80% less water to manufacture than other wet processing methods. ""Our vegan leather performed very well in the market, but this version is even better. It has taken us a very long time to get the exact effect we were looking for. Our goal was to find a new alternative to leather, produced in a more sustainable way, with a luxurious texture and a better quality surface,"" said Sandor of her new trademark. ""The beauty of the material is tremendously important. We don't want to produce sustainable pieces that are not beautiful and pleasant to the touch,"" she continued.

Founded in 2006, the Budapest-based brand is one of the first premium brands to adopt a sustainable approach with vegan leather pieces. Part of the Vanguards Group's brand portfolio, which also includes brands such as Aeron and Sunnei, Nanushka operates three stores of its own in Budapest, London and New York. The label is also distributed in 140 physical points-of-sale and in multiple luxury e-commerce platforms, such as Farfetch, Browns and MyTheresa. The company, which already employs about 100 people, expects to close the current fiscal year with a turnover of 50 million euros.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 7, 2022","Appointment was taken at the Lighthouse ArtSpace in Hollywood, an entertainment multiplex used for digital art projections (Van Gogh among them), for the new edition of Los Angeles Fashion Week, supported by the CFDA.  Maxwell Osborne's brand was announced as the inaugural show. The New York designer revealed in 2008 with his brand Public School and now at the head of his new label AnOnlyChild, attracted from 7pm a large audience of 300 people.

The public had to wait for the official opening of the doors scheduled an hour later, while VIPs, media and celebrities were welcomed with tons of hugs. On the photo call, the rapper Tyga, the star of Black Panther Michael B. Jordan, or actor Jesse Williams, were photographed from all angles, all invited to cross a first room with walls adorned with giant screens broadcasting AnOnlyChild's color palette, then to join a second space, a large lounge adorned with mirror columns, baroque sofas and covered with Persian rugs.8:30 PM. After a few big flashes on Tyga, the AnOnlyChild show could start. It's getting late, the expression perfectly found to baptize the second chapter of the collection, after the first one in New-York at the end of September, presented with an attractive tag-line: ""a mash up of movement, music and most important, love"".

Walking on the excellent title Shots of the rapper Trust and the Back to Life of Soul II Soul, the models revealed a colorful, gentle and sometimes sophisticated wardrobe, always inspired by the Jamaican roots of Maxwell Osborne. On the menu: flowing blouses, voluminous dresses, shirts with wide V-necks, pleated pants, always matched with a scarf, always daring the color, such as a powerful and beautiful purple. Everywhere silk, from deadstocks or recycled, is invited on the collar of a suit, a jacket with large epaulets or adorns long draped evening dresses.The marriage of lace and a pleated satin dress scored points, and the masculine silhouettes convinced as well as the combination of mesh shirt, lace top and satin pants, the series of evening suits in lamé velvet and sport jackets, or the total recycled denim look.

One last lap, the music of DJ Nicolas Jaar ideal to conclude, the greeting of Maxwell Osborne, and here is the Fashion Week of LA well launched. Guests joined an after party at West Hollywood Edition hotel that was going to last.

"Oct 6, 2022","Professor Jimmy Choo’s JCA/London Fashion Academy is to host its rescheduled debut London Fashion Week show on 10 October, alongside its designer-in-residence, Patrick McDowell.The original 19 September show was postponed and will now take place across three storeys of the JCA’s Mayfair Building, commencing at 6.30pm on the Monday. 

The show was, like many others, affected by the death of the Queen with the funeral happening in the middle of London Fashion Week. It meant a scramble to reschedule shows, some of them taking place on other days during the fashion week and others being delayed by a week or more after the event.Showing first on 10 October, British designer Patrick McDowell will unveil his SS23 collection, ‘Marie Antoinette goes to Liverpool’.The show will be followed by each MA Student presenting their debut collections in the same space. 

Stephen Smith, founder and CEO of the JCA said: “Our upcoming London Fashion Week show is a momentous occasion for us all at the JCA. Since officially opening our doors only one year ago… we have nurtured our first graduating MA cohort from our home on Hanover Square. Opening our doors to the public one year on is the perfect moment to celebrate not only the successes of these hugely talented young designers but to also give our Designer in Residence and Sustainability Ambassador Patrick McDowell a stage within the building that inspired his ‘Marie Antoinette goes to Liverpool’ collection.’’ 

Smith added: “At the Academy we professionally incubate our learners as emerging designers. This means that our students will begin their professional lives from the moment they enter the Academy, developing their craft by establishing their own brand label, working in professional studios and through exhibiting, showcasing and trading in a luxury Mayfair location. Showcasing at London Fashion Week, and alongside established designers, is a natural extension of that approach.”

"Oct 6, 2022","Scheduled to open Los Angeles Fashion Week, the label created by Maxwell Osborne will present part two of its latest collection this Thursday night at Lighthouse Artspace. It follows the presentation of part one of the collection in New York at the end of September.

Before the LA show, FashionNetwork.com spoke with the designer. FashionNetwork.com: AnOnlyChild is inspired by your Jamaican roots. What connection do you have with this country; have you lived there? How did it inspire you in the creation of your brand?

Maxwell Osborne: My family is Jamaican and although I did not live there, I spent summers there when I was younger. A lot of it is not based on the look of the past but the idea of the playful joy they had when they had nothing. Entertaining themselves with whatever they can get their hands on.FNW: AnOnlyChild was born during the COVID pandemic. Was this crisis context an easy time to be creative?

MO: Inspiration was lacking at that time being that I'm most inspired by traveling. During the pandemic, I was able to reflect about life and what was happening in the world and look inward. Making something from nothing out of nothing as AnOnlyChild.  

FNW: You will present the second chapter of your first collection at LAFW; what convinced you to accept to show in Los Angeles? 

MO: I’ve always been drawn to the rawness of LAFW. We’re frequently flying in between NYC and LA to source deadstock material, so there was already a connection but overall it felt natural and the right time to present. And so it makes sense to show our first collection on both sides, hence part two, the B-sides. FNW: Why did you choose the name ""AnOnlyChild,"" what does it refer to?

MO: The brand name comes from my childhood of being an only child. Growing up, I had to make something out of nothing, such as entertaining myself and being preoccupied, which is the reason AnOnlyChild was started during a time of uncertainty. Making new textiles as all the mills and factories were closed. 

FNW: Can you give us a preview of what people will see at the show, tonight? 

MO: The New York show was called “It’s Getting Late'' and the Los Angeles show is called “It’s Getting Late, The B-Sides.” Like a record player, you have to flip it to the B-side to listen to the remaining tracks of the album. The collection is a continuation of what we showed at NYFW but a remix that still consists of silk dresses, tailored separates, strong suitings. However, there is “freshness” with new silhouettes and colorways for the West Coast. 

FNW: Is the choice to introduce more colors in parallel with a certain evolution of your mindset?

MO: Being that we work with deadstock fabrics the colors come to us… We create from what we find. 

FNW: How is the brand already distributed, and which markets are you targeting for sales? 

MO: When we launched, the collection was available through our e-commerce and in-stores exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue New York. We are expanding doors this season, yet we approach sales as a collaborative effort with our retail partners.

"Oct 6, 2022","In 2021 the festival was held in December, but this year it will be held in Dinan from Friday, October 7 to Sunday, October 9, The change in dates is a one-off, as it will return to its usual spring dates in 2023: April 21, 22 and 23.Chaired and founded by Dominique Damien Réhel, the event aims to reveal young talents who have just graduated from fashion school or already created their own brand.

"Oct 6, 2022","One luxury label cutting some clever moves, in both fashion and elsewhere, is the Ritz, which unveiled its second collection with hipster fashion label Frame during Paris Fashion Week. Part of a brand building project that sees the Ritz Paris open its first own boutique in Doha today. 
Frame X Ritz Paris debuted last October, and its first ideas immediately found favor with style conscious consumers. The new collection goes a stage further, adding a full family array of choice to around 20 items. Everything from pajamas and varsity jackets to funky patchwork logo jeans and a dog’s blanket.
 
Though its core is luxury staples - crewneck cashmere cable knit sweaters and thick pile cotton sweatshirts. All featuring various versions of the storied inn’s logo, and very much priced at the upper range of the market. Sweatshirts sell for €360 and cropped cashmere pullovers for €630.The Ritz remains a remarkable magnate for mega stars and VIPs. During the recent season, the likes of Bradley Cooper, Kanye West, Gwyneth Paltrow and Josse of BlackPink all rested their weary limbs at the grand hotel.
 
Frame X Ritz Paris now retails in Frame’s growing chain of stores - 15 alone in the UK and US, including three in Manhattan – and in powerhouse e-tailers like Net-a-Porter, Moda Operandi, Luisa Via Roma, and Frame Tmall Flagship. In the world of bricks and mortar wholesale it’s available in the likes of Harrods, Printemps, Le Bon Marché, Holt Renfrew in Canada and NK in Sweden.
 
During this month’s New York Fashion Week, the label also opened a large pop-up inside Bergdorf Goodman, finished with classy Director doors, echoing the hotel’s architecture. Backed up by a cool ad campaign shot by Alasdair McLellan, the brand seems to have significant global momentum.
 
So, we sat down with Natalie Barder, The Ritz board member in charge of brand strategy for the hotel marque. The hotel belongs to the Al Fayed family who bought it directly from the Ritz family in 1979, and the family often comes and stays. Daughter Camilla, who has a much-acclaimed vegan restaurant called Farmacy in London, came up with the idea of a Frame partnership.
 
Fashion Network: How do you find Frame?
Natalie Bader: I’d say it was opportunistic. We thought it would be great to have a partner like Frame that would bring a new vision of the Ritz, young, fresh and friendly. I liked the idea of mixing that with our great tradition. Camilla introduced me to the Frame team, and I met Erik Torstensson (Frame founder) and fit was immediate.
 
FN: Why did you not work with a bigger luxury brand?
NB: No, our job is to find new talent. For instance, we have taken François Perret, a great young pastry maker. And we will do the same with our new chef, a girl called Eugénie Béziat. She is still fresh, young and we will develop her here. Eugénie is from the south of France and born in Africa, so she has a sense of taste and fragrance that is special.
 
In June, Perret opened Ritz Paris Le Comptoir at 38 rue Cambon, allowing passersby to taste his signature whipped cream desserts like Barquette Caramel or Entremets Madelaine inside a bright white space lit by a giant Bohemian blown glass ceiling fitting.  
 
The Ritz’s grandest restaurant l’Espadon, closed during the Covid Pandemic, and will open next September with Béziat in charge of the kitchen. At her restaurant La Flibuste in the Alpes-Maritimes, the 38-year-old Béziat was noted for her audacious recipes such as red mullet, helicryse, carrot tops and artichoke with cocoa. Currently, the Ritz’s main restaurant is the Brassiere Vendome, near its front door on the square of the same name.
 
FN: What was you brief with Frame?
NB: The brief was to keep the spirit of grand classic, but with a twist of their modernity and expertise in producing clothes. This is why there is cashmere and expensive fabrics. And to find a creative twist from hospitality, like on the back of the sweatshirt where it reads, Junior Suite. Keeping the color codes of the Ritz - navy blue, white and our burgundy, which is in our Vendome restaurant.
 
FN: What was your retail plan for the collab’?
NB: First, the collection sold in Frame boutiques and partners, and in our little concept store here in the Ritz. Plus, they have a distribution network we appreciated. Now, with this second collection we have been very nicely exposed in Frame boutiques. I was in New York for its fashion week, and we had big windows in Frames three stores, on Madison, in Soho and in the Meatpacking District, and in their big corner in Bergdorf Goodman.

FN: What is the business arrangement?
NB: It is a license, and they pay us a percentage of sales. Which is great and we love it. They listen to us, and we discuss our ideas. And they absolutely respect our concept.
 
FN: Revenues and sales?
NB: I cannot tell you, but I think it has been very good for Frame. But, sales wise we are talking about several tens of millions in revenue.
 
FN: From a brand building point of view, what is your next move?
NB: We are now developing with the Ritz different activities out of this building. We will open the first ever Ritz boutique in Doha, in Galeries Lafayette on October 6. It will sell the full universe of The Ritz – tableware, robes, linen, fragrance, candles and teddy bears! Our new line of candles in porcelain will retail for 280 euros, with Haviland from Limoges, with whom they have worked since 1898, the year the hotel opened.
 
FN: Would you ever build another Ritz?
NB: Yes, we are working on it right now. We are looking at possible locations. Not in America, as there is the Ritz Carlton. Maybe in Asia, maybe in Tokyo. We don’t know yet but we are working on it. Voila!
 
FN: What is the annual turnover of the Ritz?
NB: What do you think?
 
FN: Depends on how many rooms you have?
NB: We have 140 rooms, but they are not all rooms, but many suites and half suites. And, we have the restaurant and the salons to rent.
 
FN: So, about 300 million euros?
NB: About.
 
FN: Is any hotel as good as the Ritz?
NB: No, we are an icon. And in terms of performance, we are the best. In terms of per key rate, we are the very best.

"Oct 6, 2022","Inditex and IndustriALL have strengthened their commitment to improve working conditions in the textile supply chain with the signing of a new protocol on the 15th anniversary of the signing of their global framework agreement, as reported by the company in a statement.The new agreement was signed on Tuesday by the CEO of Inditex, Oscar García Maceiras, and the general secretary of IndustriALL global union, Atle Hoie.

By strengthening the Global Union Committee and its coordinating bodies, the new protocol furthers social dialogue through the establishment of new mechanisms that reinforce the role of local unions and move towards a better understanding of the needs of workers in the Inditex Group's supply chain.With this new protocol, Inditex and IndustriALL will formulate a joint work plan that will focus on continued respect for the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the provision of training to workers' representatives, the textile group's suppliers and factory workers in its supply chain.

The two entities are also making progress on a new workplace access protocol, which aims to deepen the knowledge and monitoring of working conditions in the factories in Inditex's supply chain.

""The protocol signed today, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the framework agreement between Inditex and IndustriALL, evidences our determination to strengthen respect for fundamental labor rights across our supply chain and marks a fresh milestone in both IndustriALL and Inditex's ongoing mission of improving the lives of the women and men who populate it,"" said Garcia Maceiras.

Meanwhile, Hoie stressed that this agreement ""was a breakthrough that has since lead the way for more responsible sourcing and proper industrial relations in the sector."" ""The fact that we agree with Inditex to increase the role of our local and national unions and to firmly defend their right to organize and bargain collectively in supply chains gives hope to many,"" he added.

The Director of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Spain, Félix Peinado, who was present at the signing ceremony, expressed his satisfaction with the agreement. ""Spanish trade unions Comisiones Obreras and UGT, together with Inditex, have been frontrunners in Spain with this agreement. I could not be prouder of this agreement or happier to celebrate its anniversary. The agreement is an example of how, with the combined commitment and hard work of companies and their workers' representatives, it is possible to forge better working conditions around the world,"" he said.

This agreement marks a new milestone in the ongoing partnership between Inditex and IndustriALL, which began 15 years ago, in 2007, with the signing of the Global Framework Agreement, which represented a significant breakthrough for the industry, as well as a major boost to its sustainability and a real opportunity to improve the working conditions of the almost millions of people who work in the factories manufacturing for Inditex worldwide.

"Oct 5, 2022","The marathon of women's ready-to-wear shows for spring-summer 2023 ended on Tuesday with many surprises. The designers once again gave their vision of the tragic times the world is going through, with true manifesto collections. From Miu Miu's call for simplicity to Xuly.Bët's ecological alert, via Ungaro's quest for positivity.
  
Miu Miu condenses in one collection the new ideal wardrobe, both easy and special, sporty and chic. Miuccia Prada starts with her most classic pieces - the jacket, the coat, the shirt, the pleated skirt and the knitwear - which she mixes and revisits with subtlety. The result is a very Prada Miu Miu collection. A collection that also seems to be strongly linked to the Milanese label's flagship line, presented last week in Milan in a spirit of new austerity.
 
Thus, the mini silhouette is constructed as simply as possible from a layering of white and grey T-shirts over ultra-fine beige or light grey knitwear. The men's jacket is slipped over a bra and, optionally, a pleated or wrap skirt in grey flannel and black wool.
 
This summer's dressing room cannot miss the house's emblematic nylon, which plays the starring role, in white shirts, skirts and little dresses with zips at the front or back, or in dresses with straps gathered at the neckline. This ultra-light fabric is also used, of course, as a windbreaker in collared shirts or in a khaki version worn inside out for a blouse effect.

Leather is used in this urban wardrobe, at first in small details, in overskirts with large patch pockets, a bit like a fanny pack. Good old worn leather, which the designer also uses to cut large sleeveless coats, waistcoats or jackets, all of which also have maxi pockets. Smooth, lighter leather is used to make shirts, skirts, trousers and shorts in different colours. In another variation, the same pieces are cut from faded denim to give them the same leather wear.In the evening, the Miu Miu girl has fun with transparencies. A simple layer of impalpable fabric is all that is needed to compose a top and a skirt, placed directly on the body, which is sometimes illuminated with stones and crystals.

 A change of scenery with Xuly.Bët, who closed fashion week on Tuesday evening with a memorable and energetic public show in the heart of Paris, just behind the town hall. An environmentalist before his time, the designer Lamine Badian Kouyaté, originally from Mali, chose the Place Baudoyer, where the Climate Academy is located, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his brand. The idea was for the runway to be in the building, but this was refused. He had nevertheless been granted permission to hold his show in the square, but was turned away at the last minute.
 
He therefore retreated to the neighbouring François Miron street, bringing with him a large and friendly audience. As the sound system was also forbidden, the models went out without music, accompanied only by a small speaker in their hands, encouraged by the ""ouh ouh"" and applause of the public.
 
Perched on transparent high-heeled sandals with gaiters and split skirts, or in shimmering dresses and tops and white Catwoman suits, they made their way down the catwalk to the cheers of the audience.

""Magnificent!""

""Beautiful!""

""Bravo!"" from the fans. Some of the girls responded by improvising a dance step in front of a few bewildered passers-by, while buses and taxis continued to pass by in the street.
 
A joyful atmosphere, from which the name of the brand seems to have taken all its meaning. Xuly.Bët means ""open your eyes"" in Wolof. ""For 30 years, we have been alerting everyone to the damage our profession is doing to the planet. Today, the world is burning, but nothing is happening. We have to shout,"" said Kouyaté backstage at the fashion show. Self-taught, he switched to fashion after studying architecture, and from the outset the designer seduced people with his approach, recycling clothes salvaged from second-hand stores to make unique pieces. Transferred to New York in 2015, he made his big return to the Parisian catwalks in 2020.

 Make way for lightness and colour at Ungaro. ""With fashion, we have the power to make people smile and bring them joy. I wanted to inject a little beauty into a world that is not really beautiful at the moment,"" says creative director Kobi Halperin, who was inspired by Gauguin's trip to Haiti for next summer. ""Paradise is not only there, it can also be here and in our heads. That's why I wanted to create something special and exotic.
 
The designer drew from the archives while reflecting on the evolution of today's woman, for whom he designed an effortless and airy wardrobe, emphasising movement with ""sexy and elegant"" fringed dresses. Vapid yellow or turquoise dresses feature the iconic Diva pleat, light blouses are embellished with embroidered flowers, and vestal draped outfits are printed with lush carnation flower motifs.
 
White cotton lace jackets let the air flow. Stretch silk tops are paired with fringed cropped trousers. Everything is light and fluid.

"Oct 5, 2022","The first 2023 edition of Madrid’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week will be staged on February 15-19 at pavilion 14.1 of the Ifema Madrid exhibition centre, and elsewhere in the Spanish capital with its off-calendar programme.As the organisers announced on Tuesday, MBFW will be back to its usual slot in the international fashion week calendar. The event will be holding its 77th edition in February as customary, after the pandemic forced the organisers to postpone previous sessions to March, in 2022, and April, in 2020.

A new edition that, though not yet “officially open to applications,” is already generating “high expectations” among Spanish fashion designers and “a high volume of participation requests,” far in excess of the numbers recorded at MBFW’s most recent pre-pandemic editions. © EFE 2022.

"Oct 5, 2022","On the final day of the 26-day international catwalk season, Chanel staged a magnificent show in Virginie Viard’s homage to Last Year at Marienbad; Nicolas Ghesquière pulled off an agenda-setting collection for Louis Vuitton and A.W.A.K.E. Mode returned to Paris with experimental brio.  Chanel: Welcome back to MarienbadThe movie star was American and the photographers Dutch but this was the most French collection we’ve seen from Chanel in some time, presented impeccably before an enormous backdrop of film classic Last Year at Marienbad.A spring/summer 2023 collection staged before a truly gargantuan wraparound screen of 200 meters long and 10 meters high, projecting the black and white 1961 movie, and its central star Delphine Seyrig, whom fashion historians will recall was dressed mainly by Chanel.

A flotilla of hundreds of chauffeur driven limousines delivered some 1,500 guests to the show inside the Grand Palais Ephemère, where two entrance tunnels featured a collage of historical images and a great new campaign starring Kristen Stewart and shot by photo legends Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. The actual show intro was a charming little vignette film of Stewart out and about in Paris with four lotharios in tuxedos.“We are living in such an accelerated period of growth it gives me whiplash… It’s exhilarating,” says Stewart, as the camera captures her being pulled back by an invisible force in a Parisian impasse.

“It’s highly pressurised, as we are in this life-long, evolving art-changing project. To know who you are is subject to change. It’s not a fixed notion, the morphologies that define us and unite us,” she continues, answering an unseen interviewer as she emerged with from Le Champo, an art movie house in St Germain. Stewart even marches down Chanel’s famous glass walled staircase in its rue Cambon headquarters, attired in a shiny white bouclé suit that then appeared in the show.

The collage even featured in the opening look, a printed shirt worn over silk bloomers and flat shoes. Images of the symmetrical grand gardens of Bavaria where the film was shot evident on shirt and screen.

Chanel’s creative director Virginie Viard went for short this season, favouring the classic Chanel four-pocket jacket made as a dress but well up the thigh. She even made a lovely version in violet with a front placket. And when Virginie did send out a classic silken tweed jacket, she oft paired it with shorts.  

Her preferred footwear were black-toed pumps with floral straps worn with fishnet knee socks. Though there was nothing retro about these clothes from the polkadot trenches cinched by metal belts, to the pearl studded leather cocktails. 

While for evening, Viard wove in all sorts of feathers, rhinestones and bows that recalled the opulence of the film, none of which was shot in the Czech spa town after which it was named.

“The films we have seen, those that possess us and those we invent for ourselves, Marienbad, the Nouvelle Vague, the allure according to Gabrielle Chanel, Karl, the night, feathers, sequins, heels: I like it when things get mixed up,” remarked Viard.

What made this collection special was the ambiguity that defines Last Year at Marienbad. In the film, one is never certain if the couple had met one year before as the man insists, but the woman doesn’t recall. And in the collection one is never quite sure of the exact epoch of the clothes, yet somehow they are pretty much all clear expressions of Chanel’s DNA - poise, allure, polish and impertinence.Louis Vuitton: Nicolas sets the agenda again Sport met couture, hardware and amusement arcades in a tremendously forceful show at the Louvre by Louis Vuitton to round off four weeks of runway collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris. Last, but very much not least, this was a chic and startling collection by Nicolas Ghesquière for Vuitton, possibly his most brilliant to-date for the luxury marque. 

Staged in a pretty awesome setting, a giant elevated circular platform, where modes marched past open curtains as a bright sun peeped through a white sky. A set the brand entitled as a 'Flower Monster', courtesy of artist Philippe Parreno.

Above all, there was a wonderful sense of a humour about the clothes, which incorporated all sorts of LV equipment: closures, buckles, clasps, hinges and giant zips as objects or as prints. A heroic collection and show, opened by some brilliantly cut waistcoats and skirts reinforced by accordion pleat fabric tubes and held together by six-inch zip pull tabs.

Nicolas stepped that idea up a gear with some stunning prints, where meter-long grommet belts ran down the sides of blazers and the sleeves were printed in golden zips. Printed on leather or silk, they were zany, demanding to wear but unexpected and daring. Before going into overdrive with color blocking patchwork-leather baby doll dresses fronted by huge bows.

Plus, Ghesquière’s ingenious bags were first rate: like a smart new tote in the shape of a leather key holder, or another in the form of a huge baggage tag.

Though, the best moment was a sturdy replica bag of the founding family’s historic home in Asnières-sur-Seine. Almost a gingerbread house version of the original.

When it came to footwear, Nicolas was again thinking out of the box - with a new boxing boot meets techy sneaker. Ergonomic, funky and sprinkled with crystals, they will be huge hits, and influential.

Matter of fact, it has been some time since Ghesquière pulled off an agenda-setting collection, one that would drive the fashion zeitgeist. This collection will.    A.W.A.K.E. Mode: Experiments with brioOne of the more compelling voices in fashion design today is Natalia Alaverdian, the founder and designer of A.W.A.K.E. Mode, which staged its latest collection inside the American Cathedral of Paris.In whose hallowed halls, A.W.A.K.E. Mode presented a multi-material and highly experimental show, that ranged from romanticism to rough refinement. Far too many designers have come out of the pandemic playing safe, clinging to their self-perceived codes and DNA. Not Alaverdian, whom to her credit, continues to break new ground in terms of structure and vision.
 
Alaverdian is certainly skilled tailor, playing with proportions with audacity in tulip sleeved cotton dresses; open shouldered parachute silk baseball jackets or flight jackets, as well as some tremendous skirts finished at the bottom by menswear shirt cuffs.

She showed marvellous pencil skirts, beautiful draped culottes and scalloped front cocktails, while her sense of asymmetrical draping in flared skirts was admirable.

Natalia had two big ideas this season, the first being woven and mosaic leather. Seen in some great ecru, honey beige or contrast color skirts cut half-way down the calf. The other was intricate layering made in cut out squares and circles. Used to charming effect in cocktail dresses and art gallery opening evening gowns. 

Her experiments continued in accessories - from the woven metallic perspex heels, to perforated mesh mules.

At times, one cried out for the self editing button, as she piled on the cut-outs and foils. For often, the best ideas were the simplest - one shoulder recycled denim tops and flared bias-cut dresses.

Presented on a clever casting, given a Viking touch with their Valkyrie hairstyles.Though the opening the show with a bombastic industrial soundtrack just felt odd inside a church. 

The designer took a short bow before explaining backstage that, because the house had built up a substantial business online during the pandemic, she felt closer to her clients and more able to take more risks in her designs.

“Structure and experimenting with texture. There were lots of elements I had previously tried and they all came together this season,” smiled the designer, before embracing one of her biggest fans, Doja Cat, the rapper’s hair, neck and face all painted gold.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 4, 2022","In a standout moment from this Paris Fashion Week, the Coperni label ended its runway show by unveiling a dress of a whole new kind, literally painted live on Bella Hadid in front of a captivated audience. This striking image is now all over the web, proving a viral hit on social networks.Upcycling is a practice that is gradually becoming part of consumer buying behavior. But while shoppers now know that it's possible to transform waste of all kinds into clothing, they may not be aware that it's possible to turn a simple liquid into a spectacular dress. However, this is what the designers Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant, at the helm of the Coperni fashion house, did during this latest edition of Paris Fashion Week.

Top model Bella Hadid was chosen to close the show, but this time there was no question of a regular runway walk. Instead, the young model positioned herself in front of the guests in her underwear, waiting for the designers to work their magic. Which they then did, by spraying Bella Hadid with a white product. According to Vogue Business, this was a liquid containing cotton and synthetic fibers combined with a polymer solution, which transforms into fabric upon contact with the skin. Incredible, but true.This performance worthy of a science fiction scene has undoubtedly had the desired effect, as it went viral in a matter of hours. It led to tens of thousands of posts on Instagram, and even more ""likes,"" while the hashtag #sprayondress already counts over 3 million views on TikTok.

With its Media Impact Value (MIV) algorithm, which seeks to ""measure and benchmark the impact of all media placements and mentions across different Voices in the Fashion, Luxury, and Beauty industries,"" Launchmetrics reports that the MIV related to this moment is estimated at $26.3 million in the 48 hours following the show, . And that figure should continue to climb in the hours and days to come. All of which reflects the public's enthusiasm for a feat that is far from becoming the norm, but which is clearly the stuff of dreams.

"Oct 4, 2022","On the Paris catwalks on Monday, it was all about trimming, cutting, tearing, recomposing, regenerating and embellishing. The designers, including Sacai, Rokh, Lanvin and Germanier, demonstrated on the eighth day of the women's ready-to-wear shows for spring-summer 2023 that they are masters of the art of scissor handling.
 As the guests streamed into Sacai's large, colorful cube-shaped seating area, the last of the models arrived in a rush from the previous show, Stella McCartney, driven right up to the stage door. Fifty minutes later, the show began with a black and white optical illusion with moving stripes, which came to life as stripes, fringes and pleats.
 
Designer Chitose Abe wielded the scissors with joy and dexterity, cutting the bottoms of double-breasted dresses and maxi jackets. Hems on dinner jackets and sailors with gold buttons were cut into strips, which blended with the similar pleats and fringes of the large white shirts over which they were slipped. Without tops, these same blazers and pleated shirts became strapless dresses with frilly edges.

While the clothes were conscientiously slashed and reduced by a third, arms and legs were given volume through pagoda sleeves and trouser bottoms that flared into ruffles. Teddy jackets, safari jackets and anoraks were in turn decapitated. Without collar and shoulders, they were worn bustier-style.
 
The same treatment went for the lower part of the garment, which was reduced to an apron-like mini-skirt or a belt with two large side pockets, to be layered over a dress or trousers. Very practical to put your hands in, adding an air of natural nonchalance to the look. Everything fit together perfectly in this desirable collection made up of unique pieces that are easy to match with each other. Rokh plays the same game as Sacai, from whom he seems to have borrowed more than one idea. Clothes are unhooked, unbuttoned, unzipped, untied or even unraveled, transforming for example skirts and long dresses, thus rid of their heavy draped edge, into micro-minimal outfits. Sometimes, the designer simulated tears, like the blue stripes that zigzagged across certain beige dresses.

Like Abe, Rok Hwang likes to start with wardrobe classics, particularly trench coats and suits, which he broke down to recompose into long, fluctuating silhouettes. A trench coat became a bolero jacket associated with a skirt made from an off-cut of the same camel fabric wrapped in a spiral around the sides. Layers of fabric with fine or wider pleats were mixed and layered in long asymmetrical skirts in canvas or vinyl.

The belts, punctured with metal eyelets, were wrapped twice, tightly around the waist, falling in a ribbon along the legs. The garments were open in the back with a central, vertical row of buttons. Details and construction are everywhere. Perhaps a little too much, drowning out the purpose.
 
Lanvin, on the other hand, was much more minimalist with sober coats, shorts and suits, impeccably cut in a neutral palette. Creative director Bruno Sialelli gradually introduced sophisticated details into these simple looks, such as yellow embroidery or white buttons on a black coat or polka dots on leather or orange reptile skin coats.
 
Brocade fabrics and printed silks brightened up the ensemble in jackets and long skirts. Tulle dresses delicately caressed the body, while slender draped dresses were tinged with pastels.
 
Oriental music and tambourines gave rhythm to this aquatic fashion show, where the waves immersed the whole space, undulating on the walls and the sand-coloured carpet in changing reflections; the sea very present in the collection. The women dressed in fishing nets, sparkling tops and tunics. The nets were also used as bags, covered in crystals. Turquoise leotards with bonnets, like diving suits, were also worn, alongside long-haired mules that looked like flippers.

 After a moderate collection, Germanier gave us extravagance, with a spring-summer 2023 collection that was particularly exuberant and vital with a super colorful, both very glamorous and ethical, festive fashion. The label's founder, Switzerland's Kevin Germanier, also wielded scissors to cut holes and slash white shirts, whose gaps were then decorated with glitter silicone. Elsewhere, he redrew the shapes on flesh-coloured tulle tunics, some parts of which were ultra-decorated with an accumulation of embellishments, while others were left bare.
 
This season, more than ever, the designer used everything and anything to hand to make his recycled fairy outfits: feathers, stones, large sequins, rhinestones, paper or fabric fringes, pearls. These different elements were arranged according to colors and shapes, in large garlands or volumes.
 
Decorations were entangled in fishnet dresses as though caught in a spider's web. Entire dresses were made of multicolored plastic necklaces. And light rainbow ostrich feathers made up a majestic capote with a large floating headdress to match, for a final, highly applauded look.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 4, 2022","Paris Fashion Week Monday: Stella McCartney was all in the family; Thom Browne needed an edit; Zimmermann looked very at-home in Paris, and Lutz Huelle triumphed at AZ Factory.Stella McCartney: Family affairA full show of support from LVMH for Stella McCartney, as her brand’s backer, CEO Bernard Arnault and his three eldest children sat front row for the UK designer’s latest show.Staged outside the Pompidou Centre on a chilly Monday morning, with a collection that referenced the links between fashion and art. The invitation featured an image from Japanese graphic artist Yoshitomo Nara – and his slogan ""Change the History,” the same image appearing on a T-shirt on the cobblestone runway. Stella even worked with him 20 years ago when she opened her NYC store.

Plus, by being held on grand slanting courtyard at the modern art museum, thousands of fans had the chance to witness the show live. And able to enjoy one of Stella’s best collections in years.Presented on a series of colourful stripe catwalks, the cast marched at all sorts of angles, in a slight fashion malfunction perhaps. The collection, on the other hand, was focused and sharp. Especially the great tailoring, light and soft versions of classic Savile Row suiting, given fresh impetus with their savvy sense of volume and clever detailing. Pairing them with crystal and sequinned tops or body jewelry to add great punch.

Stella also draped with aplomb, with lots of racy bias cut cocktails worn with double-breasted blazers. And in a season of jumpsuits, McCartney showed some of the best - from soft buttercup fighter pilot versions, to a fully tailored tracksuit at the finale, worn by Amber Valletta.

Paired together with faded denim looks and a series of bags made in vegan leather. Stella still very much the leader in fashion’s slow march towards sustainability and respect for animal rights. Her long held positions, a salutary message to far too many of her colleagues.

All told, a fashionable victory for the designer, and a sign that her brand’s future looks far rosier chez LVMH. No wonder, her dad, Beatle Paul McCartney, was mock dancing in his front row seat, rubbing shoulders with his neighbour Bernard Arnault.

Who reacted by filming the finale on his iPhone, to the amusement of daughter Delphine and sons Antoine and Alexandre. Always a good sign for a designer when BA does that. 
 Thom Browne: Royalist ready-to-wear, American designerTalent often comes with self-indulgence, especially in fashion and, particularly, if your name is Thom Browne, as he proved with this show, held in a new location for the American designer, the Palais Garnier opera house.Thom is a great designer, who reinvented the men’s suit and, to a certain extent, the runway show. Turning the latter into works of performance art. However, the whole point of a fashion show is to grip an audience by a powerful aesthetic statement, not irritate them. And the mad scramble to exit this show - which lasted 45 minutes, where the average show’s duration is 15 - only underlined how relieved people were to leave. Talk about losing your audience.

Yet, there was plenty to admire about these clothes; whose key story was the meeting of crinoline and cape. First off a madcap version of a duchess having a Louis-the-XIV-fantasy moment, a towering figure in royal blue frock coat-meets-cape, with gilded embroidery. 

Next came a score of giant cardinal worthy capes, in hues of cobalt blue, mint yellow or creamy orange. Cut like a Velasquez portrait of a Renaissance pope, but with funky makeup Francis Bacon would have admired. Capes cut into giant ruched flowers and sleeves so large they could have hidden a basketball. Hair nets over models heads, hair done up like spiky phalluses. Giant clogs and running socks on their feet. If that sounds like rather weird that’s because it was, even if also rather beautiful.

Everything going into overdrive with pleated pinafores and puckered wee boleros, finished with Thom’s signature dachshund print. Done in the red, white and blue of the French flag.

His central circular motif all over the finale in multiple candy-hued redingotes. Polkadot overdrive that made the show stall. Clothes destined for a museum rather than real life. And, a moment for all his wit and humour, when Browne might have to rethink his obsession with performance fashion.

Even four flannel suited bearers carrying a huge pink half-sized Cadillac in lightweight mesh with Lady Penelope emoting inside could not quite save this show.Zimmermann: Wonderland in the Petit Palais Paris’ biggest debut this season was Zimmermann, a dynamic Australian brand, whose aesthetic best represents their homeland’s reputation as the 'Lucky Country'.Entitled 'Wonderland', the collection’s well-spring was a story told to designer Nicky Zimmermann by her grandmother of a long forgotten roller coaster built in the late 19th century, which has since disappeared.

Prints of that long forgotten big dipper, located in Tamarama Bay, where Zimmermann lived for over 20 years, were the key elements in the collection.

“An old roller coaster, it is unthinkable they would built it today,” laughed the designer.

Seen in gloriously color in bouffant frocks; ruffled cocktails; flamenco dresses; gowns with tulip sleeves and even laced up corsets.

Not that Nicky overly relied on prints - considering her deft use of white and ecru. You had to love the padded judo jackets finished with soaring collars; knobby cotton baseball jackets worn with ragged lace skirts or guipure lace blouses over Bondi Beach cargo shorts.

Tamarama today is sometimes nicknamed Glamorama, due to its chic local residents, but those of us who have surfed it know it for a legendary powerhouse rip that only the experienced, or very naive, tackle. One silk dress in the show even read, 'Surf to Grow'.

And brave is what Nicky Zimmermann definitely is, having the guts to take her brand to Paris before the toughest audience in fashion. And presenting a collection that looked very at home in Paris Fashion Week. Expect her to return.

“When we began making this collection I had no idea that we would be showing it in Paris. But after the pandemic it felt right to travel and to come here. I didn’t make any special alterations because we were coming to France. We just decided to enjoy the experience. And my team loved it,” she enthused.

Staged in the colonnade and garden of the Petit Palais, the show rambled and lost momentum badly. But what’s great about Zimmermann is that it’s a very democratic brand, that’s attractive to multiple generations and sufficiently flexible to suit multiple sizes and morphologies. This show and collection will win it legions of more followers. Welcome to Paris Nicky.Lutz Huelle X AZ Factory: Lutz loves street coutureThe unstated question entering the one-off collection of Lutz Huelle for AZ Factory was whether this fledgling fashion concept has a future or not. And the answer, judging from this collection, is a very definite, 'yes'.Huelle, a German who lives in Paris, is one of the most interesting indie designers in fashion, famous in a strange way for having his best ideas copied by many lesser talents. With this collection, it was about him respecting, and yet extending, the DNA of a house founded by the late great Alber Elbaz, a creator of clear and powerful codes.

Thankfully, the result was a balanced cocktail of Huelle’s street style, delicacy with denim and sense of rock n roll, married to the hipster grand couture of Elbaz, blended with the one virtual show Alber created for AZ Factory.

Though bankrolled by the deep pockets of luxury giant group Richemont, AZ Factory is very wisely managed like a start-up. Its atelier and offices are located inside the Cartier Foundation, Richemont’s most famous brand. And that is where they staged this show, before some beautiful works of demi-abstract Aboriginal art and watched by other amigos of the house, like Thebe Magugu, who have designed for AZ factory already.

Kicking off with The Undertones classic 'Teenage Kicks' on the soundtrack, Lutz sent out a great opening trilogy: snazzy, sleeveless tuxedo jacket, finished with black nylon ruffled elbows over denim shorts and boot that looked like one garment. Oversized blazer with denim mini and cool tuxe with embossed buttons. Lots of frayed trim, how Alber would have like it.

Referring to Elbaz as a “absolute icon” who created couture in a very easy manner, Lutz explained he wanted to “bring the street and rock-n-roll and a little drama to the clothes that should still look precious.”

Huelle worked with Elbaz's “amazing team, and we became friends in two seconds,” determined on making clothes that worked in multiple contexts, and on different ages. He even took a joint bow with six of them.

Diamante crystals in most looks, from power boots and high heels, to posh-punk multi-strand necklaces. And simple but convincing ideas - like a back to front tuxedo shirt dress, with the placket on the back. Alber’s ruffled romanticism riffed on over a dozen looks with huge boss and swirls of fabric.

Though Huelle’s boldest idea were the techno floral camouflage prints, created from sketches and revamped on computers. Seen blurry, on men and women in nylon raincoats, pants, drapes and ruffles; or on country house ball gowns or even saucy cocktails. Only lament, we could have done with more than one version of the print.

All told, perhaps not an epic show, staged on a dank Monday night, but a telling vision of fashion’s future, and one that suggests AZ Factory has legs.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2022","Paris's Rue Saint-Martin was taken by storm on Friday evening, with traffic practically at a standstill around the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. In the hubbub and confusion, a heterogeneous crowd was gathered outside, which included photographers, journalists, influencers, celebrities, curious passers-by and fans hoping to catch a glimpse of international stars. Coperni, a social media favourite, is currently one of the most desired French brands in the fashion industry. In the Textiles room of the museum, the public was growing impatient after a more than 40 minute delay. The show began after the arrival of its last guest: Kylie Jenner, dressed for the occasion in a low-cut electric blue mini-dress and futuristic sunglasses. The youngest member of the Kardashian clan had a very busy Paris Fashion Week and attended the shows of Acne Studios and Balmain, among others. Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant of Coperni presented a fashion show in the form of a tribute to strong and powerful women. But the star did not suspect for a moment that her presence would be more than anecdotal ten minutes later.

True to its sensual and modern signature style, Coperni reinterpreted the men's suit in the form of hybrid garments, combining layered jackets or integrating them into the back of decidedly feminine fitted dresses, while button-down jackets were worn over white tank tops, a must-have item for spring/summer 2023. Asymmetrical mini-dresses with side slits were adorned with lingerie-inspired details, black ensembles with fuchsia and metallic blue accents and exaggerated shoulder pads mimicked robotic armor, low-rise cargo pants played it casual, while mini-shorts hugged the models' figures. A series of pastel looks, decorated with small sparkling crystals, enhanced this collection in search of renewed femininity.But the main highlight arrived at the end of the show, with a live performance that went viral in just a matter of minutes. A moment that will have reminded fashion insiders of the spring 1999 collection during which Alexander McQueen captivated his audience with robots spray-painting a model wearing a white dress.

On Friday night, Coperni achieved a double performance by entrusting the stage to Bella Hadid, appearing naked as a blank canvas before two professionals in charge of spraying her with fabric spray paint. The performance lasted less than seven minutes, leaving the whole audience speechless. Obviously, the videos did not take long to flood social media platforms.

With this futuristic and visually immersive project, the brand reaffirmed its innovative spirit by creating a live dress using a spray fabric developed by Spanish inventor Manel Torres. Upon contact with the famous model's body, the spray solidified into a tight-fitting, latex-like fabric. Another woman entered the scene during the final minutes to refine the look, making a side slit and positioning the straps on Bella's shoulders, sublimating her appearance of a Hellenic sculpture.
 
""This is a moment in fashion history,"" commented the specialists in the corridors at the exit of the crowded show. Meanwhile, social media networks were already multiplying the images of the performance. The challenge was brilliantly met.Vivienne Westwood pays tribute to ParisA few hours later, on Saturday October 1, another eagerly awaited fashion show took place in the Marais district of Paris. The British designer Vivienne Westwood invited her fans to the Gaîté Lyrique theater, where her husband and creative director of the brand Andreas Kronthaler, paid a personal tribute to the French capital.""This is my dream collection. I couldn't explain it to Vivienne, she didn't know, I just had to do it. I walked out of my house and thought I was in Paris: something in the sky made me realize how much I wanted to be there,"" explained the Austrian designer. True to the brand's theatrical character, the casting mixed male and female models perched on oversized platform shoes, at times wearing metallic masks or impossibly large headdresses, walking on a circular platform where they posed for the cameras.

Vivienne Westwood's signature punk style was offset with Renaissance references, with wide satin dresses featuring layered tulle ruffles, refined corsets, ruched sleeves and baroque floral patterns. Ripped shirt collars, harnesses, layered knit and crochet pieces, or a voluminous silky satin dress that wrapped around a model looked like something straight out of a period movie.

Of the materials used, the only ones commissioned by the label were silk brocades by Stephen Walters. The rest came from dormant stocks and recycled second-hand pieces, reinforcing the historical nature of the looks, which captivated the front row audience where singers Halsey and Doja Cat and model Coco Rocha were sat. Renowned names also grazed the catwalk; Russian model Irina Shayk opened the show, followed by Bella Hadid, dressed this time in a white blazer worn with boxing gloves.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2022","Sunday was a hectic day for Paris Fashion Week. The designers seemed to all have received a memo to spice up their presentations. After Balenciaga's show in the mud at Villepinte and Givenchy's show under umbrellas at the Jardin des Plantes, Ottolinger had his audience sitting on the floor, while Beautiful People sent them to the Arab World Institute’s ninth floor and Atlein started almost an hour late. In the evening the rain had finally stopped and we could finally catch our breath, at the GmbH show under the arcades of the Lycée Molière.
  
On the seventh day of the women's ready-to-wear fashion week for spring-summer 2023, Ottolinger invited its audience to contort themselves to sit on small mattresses placed on the floor, without sticking their feet out onto the carpet. The brand presented a fashion show from the bottom up, with blinding and flashing spotlights and techno music.

Models were in a hurry, rushing in with their wheeled suitcases in hand. They unleashed lively energy in sporty outfits, where clothes overlapped and intermingled. The brand's signature cords were everywhere, twirling around the body. In zippers in skirts, slashed trousers and small jackets, drawing a curved line in a tight strapped jumpsuit, or like an earthworm draped under the chest on a dress.The bras are reduced to thin, intertwined strips, while the heeled pumps look like they have been stuck in a puddle of varnish paint and models carried long oblong shaped bags resembling a rifle carrier.

 Atlein also had plenty of cords and laces, but this time with metal tips. They swung along the body, giving movement to the silhouette. Threaded into the structuring lines of the garments, they created a gathered effect up the arms and legs, and of course on the body in dresses, tops as well as tight-fitting skirts, highlighting the model's silhouette.

Antonin Tron's favorite jersey fabric hugged the body. It drapes and takes its shape like a second skin. Both comfortable and sensual, the outfits are eroticized with slits that reach the top of the thigh, bare backs and deep necklines, as well as orange swimming costumes and outfits with reptile prints.

In the evening, the silhouette stretches out in long sheaths and lights up, sometimes in a straight, matte black skirt that glows in the light, sometimes in shiny velvet dresses with coppery or metallic reflections as if dipped in bronze or silver. 
At GmbH there was a zen and exotic atmosphere with incense and traditional Indian music, while the models nonchalantly walked through the arcades surrounding the large courtyard of the Lycée Molière in chic summer outfits, where denim mini-shorts, also available in black or gold leather and in vinyl, are combined with very elegant white shirts.

The duo comprising Pakistani-Norwegian photographer Benjamin Alexander Huseby and Turkish-German designer Serhat Isik took their inspiration from India this season, concocting a collection that is comfortable, fresh and cool.

Shirt and sarong ensembles were cut from delicate madras or sumptuous damask silk fabrics, with the shirt sometimes swapped for a simple white sweater. Satin maxi jackets were worn with metallic or neoprene wetsuit-like thigh-high boots and the same material was used to make very comfortable five-toed slippers. For the evening, the GmbH man or woman opts for a dinner jacket with mini shorts, wrapped in long fur coats or a long furry boa.

Beautiful People wants to transform violence and war into ""joy, peace and harmony"". It does this through chameleon-like clothing, starting with a series of military looks, which metamorphose one after the other in a dance choreography.

Army jackets can be turned inside out to become pretty jackets with wide collars, while other military like outfits can be unzipped in front and behind along the legs to become a skirt, the lining of a parka becomes an orange mackintosh coat.

"Oct 3, 2022","Apologies to The Who, but it seems that the kids aren't all right. At least not at Enfants Riches et Déprimés's Spring/Summer 2023 show, which took place last night in Paris's Lycée Henri IV, one of France's top-ranked public high schools.If Henri Alexander Levy has always channeled -- to not say embodied, as the designer himself wears his hair bleached blond and his skin très inked -- a Neo-punk identity, it seems to now have evolved into that of schoolgirl-rebel-gone-gothic. For the girls, long corseted bustier dresses paired with matching jet black chokers. And for the boys? Chunky rain boots, fitted dress suits (though the pants are punctured with bullet-shaped holes) and lots and lots of dangling silver chains, dripping from the shirts' collars onto the pants' belt loops. 

Backstage, Levy reveals his inspiration was a ""neo-punk, American Beauty-type communist character"", referencing Sam Mendes' 2000 bittersweet dramedy about how an average family father, Lester, falls in love with his sulfurous teenage daughter's friend. Spolier alert: things don't end well for Lester, and his deadpan, moping spawn moves on with her voyeuristic boyfriend without an ounce of regret or sadness regarding her father's fate. Once again, Levy seems to hint to the fact that his enfants riches are, indeed, also very déprimés (depressed in French). In an era where youth is stricken with drug addiction worldwide, the designer embellishes his models' boots with blood-red NA initials: Narcotics Anonymous. And in a war-ridden climate, his enfants terribles also yearn for a revolution. On the back of a leather jacket, an illustration of Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong. And for headwear, drooping caps bearing a bright carmine star - obviously reminiscent of Che Guevara.

Levy stresses that this collection was only about ""aesthetics and emotions"", and insists there is no intellectual affinity to it. Yet, one can't suppress a comparison between the designer and that one angsty 15-year old genius we could find sitting in the back of the classroom doodling or staring out the window. Like the latter, he doesn't seem to fully grasp the political and societal complexity of his show, nor the dystopian representation of a jaded juvenescence.

"Oct 3, 2022","The urge to set sail clearly resounded in Paris, during this first proper post-Covid women's ready-to-wear fashion week. For Spring/Summer 2023, more than one designer expressed their desire to travel to distant lands. This was notably the case on Friday, when Leonard Paris took its audience to a Caribbean lagoon, Giambattista Valli to India and Christian Wijnants to the open sea. Meanwhile, Issey Miyake paid a touching tribute to its founder, who passed away in August.The Japanese fashion brand's show was indeed quite emotional as the black-and-white portrait of the designer who died in August in Japan at the age of 84 was projected on the walls of the dark hangar, with the following sentence written in his handwriting: ""I believe there is hope in design.""

The grand space, barely illuminated by a full moon, and several large sculptures covered with white sheets then welcomed a delicate and poetic fashion show accompanied by the gentle sounds of a grand piano.The first minimalist black-and-white looks emerged onto the catwalk under a bright white light. Fabric panels seemed to have been delicately placed on the body. Pinched on one side, exposing one shoulder, they effortlessly draped the silhouette. After this interlude, the show resumed its course in a dimly lit room, where vibrant colors exploded onto monochrome pieces, such as lime yellow on a squared-off raincoat and on a dress draped in a spiral around the body, red on a pleated jersey dress, pink on a tunic, mauve on a tight knit dress, and green on rippled mesh dresses with billowing sleeves.

Designer Satoshi Kondo shapes, kneads, and molds like a sculptor. The knitted fabrics spiked up on the sides, arms and chest in the shape of strange animals. Beautiful knits revealed three-dimensional textures like embroideries. Oversized jackets, capes and ponchos took on the appearance of a cocoon. A white knitted dress revealed a black shadow on its back. The show ended with the company's refined choreography ""I Could Never Be A Dancer"" for a final emotional moment.A new chapter began at Leonard Paris with designer Georg Lux's very first show. The atmosphere was electric Friday morning at the show of the Parisian brand, which was sold last summer by the founding Tribouillard family to the Japanese group Sankyo Seiko, with its CEO Akira Inoue seated in the front row. The creative direction was inspired by Leonard's heyday, when the label dressed jet setters of the 1970s, and imagined a trip to the Caribbean.
 
The show immersed the audience into the sunny setting of Mustique Island, once frequented by Princess Margaret with a fauna of high society members and artists. Leonard's signature motifs from the 1970s, featuring large tropical flowers and bluish foliage, were resurrected and displayed in an aquatic color palette, yet enlivened by vibrant shades of pink, orange and sunny yellow, onto a series of small structured dresses and flowing oversized silhouettes.
 
The lineup included caftans, boubous, gypsy dresses, as well as pirate pants with wide ruffles and mini-skirt suits, and not to mention a turquoise macramé tunic with long fringe sprinkled with golden tassels, like fish caught in a fisherman's net. Everything oozed and exuded a carefree summer vibe. Walking on platform sandals or barefoot, with a pair of espadrilles in hand, protected from the sun by floppy beach hats, the models walked while the rows of colorful bracelets on their arms clinked, with their ears adorned with large sea anemones.

For the first time, the house introduced denim in a few printed and ripped pieces with embossed seasonal motifs. Another novelty seen in the collection was the introduction of three masculine, casual-chic looks.The same desire for warm weather and carefreeness was also felt in Christian Wijnants' fashion show, which turned Paris into a golden beach. The models returned from the beach in long tunics or hooded caftans in different colors of the sunset (yellow, orange, mauve), adorned with a garland of fabric such as a flower necklace. Their accessories included summer essentials: sunglasses, sandals or flip-flops, with a few grains of sand still stuck to the face. 

""After the pandemic, I had this strong urge to be exotic and travel,"" said the designer backstage. ""I wanted to celebrate the summer season in the form of an end of day at the beach. There is freshness and lots of colors to deliver a positive and optimistic message,"" he explained.
 
The lightweight wardrobe featured washed silks, linen, bleached denim and crinkled materials in baggy pants, impalpable shirts, long dresses fastened with simple bows, macramé tops, ultra-light trench coats and bermuda shorts, while white cotton dresses were embellished with crochet embroidery.
 For his physical return to the catwalk, Giambattista Valli also traveled to an exotic destination. He flew the audience to India, more precisely to Jaipur in Rajasthan, to the land of the maharajas, with women richly dressed in turbans and adorned with a thousand jewels, while their eyes were kept hidden by star-shaped glasses.

The collection's lace sets mimicked the effect of the back of Thonet wicker chairs. Pinks took over flowing ball gowns or ran up the length of translucent organza pieces, while trouser-bra sets were rendered in pink lace.

The collection sparkled with a thousand lights. From top, with the models' foreheads illuminated by a diamond Indian 'Bindi', to bottom, where their feet were clad with gladiator sandals featuring golden laces encrusted with pearls. The ensembles were brimming with crystals and golden glitter. Golden reflections lit up princess dresses in tulle or muslin, while large earrings glistened on the models' ears.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2022","Paris Fashion Week weekend: returning warriors from Balenciaga; 'Unboxing' at Valentino; a centennial celebration at Akris; rocker romanticism at Elie Saab and fashion fiasco at Givenchy.Balenciaga: Digging in the dirtReturning refugees trudging through a mud-strewn landscape; huge holes in the soil like the aftermath of intense shelling, at Balenciaga, in the latest remarkable set by the house’s creative director Demna.The models all marching in mud and huge puddles in a giant set built inside the Parc des Expositions, 20 kilometres north of Paris. Thundering techno music throughout in a co-end show, where several models carried papooses with lifelike baby dolls inside them.  

“Yes, the babes were very realistic, rather creepy. We had a very hard time styling them,” laughed Demna.A particularly striking image in a particular striking show, where most of the clothes were worn, muddy, smeared and stained. Some of the cast carried battered toy bears, pearls in their noses, B logo bracelets around their necks.

Opening with Kanye West, playing a security guard in black flak jacket, hoodie padded pants, boots and cap, splashing mud with every step. Skinny waifs followed, often shirtless and in mesh tanks worn over artfully worn and splattered oversized jeans.

“What is luxury?I have been dealing with it since I began. Is it a cashmere sweater or can it be anything? And, in my view, it can. Covering this in mud is a reference to that. The mud makes it all real,” explained Demna, wearing a greased and smeared black hoodie.

“To make this hoodie dirty is much more difficult than it appears. We have a whole department that dyes things. It’s polar opposite of what we think of as luxury, which is meant to be polished. But here the context is what makes it luxury,” he argued.

Very much the make-up tour de force of the season. A cast covered in horns, spikes shooting out of they cheeks, pearls from their lips. 

Plus, Demna’s choice of bags were something else. A new arm-tote, composed of matching sleeve and tote wrapped under the arm. Some paired with two-meter long snake-like stoles. Many models with puffer bags over their arms or bags scrunched up in their hands. The latter on closer inspection were faux oversized packets of crisps reading, potato chips Balenciaga Paris, by Lays, a popular PepsiCo brand.

Clothes of considerable volume, from skirt/trousers slit at the front, to a brilliant post-nuclear punk dress with straps, zips and studs.
 
“The one thing that came from Balenciaga was a puffer bag, which he made as a muff. In this show, I am trying to find out why I am a designer. So this was very personal statement.  Society and luxury put us all in boxes. That’s how I felt all my life. I have been punched in the face all my life. That is what society and the Internet especially does. But you have to be a boxer and when you get knocked down you have to stand up. I am naturally optimistic but we cannot be very optimistic right now. So I am more hopeful, than optimistic.” Valentino: Maximalism meets minimalismMaximalism met minimalism in a pathbreaking collection by Pierpaolo Piccioli for the house of Valentino at Sunday lunchtime, where a good quarter of the audience were admirers dressed in scores of pink looks from last season’s all pink show.Even if the most beautiful image in the front row was Zendaya, glistening in black sequins. Her arrival, 40 minutes after the official start time, causing a huge chorus of screams from the thousands of fashion fans and fashion wannabes outside.

Suitably settled, the first model appeared in Piccoli’s new multi-V logo print named Toile Iconographe, made into a very fine cape dress with matching tights, shoes, clutch and, even, face, courtesy of some remarkably dexterous logo face paint.

Piccioli has rarely draped better clothes, from splendidly sculpted mat brown chiffon gowns, or ingenious black georgette cape dresses that could either wrap around the torso, or be flung over the shoulder to reveal an open back.

Pierpaolo’s big concept for next spring is called 'Unboxing', or extending the houses codes of chiffon, bow, sequins and a little grandeur depending on your personal take in terms of proportion and sizing.

This season he proposed a new flesh-toned lycra leotard and body, the better to accompany beautifully and somewhat revealing narrow cocktail dresses in marvellous displays of sequins and plastic shards.  

An expanded casting, for an expanded repertory of ideas, as the designer brilliantly took the Valentino DNA into new territory. His cast even included a punk with giant Mohican. Hard to imagine Valentino Garavani trying that. 

In a pre-show preview, Pierpaolo explained that he had met a young man in Rome, who told him he always wanted to model in a show, but would never change anything about his look to achieve his dream.

“I told him he would have to change nothing and cast him in the show,” chuckled the Roman-born, sending out a surprising cabine, that suited his path-breaking collection. Akris: An authoritative anniversaryHow do you dress women of authority, ladies of intelligence and females in position of power, without falling into the trap of reproducing masculine codes to allegedly empower them?One designer who has repeatedly come up with smart solutions is Albert Kriemler, the creative director of family owned marque Akris.

One of the many proofs of his success is that the house this weekend celebrated its centenary with refined and noble collection, staged with elan beneath a threatening sky at the fountain of the Palais de Tokyo. With a special backdrop for the day, Ugo Rondinone’s 'We Are Poems' flickering rainbow sculpture, underling founder and grandmother Alice’s stated goal “to define a woman’s presence and enhance her charisma.”

Kriemler is also one of those designers whose work begins with a sketch. Non-professionals would be surprised how many of today’s creative directors do not make that their starting point.

Albert’s graphic sketch of a peak shouldered and belted wrap alpha coat reviving a classic of the house, appeared in his elegant show program. Before then a beautifully cut coat opened the show. Made in double face vicuna and worn with matching sneakers it looked super classy, and very today. It was culled from a version Albert discovered in the house’s archives dating back to 1978, part of an extended reconsideration of the brand’s legacy to celebrate its centennial.

Akris, which was born in St. Gallen, generally includes the defining fabric of its hometown, guipure lace, in most collections. Rarely with such distinction as this season with copper-hued blouses, faded gold dresses and romantic white blouse.

Seen before the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower across the river, his cast was marvellously heterogeneous - young ladies with giant funky afros; cropped black haired early thirties somethings; gray hair beauties and polished Parisians. Whatever their origins, they all had great poise.

Add in some great croquis-print jumpsuits or trenches; perforated mesh cocktails and gowns; and a quartet of sleeveless gorge front pleated gowns and you had a great fashion statement. 

Grandmother Alice Kriemler-Schoch, who founded the business in 1922, would surely be proud to see this third generation led by Albert and CEO brother Peter make such a success out of the brand. Switzerland’s answer to Chanel, that has dressed everyone from Amal Clooney and Condoleezza Rice, to Angelina Jolie and Charlene, Princess of Monaco, who sat at Albert’s side at a celebratory dinner inside the Palais de Tokyo. Supper washed down by another Swiss discovery, Domaine Donatsch, a chardonnay to rival many great burgundies.Givenchy: From the Jardin des Plantes to the Bermuda TriangleThe weather gods were cruel to Givenchy this season and the fashion muses were pretty mean too. An outdoor show delayed by rain for 40 minutes, and a collection that was truly a damp squib. From first to last.Even the presence of supermodels like Bella and Gigi Hadid could not save this collection, so devoid of finesse, and so clichéd throughout. Gigi, in particular, dressed in a truly appalling logo denim combo of oversized jacket and cargo-pocket skirt. Bella fared, if anything, worse. Her hands stuck in a shabby denim mid-calf skirt and nasty denim bra.

As for the evening wear, a series of clumsily draped cocktails, often cut chopped off at one side to reveal an interior bra. Quite how anyone would think you could include these looks on the runway of one of Paris’ great couture house, was hard to fathom.

Plus, the less said about the laced hooker booties, which most of the cast wore, the better.

The one good thing about this show was the runway and setting made of dark brown cork. Which also made it easier to dry, allowing the likes of Kanye West, Olivia Palermo, Georgia May Jagger and Noomi Rapace to take their seats in some comfort.

Other than that, this felt like a train wreck. Avant moi le deluge. Doubly disappointing since the house’s designer Matthew Williams had presented a very fine and inventive menswear collection in June. 

Quite why this brand has proved so problematic since the retirement of Hubert de Givenchy is hard to comprehend. Three British designers - John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald barely lasted a few seasons, immediately turning Givenchy into a revolving door. Riccardo Tisci, at least made it a success d’estime in his extended stay with his gothic Mediterranean mode, without growing revenues significantly. And by basically ignoring most of the house’s codes. Before another Brit’, Clare Waight Keller, restored much of the founder’s DNA though without gaining much traction.

Little wonder, Givenchy appears to be the Bermuda Triangle of fashion, a storied house where even greatly talented designers tend to get lost. As Williams did, pretty completely, this season.Elie Saab: Warm, wealthy and wearableA swift change of direction at Elie Saab, where the Phoenician couturier injected a dash of cool artist into his aesthetic, and was all the better for it.Playing with his preferred florals, though ramped up with some well-judged color blocking - seen in blends of canary yellow and white, seen in dip-dyed ruffled skirts and sporty bras.

Though Elie’s key idea was almost a dozen looks in sturdy lace, crocheted into charming crop tops, high-slit skirts, wide-legged pants and even hoodies, for a chill sunset. All anchored by clever rope covered platforms and platform wedges.

Yet the heart of the matter with Elie will always be evening, this season starring rock goddess. His gowns were jazzed up with bouquets of floral yarn-embroidery vines sewn over nude tulle and cocktail cut-out dresses.

Before changing gears again with flowing georgette dresses in dark pink and Imperial Roman purple. Finished off by enamel floral brooches on bows, Elie Saab monogram earrings and ear cuffs. 

Just like the novel new take on Saab by Saab, his front row was an eclectic mix, including the likes of Olivia Palermo, Gulf TV host and star Diala Makki and Guram Gvasalia.

“Timeless chic with a touch of garden freshness,” was Saab’s comment.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 1, 2022","With a vast wardrobe catering to everything from ""House of the Dragon"" to ""The Crown"", Spain's Peris Costumes has carved out a well-tailored niche for itself, renting costumes to producers across the globe.""Here, you can find everything,"" says CEO Javier Toledo showing off a vast array of costumes and accessories -- from suits of armour to frock coats, sailor suits and monastic robes.

All around him mannequins dressed in 18th-century gowns stand next to posters of the many films his company has worked on in recent years. ""There are starting to be rather a lot,"" admits the 63-year-old entrepreneur with white hair and a neatly trimmed goatee whose business is based in Algete, a small town just outside Madrid. 

Since Toledo took over 10 years ago, the business has been transformed. 

What began as a small family firm set up by tailors specialising in theatre costumes in the eastern coastal city of Valencia in 1856 has become a world leader in costume hire for the film industry.

And it's a success story closely linked to the rise of on-demand streaming giants such as Netflix, Disney+ and HBO. 

""We have responded to the changes that have taken place in the market,"" he told AFP, pointing notably to the explosion in popularity ""of the series"".

When he bought the company, Peris Costumes only had a dozen staff, all based in Madrid. 

Today, the group employs 250 people and has offices or workshops in 15 capital cities, including Budapest, Berlin, Paris and Mexico City. 

""During the first half of the year, we were involved in almost 600 productions. And by the end of the year we're hoping that will be more than 1,000,"" says marketing director Myriam Wais. 

- Elizabeth Taylor's 'Cleopatra' jewellery - 

Among the films and series that have chosen the company are numerous super-productions which are very demanding in terms of period or fantasy costumes.

Whether it's ""The Rings of Power"", ""Mulan"" or ""Marco Polo"", many productions prefer to rent costumes rather than invest in making their own.

""Trying to make (the costumes) from scratch is practically impossible because of the time and costs involved,"" says Toledo. 

And producers appreciate ""having costumes that have been worn in and aged with time"", he explains.

To expand its catalogue, Peris Costumes has in recent years has bought up millions of gowns, hats, pairs of shoes and uniforms from studio giants like Warner Bros. 

And all these complement its own in-house collections put together in the workshops of its costume designers. 

""In total, we have more than 10 million articles"" of clothing and accessories, says Wais, reeling off a list of the most popular styles and eras.

It is, she says, ""the biggest wardrobe in the world"". 

In a nearby room, four garment makers are working with pieces of leather, with a hammer-like maul and pliers on hand.

""Right now, we're working on our inventory but there are also orders,"" she says. 

In another room is the jewellery workshop, where close to 20,000 pieces are stored, including the jewels worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1963 epic ""Cleopatra"" and the papal cross worn by Jude Law in the 2016 series ""The Young Pope"".

- Damaged but never discarded -

At Peris Costumes, the rule is to never throw anything away, not even if it is damaged during filming. 

""We have an area called 'The Walking Dead' in which we put everything that is broken or damaged but that could be reused,"" Wais says, the term referencing a TV series about zombie apocalypse survivors.

With demand showing little sign of ebbing, this Spanish outfitter has recently started digitising some of its catalogue with the help of a studio equipped with 144 high-resolution cameras.

Dubbed Peris Digital, this service lets production companies ""create 3D images"" of costumes which can be used ""during post-production"", Wais says. 

And this ""virtual wardrobe"" has also proved popular with the makers of video games, the company says.

"Oct 1, 2022","A magnificent show by a Northern Irishman; an impressive debut by a UK star; poetic fashion from a Japanese veteran and a moment of homage to an American. Displays by four foreigner designers in the past 36 hours have rarely made Paris Fashion Week seem more international.Loewe: Coveted repetition Jonathan Anderson telegraphed his concept for his latest stellar collection for the house of Loewe by sending every guest an invitation that included a bright red anthurium flower with central poker-shaped spathe.The same flamingo flower - made of plexiglass - greeting guests at the show, staged inside the Garde Républicaine equestrian stables. A flower so large it looked like it might grow through the giant glass roof of the building. A 3D rendering of an actual tropical flower, which managed to be both sinister and yet comforting. What Jonathan called “an Eyes Wide Shut” moment.

Anthuriums then appearing in over a score of looks. On just one foot of the pumps worn below the opening bell-jar shape dress worn by actress Taylor Russell. Or as a breastplates for several micro frocks; sprouting from shoes; or even dangling from side totes.“I like this idea of something in nature that looks fake but is real. The idea of iconography, and things that remind you of something else,” explained Anderson post show.

Yet the biggest news was Anderson playing throughout with proportions - tightening, deflating and exaggerating.

Like a slim moss green dress, fronted by a back-to-front men’s blazer. It shouldn’t really have worked, but it did, so well. While other beige or egg shell blue silk dresses looked like they were draped upwards, rising to a series of peaks at the neckline.  

Anderson will always love an outrageous shoe, and this season he made several in hundreds of deflated balloons, like rubberised mops.

He kept repeating variations of his ideas with slight changes throughout the show, in an almost meditative process, playing playfully with silhouettes.

Every so often a glitch, like the print made up of squares, as if a video screen had frozen. And some marvellous reduced Barbour-style waxed raincoats cut like mini A-Line coats and a series of micro shearling bombers that screamed 'must have!'

Anderson’s ability to balance craft, creativity and commerce never ceases to impress. Under his guidance, Loewe has grown almost four fold in revenues, which are expected to break one billion euros in 2022. 

Plus, this collection felt like a huge hot artistic hit from the very first passage, ushered in by huge piano chords.

“I had a vision of Taylor Russell opening the show. She’s a really good friend of mine. This precision in someone who already seems the future of acting or performance. I like the idea, how do you make austere positive? And she did this and set the right tone,” concluded Anderson, the most fertile imagination in fashion today.Victoria Beckham: Graceful in Val-de-GrâceThe hottest ticket in Paris this Friday was to see Victoria Beckham, to witness the British designer making her Paris debut with a graceful collection inside a cloisters at Val-de-Grâce.Besides her family - including hubby David, eldest son and daughter-in-law, Nicola Peltz - two of the hottest designers in France sat front row - Simon Porte Jacquemus and Nicolas Di Felice of Courreges.

Any Anglo-Saxon taking a collection to Paris always runs a risk. French and continental critics can be unforgiving. But, this turned out to be a triumph for Beckham, with a collection made with her finest fabrics to date, updated tailoring and impeccable draping.

Little wonder, after several tricky years of restructuring, the house is poised to return to the black. This collection will make that happen more rapidly. 

“It’s been a dream for such a long time to show in Paris, and the fact that we are really here is amazing. And I told myself, I’m an independent brand and I always get nervous before shows, but I’m really going to enjoy every single moment!” enthused Beckham, in a pre-show preview.

Beckham spent a decade showing in Manhattan, before decamping to London four years ago. Generally staging tight shows inside relatively intimate settings on both sides of the pond, from the Public Library on Fifth Avenue to a Regency ballroom in Whitehall.

In the Paris cloisters, stands outs in tailoring included a really cool biker jacket with embossed spiky lapels; or a classy soft pink blazer with embossed peak lapels. Even a simple stretch mesh semi sheer blazer had tremendous élan.

Beckham took plenty of risks with her tailoring; in particular a mannish black linen blazer, made with an open back held together with just a cross strap. But they all paid off.

Yet, the heart of the matter was her slim-line dresses, artfully draped or ruched or bias cut and made in linen, chiffon or organza shell prints at the finale. Plus, Victoria added a risqué touch with monogram lace leggings and tights. 

Being true to herself, with a silhouette that recalled her earliest days showing in intimate presentations for barely a dozen people within an Upper East Side townhouse in New York. Though elevating her ideas for Paris with more advanced techniques, like adding tassels, which were also used in a series of new bags.

Beckham, whose first shows in NYC used obscure but sharply models, also splashed out on her casting, in a cabinet des mannequins that included Gigi and Bella Hadid, and opened and closed with Rianne van Rompaey.

Inside sources are predicting that revenues will reach £60 million this year, with a booming beauty business accounting for half.

Aided by this impressive French debut. After almost 15 years of runway shows, this collection must rate as one of Victoria’s three best-ever.Schiaparelli: Homage paid to its ready-to-wearLe tout Paris took themselves to Place Vendome on Thursday afternoon to witness the Spring/Summer 2023 ready-to-wear collection of Schiaparelli.Kylie Jenner came to pay homage, as did Chiara Ferragni, to Daniel Roseberry and his latest body parts driven display. Staged inside the Hotel d'Evreux, where hundreds of fans and street photographers had gathered in the rain outside. 

Bold graphic cutouts greeted one entering, from which hung scores of hand bags bedecked with golden metal ears, eyes, mouths and noses. The same parts that appeared on ravishingly well-cut bias cut silk dresses. 

Just a trio of live models wandered around the opulent salons, one in a beautifully cut blazer, finished with nine golden and pearl buttons. While Roseberry revived Elsa’s iconic cello dress, updated with another series of golden buttons. Even making one version in denim.

For rock goddess after parties there was a faded blue denim jacket emblazoned on the back with a gold Aztec sun. For truly surreal moments, a hand-painted golden torso on top of a black leotard.

“I call it pret-a-couture,” explained the patron Diego della Valle, at the presentation.
 Yohji Yamamoto: Poetry in city hallA poetic moment and a salutary lesson in draping by Yohji Yamamoto, almost completely composed in black and white.A brilliantly jumbled up meeting of historicism, femme-fatale fancies and askew corsetry pulled together by Yamamoto’s skills.

Presented underneath a huge ceiling fresco, whose heroines being saved from angry gods oddly echoed the collection on the runway. Except many of Yamamoto’s gals wore leggings and fab new sneakers.

“I wanted to blend 17th-and 18th-century costumes with today’s streetwear to make a new modernity,” explained Yamamoto, before receiving praise from Tyga.

The busiest fashion fan in Paris this week, Tyga has been showing up at multiple shows including Rick Owens.

As the show progressed, the Japanese designer added in great gilded architectural prints and Japanese script. A meeting of east and west that continued on the sound track. It again featured Yohji, ramping up huge chords on a steel guitar as he sang a Japanese version of Lou Reed’s 'Take a Walk on the Wild Side'.

Which this show felt like, the latest expression of Yamamoto’s poetic style, and an unmissable collection for true aficionados.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 1, 2022","There seems to be a new brand launching daily, but one thing these startups are missing: heritage. A years-long or even a centuries-long legacy is relegated to a few luxury accessories brands whose craft and innovation have stood the test of time. Two brands, Roger Vivier and Delvaux, presented their latest collections in Paris with presentations punctuating that their quality and design live eternally.

Roger Vivier took a more cerebral approach to its event this season, steering away from the frivolity of Hotel Vivier for a more studied look at what goes into their elaborate shoes and bags. Led by creative director Gherardo Felloni, the Tod's Group-owned French label took over the Fondation Simone and Cino Del Duca and turned it into a visual and physical study of the house codes, referring to itself as La Maison Vivier. While meant to teach, it was anything but institutional. As Felloni said in an interview, ""it was time for the house to do the talking.""With the multimedia experience, installations, artisans, and live performers, it was more than just informational. Guests were greeted by a giant wooden shoe, referencing one the shoe designer made for an exhibit at a 1987 retrospective at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. The event showcased six design concepts the house is known for; 'King of the Heel', 'Belle Vivier', 'I Love Vivier', 'Collages', 'Virgule', 'Embroideries', and 'Jewel heel'.

As attendees journeyed from room to room, they discovered artisans at work in each, demonstrating techniques that define Roger Vivier shoes, such as embroiderers, leather cutters, and crystal setters.The creative director told FashionNetwork.com that this season was even more homage to the archives.

""This season, I focused on the icons of the house and the savoir-faire and craftsmanship,"" he said, explaining the presentation concept. ""I showed a craftsperson once before, and people were really fascinated, so you will see in each room artisans demonstrating how the shoes and bags are made,"" he added.

A focus this season is a satin bow, something Felloni also said was in the treasure trove archives.

""I see this beautiful bow every time I go to the archives. Roger Vivier was among the first to take bows and flowers from hats and put them on shoes.,"" he explained.

In this sense, the key shoe of the season, the 'Virgule Flowers Bow Slingback', encompasses many house codes; the curved comma heel, the embroidered paillettes and gemstone flowers, the bow, and the use of vibrant color. The 'Viv' Choc Flowers' with its embroidered strass coordinate nicely.  
Don't be fooled by the adornments. According to the designer, these beauties are intended to be worn in the daytime. ""It's never too much! I believe in freedom; if you want to wake up and wear a Virgule kitten heel or Choc heel with a pair of jeans, why not? 

Delvaux, the Belgian luxury house founded in 1829, also looked to its heritage to explore how the design remains relevant and transformative each season. The brand, currently led by former president Jean-Marc Loubier transformed a townhouse on the tony Boulevard de Latour-Maubourg into a ""Villégiature,"" or what the Belgians refer to as a summer getaway. The presence of the new owner Richemont was evidenced in the elaborate event.Lifesize sandcastles and colorful leather windmills served as a backdrop for the house to display its seasonal focus, which includes classic bag styles interpreted in new ways. Among the messages were the new colorful versions of the 1967 'Tempête' as a tote, clutch, and a new pochette style.

The clutch shape inspired Delvaux's debut styles: the 'Lingot' with elongated D-shaped hardware and the 'Leonce' inspired by an archive style in the seventies.

The 'Pin' bag, influenced by a feedbag for horses, was celebrating fifty years and got a new look to mark the occasion, transforming into a mini wristlet clutch and new 'Pin' toy size, just big enough for a phone, keys, cards, and lipstick. Interestingly, the bags offer an entry price point of $2,000. Though Loubier insists it isn't the point.

""It's about the different parts of a women's day and how she lives. The client can own everything we do and crave what we do in different sizes and materials,"" said Loubier.

While the styles respect the label's legacy, so do the details that highlight the craftsmanship. New D-leather tab details and colorful leather pom poms that require twenty minutes to assemble just one and wicker from France's Loire valley demonstrate the craft that goes into each Delvaux bag.

""There is a lot of craft; it's ours, and we apply them to existing bag shapes because without those, they are not as interesting,"" Loubier explained, adding, ""A Delvaux bag lasts generations. We play with novelty around what we are known for; you recognize the shape, but the leathers, finishes, sizes, colors, etc. change.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 1, 2022","In Milan as in Paris, the runways continue to put forward rather skimpy and sexy outfits for next summer. Transparencies, impalpable materials, ultra short clothes, and visible underwear define the new silhouette for spring-summer 2023. Just like Isabel Marant and Ludovic de Saint Sernin, who presented their collections on Thursday in the French capital.
 As always, the crowd hurried to Place Colette to witness the last show of the evening that took place in the gardens of the Palais Royal. The Isabel Marant show is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated of Paris Fashion Week. Thursday evening especially with Bella and Gigi Hadid walking the runway.

The designer took us south towards high temperatures with very short outfits including mini-skirts, tiny shorts and micro-dresses. The collection featured very wide armholes highlighting bare shoulders. Belly and navel also play the stars revealing themselves in looks a little more sporty and nonchalant composed of low-waist cargo pants and bra.A vaguely exotic and oriental atmosphere emerges from the collection with a series of pieces with Berber influences, decorated with silver sequins and embroidery, cut in floral prints, or crossed with golden highlights. Ruffled dresses, fine bodices adorned with trimmings, a bolero sparkling with sequins, everything seems to vibrate in the heat.

Crochet one-piece swimsuits and beaded tank tops complete the women's summer wardrobe, while men take an even more casual approach with beautiful loose knit and crochet pieces. 
As he celebrates his brand’s fifth anniversary, Ludovic de Saint Sernin continued with an erotic vibe, dressing men and women in exactly the same way without distinction of gender. He reinforced his statement with a series of increasingly sophisticated sexy models, while enriching his wardrobe with more consistent and commercial pieces.

For next summer, men are taking on a sensual, virile, Roman legionary-like style, while women are showing off their very revealing outfits. Laced-up, high leather boots with no heel and banded skirts topped with a studded belt are the basis of the uniform. The centurion skirt is also declined in studded and fringed leather briefs, or in flared strapless tops with big pleats, also made in a minidress version. The skirt also comes in khaki canvas.

A scarlet anthurium with its yellow pistil, on a one-shoulder top or hanging on the wrist as a bracelet, attracted attention. The collection included uber-tight leather pieces such as a bustier, shorts, tank tops, pants as well as tulle veil draping over the body and fine knits.

For the evening, men put on fully laced pants, revealing the roundness of their buttocks, while women adorned themselves with glittering Swarovski crystal mesh ensembles, dresses or draped miniskirts matching the bra.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 30, 2022","With London Fashion Week’s celebratory angle having been on hold due to the death of the Queen in September, the British Fashion Council has now unveiled a “city-wide celebration” that’s set to kick off on 6 October and run until 13 October.The curated programme will include “unique experiences, events and promotions” and “will celebrate creativity in London”.

"Sep 29, 2022","Three designers with powerful, yet highly diverse vistas staged striking shows in Paris, testifying to the energy of the city as fashion’s highest plateau.  FashionNetwork.com witnessed Chloé by Gabriela Hearst; Rick Owens and Acne Studios by Jonny Johansson.  Chloé: Parisian panacheOne test of a truly talented designer is the ability to separate their own brand’s aesthetic from that of their evening work, an exam accomplished with great skill on Thursday in Paris by Gabriela Hearst.If her signature marque is a clever blend of Latin American earthiness and urban modernity, her collection for Chloé today sizzled with Parisian panache and chic.

Presented in very darkened Pavilion Vendome, close to the Ritz, the show opened with an arty flourish of search-light beams and hanging LED hoola-hoops to create a naughty nocturnal mood.

Kicking off with a series of cut-out columns in Aran white or black knits that had great gall. And sending out Gigi Hadid in a silver chain-mail knit party frock that spelled trouble. The cast’ hair loosely jelled back, in a Valkyrie-at-an-after-party attitude. 

Gabriela is also a designer who understands how to use leather - with terrific flared rawhide pants, their side trimmed with Groucho grommets, or very elegant deerskin dresses with exaggerated batwing sleeves. Hearst is also no slouch when it comes to accessories, either for editorial panache, like her tie-up woven sacks, that looked like gigantic knots or for commerce - like her great seaside stripe totes. While the new Chloé footwear from studded sandals with thick soles to silver platforms with tubular straps will be sure-fire hits.

Chloé, which is owned by the giant Swiss-based luxury group Richemont, had had a topsy-turvy run in the previous few years, but under Hearst it has again found direction and momentum.Rick Owens: Theda Bara epic One day surely they will build a monument to Rick Owens, so monumental are his shows, so exotic his vision and so wide-ranging his interpretation of fashion and history.

Like the previous season, Ancient Egypt was again the well-spring of Owens's collection, after the California-born designer had spent weeks in the Valley of the Kings considering its massive pyramids. 

He even named the collection Edfu, after a temple on the West bank of the river Nile. His journey led to him musing on his childhood opinion of Egypt, based on Cecil B. DeMille’s biblical epics and images of Theda Bara, the first sex symbol of the cinema and the silent-era star of Cleopatra. Though Fox Studio publicity claimed she was born in Egypt, Bara was actually born in Cincinnati.

“These movies became my aesthetic recipe - ancient stories about faith and high purpose mixed with a camp and lurid exoticism seen through a turn of the century black and white Art Nouveau filter. With a doss of self-invention - Theda’s pierce and powerful and frankly artificial self that understood and acknowledged the light and darkness of real life,”  explained Owens, whose show set was a catwalk over the waters of the 1930s Modernist fountain of the Palais de Tokyo.

Like Bara, whose nickname was The Vamp, many of the cast wore revealing costumes.  Amazing translucent leather gowns that emerged out of the dry ice swirling around his catwalk, itself dampened by a 20-meter high vertical spray of water at the fountain’s centre.

Others wafted by in remarkable car-crash sculpture-worthy metallic leathers, scrunched into bat wings and bell sleeves. 

His silhouette was ethereal, elongated and often finished with pagoda shoulders. Though the standout moment was a pair of ginormous crinolines made of recycled tulle.  All applauded at length in an audience that included Cher, Tyga and Machine Gun Kelly.

In effect, one could not helping thinking that the whole collection cried out to be costumes a new DeMille film. When one suddenly realised that is who Owens is. The Demille de la mode; an epic designer who one day will get the recognition of the general public that he has in the fashion community today. 

Practically all of Bara’s movies were lost in a 1937 fire in Fox’s vaults. One prays that footage of Owens's shows is never lost, and that a few thousand years from now, another young man from a small rural town will be inspired to invent a new visual universe, as Rick has done.     Acne Studios: Birthday bash in the Palais de TokyoIs there a more underrated designer in fashion than Jonny Johansson, the creative director of Acne Studios? A brand that celebrated its 10th anniversary Wednesday night in a gala show, where the presence of Kylie Jenner sent the paparazzi into a feeding frenzy.

Everyone who was everyone in fashion turned up for the birthday, taking their places on pink satin boudoir-like beds, as waiters in white smocks, shorts, golden knee socks and clogs served bitter orange cocktails or bubbly.

Kylie added to the intoxicated mood, arriving in a taut white column, and melodramatically putting on white Acne retro shades as a score of photographers and three times as many mobile phone-wielding influencers blatantly scrambled for a social media video.

Though the crux of the collection was transparency. Seen in some rather beautiful dresses, beneath which one spotted carefully placed feathers, ribbons, fabric swatches and, bien sur, underwear.

Gauze and mesh were wrapped around half the collection; though juxtaposed with the bags, most of which were finished with punky spikes. Many looking more like weapons than totes. 

Some great battered metallic leather coats or jeans also had the spikes running down the arms and legs - not ideal subway or metro wear.  In a co-ed show, guys marched in brothel creepers with upturned metal spikes, like angry sharks. Though Jonny’s zaniest idea was attaching matching fabric skin guards to scores of high heels, made in floral satins and silks.

Add in a sense of savvy humour, like Jonny’s sextet of gingham table-cloth looks, craftily cut into giant boyfriend jackets; fabric boobs, rosettes, leggings and even wedges with bows.

This was a fine celebration of a decade of great design. It all made for a happy fete, and lots of great rock-star ideas, but maybe too many, too often. It was almost as if Johansson felt condemned to be uber-creative.

Sometimes designers should rest on their laurels.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 29, 2022","The Vegan Fashion Week in Los Angeles is set to take place from Oct. 10-12, in partnership with Ukrainian Fashion Week. FashionNetwork.com sat down with founder Emmanuelle Rienda, to discuss impact of the event, now in its fourth edition.FashionNetwork.com: The fourth edition of the Vegan Fashion Week in Los Angeles will be held in partnership with the Ukrainian Fashion Week. What were the intentions for this partnership?
  
Emmanuelle Rienda: The relationship with Ukrainian Fashion Week happened very organically. I approached them to offer my support after being affected by the war. Today, Vegan Fashion Week is recognized as an important moment in the fashion calendar. More than just clothes on the runway, it has become a hotspot for messages that matter, inspiring an international audience of industry professionals, politics and consumers to do better. For these reasons, Ukrainian Fashion Week accepted my invitation. 
 
FNW: What is the state of fashion and fashion designers in Ukraine today? ER: Some Ukrainian fashion designers were forced to flee their own country, some of them stayed, but most of them lost their business or are on the verge of catastrophic financial losses. They very much need international support from the fashion community to keep their creativity and livelihood alive and need a long-term physical showroom for their collections to continue to exist and be showcased to industry professionals outside of Ukraine. Long-term press & sales support is the compulsory heartbeat of a brand to continue existing throughout the war. This year’s benefits will support Ukrainian Designers via the VFW Mentorship Fund, which provides continued support for emerging fashion designers. 
 
FNW: Does vegan fashion in Ukraine have a particular developments of note today?
 
ER: There is a real shift and conscious efforts to develop long-term sustainability efforts in Ukraine despite the war, both in the fashion industry and at a societal level. Veganism is an important lifestyle that even made the headlines in top Ukrainian media (with an article entitled) “How vegans make the army more inclusive,” by providing vegan rations to plant-based soldiers. Among the Ukrainians required to stay and fight in the war against Russia rather than evacuate, many vegans are among the soldiers to be drafted. Since then, vegan organization Every Animal has been tirelessly working to care for them. 
 
FNW: How many Ukrainian designers will be on the catwalk on October 10? Who will we be able to discover?
 
ER: We curated a lineup of 12 sustainable Ukrainian designers in collaboration with Ukrainian Fashion Week. Designers to be showcased on the runway include: Chereshnivska, Dzhus, Gorohova, Ochis, Oversized, RCR Khomenko, Roussin, Sheezen, and more to be announced. Even though some brands are not labeled vegan, all the looks selected to be presented at Vegan Fashion Week are cruelty-free, and sustainable.FNW: Will the Ukrainian community of Los Angeles be there?
 
ER: We are receiving strong support from the Ukrainian community in Los Angeles. Mika Newton, the Ukrainian celebrity who recently shared the stage with Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky & John Legend at the Grammys, will be joining us as a guest of honor. Ukrainian makeup artist Vlada Haggerty, born and raised in Kiev, is joining us as our Key Lip Artist for the fashion show and Ukrainian models will walk the runway to represent their country.
  
FNW: Are other non-Ukrainian brands also included in the program?
 
ER: This year, we are expanding Vegan World™ –the only cruelty-free and sustainable fashion trade show– by presenting a curation of international designers embodying the values of our movement. Industry professionals, press, buyers, investors and fashion lovers will be able to discover cruelty-free beauty with Artís, KVD Beauty, MOB Beauty, SoloVegan and vegan fashion, footwear and accessories with Bohema, Fan All Flames, Natalia Fedner, Nous Étudions, R99, Sentient, Sylven New York, Shoes 53045, Veganologie, Wildling Shoes, Willa Phoenix, Vegan Tiger and more to be announced.
 
FNW: Conferences will also be offered on the sidelines of the fashion shows. What subjects will you address?
 
ER: Vegan Fashion Week is a global movement pushing meaningful conversations for the future of our planet. We put together a series of panel discussions by inviting experts to discuss digital fashion, Web3 & DAOs, vegan & clean beauty, sustainability & ethics, intersectionality and social impact. We are also opening Vegan Fashion Week on an important date, Columbus Day, that is now celebrated as Indegenous Peoples’ Day – a holiday meant to honor the culture and history of the people living in the Americas both before and after Columbus’ arrival. It’s an eloquent parallel with the modern colonialism Ukraine is experiencing in the hands of Russia.
 
FNW: Generally speaking, how has the state of vegan fashion been over the past few years?
 
ER: When I started Vegan Fashion Week in 2018, the conversation around sustainability in fashion was just starting and leaders in this emerging space were still actively promoting the use of animal-derived materials (leather, wool, silk…) as being “sustainable”. Short answer: it’s not. For example, leather production is catastrophic in terms of animal cruelty, deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. A lot of people argue that leather is biodegradable so it’s better for the environment, but that is entirely the tanning process that makes most of today's leather production unable to degrade.FNW: How did Vegan Fashion Week grow?
 
ER: With no marketing budget, Vegan Fashion Week created an organic media impact of more than 50 million dollars in media value, made headlines on all continents and was featured in more than 3000 articles. By skyrocketing our mission in top media, we created a cultural shift changing the narrative around vegan fashion. Today we can see top fashion houses moving towards plant-based alternatives such as Gucci, Salvatore Ferragamo, Karl Lagerfeld, Hermès, and more... Vegan Fashion Week is not about being perfect, it’s about inspiring change and creating an ecosystem around values that are truly impactful for humans and non-humans. 
 
FNW: Are there any other projects coming up?

ER: I am working on launching the first vegan, ethical and sustainable product certification to inform and protect consumers and I am continuing to advocate with the Mayor’s office to solidify Los Angeles as the Ethical Fashion Capital in the world. My efforts coincide with the California fur ban, a legislation that as of January 1, 2023 will make it unlawful to manufacture and sell fur; one of the strongest animal rights laws in U.S. history.
 
FNW: You also founded the Vegan Fashion Library in Los Angeles, a showroom dedicated to product placement, influencer strategies and public relations. Have you seen more attention from talent and the media in Los Angeles?
 
ER: It’s a strategic move on my part to have launched the first completely cruelty-free, vegan and sustainable showroom in 2020 (during the pandemic) to seduce an important demographic of the entertainment industry. To this date, we have provided vegan clothes for celebrities including Billie Eilish, Gwen Stefani, Mya, Olivia Rodrigo, Jay Shetty, Sofia Reyes… and the list goes on! I am also working on introducing our portfolio of designers by curating concepts such as “Ad Infinitum”, the first vegan and sustainable fashion activation in collaboration with Informa Markets, PROJECT’s curated space that celebrates the importance of – and the continued pursuit for – circularity, environmental responsibility, and sustainable practices within the fashion industry.
 
FNW: How does such a structure work today to be profitable?
 
ER: I invested my life savings in Vegan Fashion Week. To this day, it’s still a personal investment in addition to a community effort to produce this platform. In order to take the movement to the next level, I am looking to surround myself with a skilled team, a board of advisors, philanthropic donors and politics.

"Sep 28, 2022","Puma has launched We Are Legends, a platform led by a collective of the sport brand’s black designers, with which Puma wants to celebrate ""the Black community and its creatives.” The new storytelling and product development platform will drop a first apparel collection in early October.With this initiative, Puma is keen to boost black representation within the design industry. We Are Legends is driven by an internal collective of Black designers and, as its name suggests, it aims to celebrate the present in black culture, and not just the richness of its past history, as Puma explained.

“Often when we celebrate Black culture, we look to the past. However, our collective wanted to help change this narrative by empowering people to speak up in their most authentic voices now, to create their own legacy that will be legendary,” said Ariel Weeks, footwear merchandising manager and head of Puma’s B-Bold employee resource group.According to Puma, the platform's goal is not only to tell authentic stories and highlight the beauty of cultural diversity, but also to promote the next generation of black designers. To achieve this, Puma wants to raise awareness of the importance of black culture and provide access to roles in the industry by means of strategic partnerships, mentorship, and education.

Michelle Marshall, head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Puma North America, said: “I am extremely proud to introduce the world to We Are Legends, a collective of black designers who are a prime example of when [sic] employees step up to drive and be the change that they want to see.”

‘The Yard’, the first collection by We Are Legends, is inspired by ‘Homecoming’ - a tradition in many high schools and colleges in the U.S, as they welcome back and celebrate former alumni.

The collection features men's and women's clothes in a bright palette of brown, purple and orange hues. Classic Puma items, like the suede sneakers, have been reinterpreted in a contemporary shape and style.

“Design details reference styles worn by HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] students in the past and currently, capturing the culture’s deep history and honouring their contribution to American style,” said Puma.

‘The Yard’ will be launched on October 1 worldwide on the Puma app and at the brand’s New York flagship. On October 3, the collection will be available on Puma’s e-shop and at selected retailers around the world.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 28, 2022","A breath of fresh air invaded the catwalks of Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday, with rich and inventive collections designed by young brands that have gained in visibility in recent years. Victoria/Tomas, Botter and Mame Kurogouchi are still going strong, despite two difficult years marked by the pandemic, consolidating their place in an increasingly crowded fashion market.A symbolic step was taken by Victoria Feldman and Tomas Berzins, who celebrated the tenth anniversary of their house Victoria/Tomas on Tuesday. The two designers, she from Russia and he from Latvia, met on the benches of the Esmod school in Paris, and since then have never left each other, launching their brand in September 2012. It is this love story that they wanted to tell, on Tuesday, through an energetic and very sexy spring-summer 2023 collection.

The show opened with Victoria in a virginal white crinkled nylon minidress, perched on the brand's iconic lace-up boots, with her six-month-old baby in her arms. ""This opening with me in all white and our son seemed like a beautiful symbol to show the beginning of something new. We wanted to share a real, sincere and authentic story with the public,"" the designer confided to FashionNetwork.com backstage, recalling that the brand is distributed in more than 50 multi-brand boutiques and for the past two seasons via a showroom in China.This ""decade of love"", as the collection is called, is symbolized by the heart, which can be found everywhere, in patterns, logos, badges and embroidery. Fabric hearts are applied in concentric layers to the pockets of Saharan shirts and jackets. They are outlined by means of metallic rings applied to T-shirts and sweaters, but also on knee-length trousers or inlaid on the breasts of minidresses and strapless tops.

Most pieces are reversible. This anniversary collection hardly lacks fringed skirts and striped cotton shirts, which this season are shortened in the front and left long and loose in the back. The belly is easily exposed with sweatshirts and cropped shirts. The wardrobe is particularly sensual with transparent black fishnet, lace bodysuits and lingerie that can be worn under a jacket, the result of a collaboration with the new high-end corsetry line Chantelle X.Another love story was being told on the Parisian catwalks the very same day. That of Lisi Herrebrugh and Rushemy Botter. Freshly awarded the Andam prize, the two designers, who left the creative direction of Nina Ricci at the beginning of the year, refocused on their Botter brand and menswear, showing more than ever their commitment to save the oceans and preserve the coral reef. Models dipped their hands into amazing water-filled latex aquarium mittens, wore sneakers with large coloured rubber soles, while bags were shaped like ice cubes or diving buoys.
 
With this spring-summer 2023 collection, the Dutch duo, whose origins are divided between Curaçao island and Santo Domingo island, took the suit, a strong piece of their wardrobe, and reworked it in depth to modernize it with a twist, making it cool and desirable. The cuts are clean, while keeping the volumes comfortable and fluid. The suits are available in classic gray shades or micro-check patterns and even Caribbean turquoise, the brand's signature color. Everything is about detail and construction. The jackets, in particular, are subtly revisited, without sleeves, or shortened and flared, or enhanced in the back.

The front is split, with one flap sometimes coming off to fall over the chest like a petal. Slits on the shoulders allow the sleeves of the jacket to be removed by throwing them back, a bit like how some surfers wear their wetsuits when getting out of the water. To accentuate the diver's look, the jacket can be tucked into the trousers, worn with its double - a second tone-on-tone jacket - in a twin-set fashion. It can also be unbuttoned in the middle and opened in the shape of a heart. In the same spirit, the cardigan and the knitted dress are worn as a tight bustier, with the sleeves folded back and tied around the neck as a scarf.

 In a delicate collection in mint and chocolate colors, Mame Kurogouchi highlighted Japanese know-how, as always. This season, designer Maiko Kurogouchi was inspired by an ancestral technique of weaving bamboo baskets. She uses the clever rosettes and scrolls in tops and dresses woven from shoe laces or in macramé tunics decorated with bamboo beads to slip over a knitted leotard. But also in tops woven with ribbons.

The play of braiding is repeated in elaborate knitwear, with raised stitches that create textured effects. The wardrobe also offers impalpable silk dresses, finely pleated like origami. Others, with deep necklines, are layered with a skin-tight knit in the same tone or show a chic bra. Wearing Zori, the traditional Japanese sandals, the models moved gracefully with mint green lips, matching some of their minimalist suits, such as graphic trousers, dress, jacket and coat in the same fresh shade.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 28, 2022","Paris Fashion Week is all about checking on the status of independent designers, like Christelle Kocher at Koché, Emeric Tchatchoua at 3.Paradis and Jun Takahashi at Undercover. Even if the one great show of the past 24 hours was by Nicolas Di Felice for Courrèges, owned by a wing of the Pinault family luxury empire.Courrèges: Forward to the future Rain, then sand, fell in abundance at Courrèges on Wednesday in a subtle change of gears and a subtle show by Nicolas Di Felice for the house.

Moving away from the house’s familiar codes of AC logo, synthetic fake leather, vinyl and retro futurism, Di Felice debuted his show in all-white oversized men’s shirts cut into dresses, barely there cocktails and spiky gilets over flared jeans.Held inside an all-white north Paris sound stage, the entire cast walking around a 10-meter diameter centre circle of sand. Many of them bare foot, or even carrying their sling backs or sculpted booties in their hands.

A good third of the cast wore jackets slung over the shoulders, held on by interior straps. Bella Hadid even wore her speckled denim jacket tied around her hips.

Above all the detailing was excellent: silver metallic mittens, skirts finished with dangling fabric clasps, a great series of flared trousers completed with inside leg studs or multiple grommets. And voluminous jackets with the oversized pockets favoured by founder André Courrèges, who founded his house back in 1961.

What made this collection so great was that it managed to look hyper modern and very Courrèges without falling back into a clichéd use of the brand’s DNA. Plus, much of the clothing is now made in far more eco-friendly vinyl of recycled bio-based polyurethane.

No wonder the popular Di Felice won himself a huge minute of applause, as scores of editors headed backstage to congratulate him. Led by a beaming Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of luxury giant Kering. His family’s investment vehicle Artemis acquired 100% of Courrèges in 2018. 

After today’s highly impressive display by Nicholas Di Felice, that looks to be a very good deal.3.Paradis: Poetry and pastryOne brand that is very much an expression of cool insider is 3.Paradis, a Quebec-born label founded by Emeric Tchatchoua that makes street wear of almost couture elegance. Launched in 2013 as a menswear label, this season marked its first women’s collection.

A blend of Japanese streetwear, Parisian chic and African iconography, 3.Paradis found a suitably eclectic location for its show. Inside the Avenue de l’Opera flagship café of Cedric Grommet, the superstar French pastry maker, known for airbrushing chocolate to replicate the textures of fruits and vegetables.

Staged en petit comité, as the French like to say, before a select audience of barely 40, each served small plates, including what looked like a carrot and spinach pie that was actually delicious pastry.  

Underling Tchatchoua’s poetic approach, practically every look featured a dove. Either as lace trim of layered flamenco skirts or printed flying over cutaway skirts, or soaring over black or beige mannish black trench-coats and even as macramé in skimpy summer frocks. 

One real living dove even fluttered on the hand of a model, in turn dressed in a dove pattern lace gown.

In a co-ed show, Emeric dressed his guys in similar lace jeans and jean jackets and also with red carpet winner egg shell blue dove print tuxedos.

“Harmonious unity and collective hope, a paradis was born representative of a safe haven to discuss all of these notions,” recalled the designer in his program.

“Our intention has always been to design from an explorative place, using the world around us as inspiration. When I look outwardly, women are a reflection of life, women deserve paradis,” added Tchatchoua.Koché: Hoodies dreaming of beautiful sunsetsA meeting of technology and fashion at Koché this season, as designer Christelle Kocher collaborated with Google in her latest collection.

A meeting of garments too, as looks interacted with each other, switching on LEDs woven into the garment, as boy and girl met each other. One in sweatshirt the other in feathered mini.

Staged inside the former stock market of Paris, which was dissected by a huge screen, which in turn dialogued with looks in this show. On the screen, an invisible hand which wrote: “Do hoodies dream of beautiful sunsets?” A thought that then appeared on a horizontal screen perched on top of a white sweatshirt with the dual logo, Koché Google.

“A dialogue with science, and how technology can connect us. Not an obvious vision with futuristic clothes. I did not want to connect in the virtual world, but to connect in reality. Using Google technology that we wove into the garments and then radar that made the clothes react with the passage of the models,” explained Kocher post show.

In her evening job at Chanel, she helps handle three departments - feathers, embroidered flowers and plissé fabrics. And in an ultimate compliment, Chanel’s creative director Virginie Viard came to admire this collection.

Blending street style with an urban feel to couture, using mixes of vegan leather and denim. All the while playing with draping to make a silhouette that was quite soft.Undercover: Down Abbey in Uptown ParisHints of country houses and gentle 1920s balls whispered through the latest collection from Undercover, designer Jun Takahashi's most ladylike to date.

Staged inside the American Cathedral on posh Avenue George V, this was a gentile display from a revolutionary designer, and a surprising change of pace from Takahashi.

Prim tuxedo shirts with pearl studs worn over mannish multi-pleat safari pants, or a gents’ waistcoat was finished with just one shoulder.

Thought it being Undercover, the essential image was the defiantly deconstructed tailoring. Hence, beautifully cut sherbet lemon or pale gray pant suits were slashed half a dozen times, and the holes trimmed in gauze.   

His cast made up with chignon that mysteriously were fronted by two small horns of stiff hair. While many models were made up with fake tears, as if a suitor had thrown them over for a wealthier bride at a hunt ball. Melodrama in the nave.

Before the whole shebang went into overdrive with four bouffant emu-shaped ball gowns in dense red chiffon; lime or power blue metallic silk; or, for the final look, tattered beige with fabric daffodils attached.

Perhaps not the greatest ever collection by Takahashi, but an elegant expression nonetheless.

FashionNetwork.com: The history of LA Fashion Week has seen many twists and turns, what are your ambitions with this new edition?
 
Ciarra Pardo: Considering the cultural boom happening right now in LA, we really wanted to create a space that allows for this creativity to flourish, in a limitless and daring environment. The expressive and diverse nature of Los Angeles has led us to offer an opportunity where the brand or designer can realize their creative universe in all verticals, constructing a playground with endless opportunities, with an emphasis on how Tech, Fashion and Beauty intersect. FNW : For the first time, LAFW will be registered on the CFDA calendar, does this mark an important step in the credibility of LA FW?
 
CP: Of course, for us, it has always been really important to become a relevant and competitive fashion player in the industry and we are really grateful for the support of Steven Kolb, CFDA CEO, during this process. Considering our shared collective visions for sustainability and inclusivity as core values in LAFW, it is ever more rewarding that this will be observed and appreciated on an official level. We also hope that this cohesive fashion festival experience can expand, allowing creatives to combine different industries with the aim of innovation in fashion, thus this visibility is hugely exciting.
 
FNW : Your tagline is mixing fashion, beauty, tech, sustainability, why this positioning?
 
CP: In such a fast developing world, in which Tech dictates so much of what we do, from the gaming industry to basic communication, to manufacturing garments and tracking carbon footprint, a world where we don't utilize these intersections in fashion, does not exist. With this comes the ways in which Beauty and Fashion can be enhanced by Tech, innovating new experiences for the future of sustainable fashion and technology.
 
FNW: Levis and Guess will be part of the program, what can we expect ?
 
CP: We will be celebrating with Guess, they have a special presentation in store for us! Levi’s are also presenting us with a sustainably focussed private event, reminding us of the importance of being mindful and responsible when consuming fashion.
 
FNW: How many shows are on the program ?
 
CP: We are currently keeping it at a conservative 10 shows on the program, with Maxwell Osborne's An Only Child opening the event. Alongside a host of different panels, masterclasses, our gifting suite, curated pop-ups, and beauty collaborations. We are excited for this teaser, and lots more to come!
 
FNW: Among the young emerging designers, who can we discover?
 
CP: Sami Miro Vintage, an LA homegrown brand will be showing, and Chris Nick is another interesting designer to keep an eye on. An Only Child, an emerging brand will be debuting its new collection with a fully immersive experience, digital mapping and 3D simulation. 
 
FNW: What kind of audience are you targeting? 
 
CP: We really want to attract the younger crowd, Gen Z creatives, through our focus on tech platforms, like TikTok, Snapchat and Ray-Ban stories, amongst the 300-400 guests. That being said, we are also very keen on the use of these platforms with real-time content to make our event inclusive to all the people around the world that cannot attend. Diversity has also been key for us since the beginning, so with the host of followers from Gypsy Sport during Latin X month, and the LAFW Launch of An Only Child, we hope to see some new faces amongst the frequent fashion crowd.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 27, 2022","After the Milanese week, the fashion marathon continues in Paris after a short stopover in London for the Burberry show. On Monday's opening night, creativity was unleashed with Victor Weinsanto and Alphonse Maîtrepierre’s unbridled shows, two promising new names, who freely revisit the codes of couture.Coincidentally, both of them have been honored by Jean Paul Gaultier, with whom they studied. Elements of the ""enfant terrible de la mode"" could notably be perceived in the two collections. Like Weinsanto's signature corset, which he reworked into strapless mini dresses in cotton or satin, laced up at the front and back. We also noted some accessories that both collections had in common, such as these glamorous transparent tulle gloves.

With his flair for the stage, Victor Weinsanto put on a true show. In the premises of Dover Street Market’s creative hub at number 35-37 the designer welcomed to his podium fellow stylists, LGBT performers and other entertainers from the parisien nightlife scene. Drag queens Paloma and ""La Grande Dame'', in camel suits that unzip and unbutton, are among the performers, as well as Australian artist and fashion designer Michaela Stark, who shows herself almost naked under a thin transparent veil, her body tied up in a long braid. Allanah Star, the luscious former showgirl, was in a flesh-coloured ""deshabillé"".
 
His fellow designers also came to help. Charles de Vilmorin, Rochas’s young creative director, did not go unnoticed. He was dressed in black, with a book in his hand, and a huge metal sculpture hanging above his head, via metal wires harnessed to his torso. Just like Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix, the duo at the head of the Egonlab label, who come out embracing each other, hand in hand, one with a mesh net slipped over a trouser leg and the other in white dungarees lined with press studs that can be completely decomposed. Vincent Pressiat, another young prodigy of the Paris fashion scene, was also spotted on the runway.The atmosphere is festive with colorful characters, from the nymphomaniac bimbo with a bare breast and a skirt slit all the way up to the thigh to baroque silhouettes in old-fashioned basket dresses, reviewed in an asymmetrical version with a half-open wicker cage. This extravagant wardrobe is hardly lacking in oversized accessories, such as rigid oblong or triangular bags like an umbrella, and huge headdresses made from several dozen meters of tulle fanning out over the head.

 Alphonse Maitrepierre has the same desire to have fun, but with an extra touch of poetry. For spring-summer 2023, the young designer was inspired by the tale of Peau d'âne and Jacques Demy's famous film, but again with a very unique interpretation. The donkey has disappeared and been replaced by a horse recreated in a flowery fabric, which can be worn as a cape or shawl over a tight-fitting suit with the same motif. The horse's mouth is also found in the shape of the handbags.

The ""weather-coloured"" dress from the famous fairy tale is in fact a pretty ensemble of sky-blue trousers showing the belly and the ""sun-coloured"" one, a long flowing dress in golden silk. The fairytale dress has a balconette neckline and a more modern and almost sportswear feel to it. Ultra short, it almost becomes a top.

The designer alternates between tight-fitting sportswear and highly structured garments, creating new volumes, notably through short flared or reshaped jackets with a slight waist. He also has fun sliding the garment off the shoulders - sometimes it's just the straps that fall off - to recreate the silhouette of Peau d'âne covering herself with her fur coat. ""I always start from old archives to recreate something contemporary. Here, I wanted to rewrite history in my own way,"" says the designer backstage.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 26, 2022","Milan Fashion Week ended in beauty with the return of blue skies. Alongside Giorgio Armani, the undisputed king of Italian fashion, three outsiders stood out on Sunday with their spring-summer 2023 collections. These included Ferrari, which was on the catwalk for the second time in Lombardy with its new luxury ready-to-wear line; Ilaria Durazzi, a promising new name in Italian fashion; and the avant-garde London designer Matty Bovan, who was in Milan thanks to the support of Dolce & Gabbana.Ferrari pulls out all the stops Like last season, Ferrari went full out, this time inviting its guests to a theater, the Teatro Lirico. The red curtain rose in front of a crowded audience to reveal a film exalting the values of the house. The nighttime panoramic views of Los Angeles set the tone. For his third collection, designer Rocco Iannone was inspired by the sprawling Californian metropolis, which embodies all possibilities.

With a visor on their heads and comfortable colored sneakers, the models, both men and women, wore khaki canvas utilitarian suits, followed by sportswear - t-shirts, baggy cargo pants, sweaters, jackets - combined with more chic pieces such as silk tops and blouses, as well as a series of tie and dye denim outfits, in which the carmaker's famous Modena yellow was strongly present. For the evening, there were glittering outfits covered with silver maxi sequins and iridescent pleated skirts.
 
Leather is the star of the show with jackets and pants, but also superb driver's suits, available in black, brown, yellow and Ferrari red, as well as in a very sporty fleece version, like this red model with a black stripe, decorated with the multiple patches of Ferrari’s F1 sponsors that looked more real than real. And for good reason, this is Carlos Sainz’s suit, the prestigious Scuderia’s star racer. 
 
""I didn't just want to tell the story of the automotive world, but this season I tried to capture the essence of Ferrari’s spirit through the archive images and the imagination created around this legendary brand. There are the Ferrari codes, but also many other elements mixed between them. Starting with the four main materials of the collection, cotton, denim, leather and silk"", explained the creative director, who says he has created a ""practical and contemporary"" wardrobe that skilfully merges tailoring, workwear and the world of motor racing.Ilenia Durazzi: it’s all in the smallest details 
Durazzi? It's the emerging name that everyone is talking about on the Milanese fashion scene. Originally from Urbino, in the Marche region, Durazzi is no beginner. At 34, the Italian has 13 years of experience in the luxury sector, eight of which she spent in Paris. She graduated from the Polimoda school in Florence, and moved to the French capital at 22 to do an internship in Balenciaga’s accessories department under the aegis of Nicolas Ghesquière. Two months later, she was hired. After bags and shoes, she moved on to men's clothing, which became her specialty.
 She then moved to Maison Margiela, where she gradually climbed the ladder to become head designer for menswear. Five years ago, she moved back to Italy to Milan, where she continues to work for major houses, including Tod’s as a consultant, while also collaborating on projects and exhibitions of contemporary art. This path led her to meet artist Maurizio Cattelan, with whom she founded her brand, Durazzi. The two art-lovers have been together since they met.

A high-end women's ready-to-wear label with a contemporary couture touch. The young woman injects all her know-how and experience, relying on a network of collaborators and first-rate suppliers, which she has patiently built up over a decade. Thus, her bags are made by the same manufacturers as the luxury brands. Everything is produced in Milan, including fabrics that she has developed exclusively for her brand. A first test collection launched in February 2022 seduced about 20 top boutiques in the world. Durazzi is making a statement with this new collection for spring-summer 2023, presented in her elegant Milanese studio-showroom.

Each piece is impeccably cut, and worked to the smallest detail. The ultra-fine knits are made of silk thread, the black nappa leather jacket is highlighted by a fine silver braid, and the buttons are marked with the Durazzi logo. Often a twist enhances the garment, like perforated pants with an animal spirit, knitted dresses adorned with pearls or a leather skirt decorated with raffia.

The designer starts with classic pieces, which she redefines through influences from art and architecture, but also from the equestrian world, her other passion. Thus the stretch jersey jumpsuit is equipped with adjustable leather straps and protections between the legs like riding pants, while the heels under the flat shoes adopt a horseshoe shape. The chosen positioning is high end, focusing on bags sold between 1,100 and 1,900 euros, while ready-to-wear is offered from 500 euros and shoes go up to 1,400 euros for the riding boots, Durazzi's emblematic piece.Matty Bovan’s punk-queer popBack on the catwalk with Matty Bovan. The British punk-queer-pop designer moved from London to Milan this season thanks to the support of Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, who provided him with fabrics. The designer is having a blast continuing his experiments with jacquards, damask fabrics and sublime brocade fabrics.Bovan graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2015. He was the winner of the LVMH Graduate Prize and the Woolmark Prize in 2021.This knitwear specialist cheerfully mixes textures, patterns and colors in voluminous and baroque patchwork constructions, playing on eccentric associations with a touch of psychedelia and excessive overlaying.

"Sep 26, 2022","A bunch of young designers are giving new life to Milan Fashion Week. In particular, five new creative directors that have just been appointed to iconic houses. From Salvatore Ferragamo to Etro and Benetton, several great debuts were feverishly awaited on the catwalks this weekend. Missoni and Bally included. Filippo Grazioli brought a touch of freshness to the former, while Rhuigi Villaseñor projected the latter into the future with a sophisticated, sexy spirit.
 Grazioli is giving Missoni a facelift. The stylist quietly joined the house last year after 18 years in Paris with Martin Margiela, Hermès and Givenchy. For his first show, the designer favored a soft approach, taking up the label's codes while evolving them with delicacy. The show was held in the luminous hall of Bocconi University on a mirrored catwalk, which reflected graceful silhouettes. The outcome was a very summery and colorful collection.
 
The show opened with a great classic of the house; a series of black and white outfits, using Missoni's emblematic technique of flamed knitwear. The dresses and knitwear ensembles follow ed one another in a mix and match of stripes and zebra stripes. The stripes collided to create abstract graphic paintings. The famous zigzag patterns of the Italian label were also revisited in maxi sizes or in a kaleidoscopic explosion.
 
A way for the designer to lay the foundations, like a blank canvas on which he gradually introduced cyan, magenta and yellow, the three shades chosen for each new look in turn. The cardigan or the knitted bodysuit matched with their skirt-coat, the tight dress with geometric patterns, the draped version or the one dripping down to the feet, slit on the side. Filippo Grazioli also played with transparency and shine with impalpable knit dresses that look like a second skin.An urban and industrial atmosphere at BallyFor his first Bally show, Villaseñor opted for a darker, urban and industrial setting with rusty sheet metal walls and street lamps with a foggy light. On Saturday, he unveiled the new image of the venerable Swiss shoe house, which had not shown for 21 years.

 The Filipino-born Californian designer founded the high-end streetwear brand Rhude in 2015 and this is the first time he has fully tried his hand at women's ready-to-wear. The result is a sophisticated and sexy woman, who likes to be noticed in her ultra-tight dresses with slits on all sides, worn if possible with rhinestone fishnet stockings, her very classy silk pyjama sets, her equestrian outfits with python boots or in slightly more daring outfits such as this four-pocket metallic gold jacket worn with a simple pair of matching boots or this sinuous black evening gown that opens up like a porthole on the buttocks just protected by a tanga.

The collection highlights leather pieces, from tops and pant sets to suede shirt dresses and leather lace maxi coats. The young designer introduces beachwear for the first time at Bally with very low-cut one-piece swimsuits, worn with jewelry, such as golden bracelets worn in lots of three for a flashy touch.

Villaseñor brings a good dose of Californian glamor and coolness to the heritage house. A good reflection of the designer himself, who can easily go from a double-breasted blazer suit to jeans and a reptile skin jacket, as long as he is wearing his very chic slippers with an elegant Bally coat.

The only downside were the sandals with vertiginous and unstable heels forcing the models to walk strangely and which look painful to wear. It's a bit confusing for a house that has 171 years of know-how in the shoe and luxury world.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 26, 2022","Riccardo Tisci took Burberry to the beach on Monday, in a show the house rescheduled due to the monarch’s recent passing. Though the seaside theme took place in Bermondsey, south London, and not Brighton or Bournemouth.Riccardo’s concept: the beach as a democratic leveller of British cultures and communities.

There were certainly plenty of sandy shades in the opening looks with floor length swirling skirts, or on Naomi Campbell, in a desert hued safari jacket over a schoolmarm skirt.Throughout his tenure, Tisci has played cleverly with the house’s plaid and this season was no exception - showing dark mud, slate gray and black combinations - made in materials like lace and waxed cotton. Composed into urban warrior parkas, lace blouses, layered chiffon skirts and even curious necklaces finished with three plaid pockets.

In keeping with the seaside theme, models wore four-inch long shark earrings; or seashell studs on mannish beach sandals. Riccardo will always love a graphic top, this season finished with giant sharks’ mouths or evil eyes.

Plenty of denim, and most of it carefully sun-bleached - overalls paired with silver sequin bras, Victorian skirts, sleeveless shirts. A Victoria mood that extended into some great bodycon Gothic evening dresses of layered satin and chiffon. In a coed show, the guys were gifted great tailoring, notably an eight-button blazer, with the top two buttons on the lapels. Often in black, though two in Ukrainian yellow and pale blue.“This collection is inspired by the beach as a place where humanity meets, a point where different worlds collide. That tension between dressing and undressing, between revelation and protection, underwear and outerwear, all feels relevant to now and part of Burberry’s modern DNA,” argued Riccardo in his program notes.

Not all Tisci’s experiments worked, another half dozen columns with swimwear inserted featured cut-outs at the crotch and hips that looked faintly daft. You could see from the models’ expressions they probably agreed. Like many Tisci shows, this one also rambled, with 81 looks, that could have done with a good edit to make his statement more focused. 

Yet, on a chilly morning, Burberry’s pulling power was still evident from the front row. Gillian Anderson was posing with Simone Ashley, the heroine of Bridgerton's second series, while Kanye West sat near Milly Alcock, the minute star of House of the Dragon. 

Ashley wore a black soft collared Burberry shirt dress reading from the abyss with love, over check gloves and dominatrix boots. Alcock came in a white and silver plastic and metal flapper's dress under a black trench coat. Both the two fashion ingenue actresses embraced Tisci warmly in the backstage, as did Kanye. 

The house had originally scheduled to stage the show on Saturday, September 17, though cancelled following the Queen’s passing a week before the show.

Burberry had planned to build a catwalk with an orchestra in Trafalgar Square. However, the idea that a brand with a royal warrant would stage a show so close to Buckingham Palace in a week of mourning for the monarch was clearly impossible. Leading CEO Jonathan Akeroyd made a smart, immediate executive decision.

Asked about recent rumours that Burberry had held talks with Daniel Lee, the former acclaimed designer of Bottega Veneta, about possibly replacing Tisci next year, CEO Akeroyd replied, narrow eyed: “I have nothing to say about that.”

Though the executive, who only joined in April, appeared in an ebullient mood. As well he should. In the most recent financial year, sales grew by 21% to £2.8 billion as Burberry emerged from the pandemic.Tisci’s contract is reportedly up for renewal next year, but if he does leave Burberry he can hold his head up high. While his shows have not received universal acclaim, he has certainly produced an important body of work, and some very beautiful products. Again this season with an impressive new bag in plaid or woven leather, which can slide up the forearms to look like cool armour. 

Moreover, Burberry remains the pre-eminent British luxury brand, with four giant electronic billboards greeting travellers at British Airways Terminal 5 at Heathrow.

Bizarrely, considering Burberry had hired the London Contemporary Orchestra, which played an original composition for a quarter of an hour as guests arrived, the models walked in almost continuous silence. Giving the event an oddly ""fin de siècle"" funeral mood, which some might interpret as an omen for the future. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 26, 2022","A final 24 hours of contrasts in the Milan runway season, starring Italy’s single most famous designer and its most mass market brand, Benetton, with the debut of Andrea Incontri; followed by a mass march at Moncler. Giorgio Armani: Elegiac reassurance There was something reassuring about the latest show from Giorgio Armani, that after the pandemic, war in Ukraine and economic crisis, a designer could still present a collection so effortlessly elegant and refined.Presented inside a pale-gray custom-made showroom inside his historic Via Borgonuovo palazzo, the collection had all the silvery elegance one associates with Armani’s signature line, along with a neat soupçon of couture-worthy embroidery.

Long before European designers had become obsessed with China, Armani had gone there in his imagination and multiple Asian references were the underpinning of this collection. The set was even composed of glass versions of vertical bamboo branches.From dhotis to salwar pants; to coolie jackets and blazers finished in Rajasthan patterns. Most of the floral decoration referenced tropical flowers and fauna, while the exotic jewelry all felt oriental.

At the finale, a dozen models, all in silver, took a languid stroll down the runway. Almost a case book fashion tutorial, where the designer was showing off the skill of his draping; the precision of his atelier.

Little wonder that most of the audience rose to their feet in an extended ovation as Giorgio took his bow. After his hesitant steps and a mock tumbling swim at Emporio on Thursday, there was an almost audible in-take of breathe as he appeared. 

Not to worry, clear-eyed and dressed in a navy blue deconstructed suit, a steady Armani milked the moment, wafting in the adulation. Rarely happier than when he knows he has pulled off a clear fashion statement. This is one designer - even at 88 - who never, ever stops working. Benetton: The fruits of lifeIs there a more popular designer in Milan, or make that Italy, than Andrea Incontri? Who enjoyed a two-minute ovation at the finale of his debut for Benetton.Every second merited in a upbeat, uber bright, fruit-covered collection for the Venetian label, staged inside its flagship on Corso Buenos Aires, the main mass market shopping thoroughfare of Milan.

Best to have taken a cappuccino before this 10 a.m. show, so bright was the color palette, opening with literally a score of looks in pink and orange. Everything from little coco suits in light cotton tweeds with wrap mini skirts; ribbed to the knee knit skirts and knit bra tops; or baby blue or canary yellow terry cloth dressing gowns. 

A full collection, featuring high-top sneakers, neat Benetton crocs and even rubber lemon print gardening boots. Handbags, totes and clutches matching the vibrant color palette.

Dozens of knits had fruit patterns; one-foot tall apples, punnets of strawberries; and white peach knit pattern. Seen in a total look of shorts, twin-piece, tote and cloche hat. Similar assemblages in cherry and crab apple followed.

“I wanted to focus on the product, an industrial product, where contrasts are very important. But also a little sweetness, and the idea of self care. That’s why I had so much fruit. People want the perfect body, so it’s nice to have the perfect fruit!” explained Incontri. Moncler: The triumph of the pufferThis Sunday, fifty million Italians went to the polls, poised to elect the first extreme right government since the Fascist era. On Saturday night, Moncler staged a mass show of some 1,972 extras performing a synchronised marches and military style salutes. All conforming to a single dress code - all-white.All designed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Moncler and its by now ubiquitous down jackets.

The visual resemblance with totalitarian marches and rallies was quite frankly disturbing. This is not in anyway to accuse Moncler or its staff of having reactionary political views. But given the current political situation, at the very least, it made one pause.

Too often, the mass hand gestures and repetitive manoeuvres recalled an insane mass rally for North Korea for Kim Jong-un, or Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will. If that sounds alarmist, you can easily check out the similarities on videos on Google. 

Unwittingly, Moncler’s birthday celebration mimicked the cinematic language of propaganda. Endless  group marches or synchronised movements and military salutes all staged before the Duomo of Milan, as if the cathedral was offering its benediction. 

Several editors opening expressed their concern, though in the elation of the spectacle nobody seems to have written about the obvious visual parallels. A steady day of rain meant the show happened very late Saturday.

Throughout the weekend, many designers - at Cavalli, Gucci and Bottega Veneta, to name a few - publicly expressed their concern about the threat they believe the right wing leader Giorgia Meloni represents. Meloni wants to deny gays the right to adopt, expel immigrants, reduce LGBTQI+ rights and restrict abortion. Though when one asks luxury executives, the reaction is generally just an embarrassed grimace.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2022","From one end of the Lombardy capital to the other, fashion shows are presented one after the after, accumulating a little more delay every day. For this great return to the catwalks, after two years of the pandemic, the houses wanted to go above and beyond. But putting on an extra-special show takes much more time. Thursday, especially, the shows were attractive and unusual, playing on theatrics for Act No. 1, playfulness for Moschino and acrobatics for Boss.
 Act No. 1 delivered a fashion show with great impact, which was inspired for spring-summer 2023 by the traditional Chinese opera. The first silhouettes, all in black, moved forward to the steady rhythm of percussion, their faces hidden by a painted mask or by large dark glasses. The girls with endless braids wore long glamorous gloves, perched on platform sandals adorned with metal chains, while the men were dressed in jackets and pants covered with large square pockets. A full range of denim looks were shown, in cotton in white or camel, organza in black or pink or sky-blue tulle.

Designer Luca Lin, the son of Chinese immigrants who settled in Italy, and his partner, Azeri Galib Gassanoff, who grew up in Georgia, reworked great classics. The collection included corsetry, sumptuous painted silk ensembles with oriental designs, revisited trench coats - in a bare-shoulder version this season -, and hybrid garments, where tulle is inserted as a great protagonist, in giant hoods, dresses with endless trains, enclosing the torso like an oversized fan or even in a white ‘cape-nuage’ enveloping a pantsuit.The show also featured a series of armor pieces made from vintage metal watch straps. At the forefront, supporting the young brand this season is Pierpaolo Piccioli, Valentino’s creative director. ""With this initiative, we are putting creativity back at the center. These young people need visibility and it's right to give them support. We chose them because we share the same values and they have talent in the way to tell it,"" he said.

The Moschino show was a whole other style. The designer brand threw itself into the deep end with a deliciously regressive collection, centered on the theme of inflatable floats. Creative director Jeremy Scott once again mocks the world of fashion with a jubilant wardrobe, cleverly sprinkling his elegant, retro-flavored seams with amusing inflatable details.

Floats are everywhere and of all types. Mini versions, worn as bracelets around the wrists or as a hat. Bicolored floats, like the ones you see on big ocean liners, worn on the head or around the waist, paired with a micro-suit with golden buttons or with a dress with deckchair stripes. And colorful duck or pink flamingo children's floaties happily encircle their bodies.

 The playful idea of the American designer is to overplay the inflatable effect. Thus, the necklines and edges of the clothes swell everywhere like excrescences. Pink or yellow plastic jackets are filled with air for a bibendum effect, the sleeves of an evening dress take the shape of two colored rubber dolphins jumping out of the water, from wrists to shoulders. Folded up, the inflatable beach bed turns into a lovely stole or a train. Likewise, the yellow beach bag is mostly reminiscent of a life jacket.
 
Elsewhere, inflated to the brim, the plastic blow-ups were transformed into collars, lapels or buttons in the shape of red hearts on little black dresses. They wrapped around the neck, hips, arms and even legs to tuck the dresses, sometimes impeding movement. In the accessories department, the bucket and the child's ball completed the panoply as bags.

Boss ended the day with a big show, taking his audience to the Vigorelli velodrome, which he transformed into a galactic track against a scenery of illuminated skyscrapers. As a backdrop, giant glittering wire mesh globes, which will be dominated at the end of the show by acrobats on two wheels.

Already ready to be sold, the flagship collection of German house Hugo Boss consists mainly of suits and heavy coats in wool sheets and men's fabrics in 50 (or so) shades of gray (but also beige, white and black), worn indifferently by men and women. And the suit can be sexy, especially the fitted one worn by Naomi Campbell, who opened the show in excellent form under the crackling of phones. Khaby Lame, muse of the brand and well known Senegalese Tiktoker, was also greatly admired during his passage in a white outfit. 

A sporty vibe, inspired by the world of motorcycles, interferes in this seemingly classic wardrobe, to energize it through more technical outfits, such as  leather jackets and pants with protections, while the matching fabric helmet becomes the chic accessory of the season.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2022","Milan has more busy showroom presentations that most cities have good restaurants. From capsule collections to fully fledged marques to hot shoe labels, there are a score most days. 

FashionNetwork.com took the fashion pulse of the city with the eight contrasting approaches:  Max & Co., Weekend Max Mara, Fabiana Filippi, Gianvito Rossi, Alberto Biani, Sergio Rossi, Loro Piana and Giuseppe Zanotti.Max & Co.For a novel take on market segmentation one visits Max & Co.; a more youthful, price-sensitive take on fashion from the luxury giant Max Mara.A capsule collection with changing creators, this season helmed by Duro Olowu, the parchment dry-witted UK designer of Nigerian origin.

A fresh source of inspiration too: the art of Luigi Ghirri, the respected Italian art photographer.“His photographs were really simple images of Italian towns and seaside that I love. So, I imagined him having the opportunity to go to Dakar in Senegal or Bamako in Mali and shoot there in the same way,” explained Duro.

Hence, some intriguing curly prints, which Duro christened the 'Bamako' point, that managed to be both geometric and psychedelic. Made into some attractive sun dresses, gathered slightly under the bust and finished with side pockets, that be paired with short matching jackets and even shoes.

High waisted trousers and bold striped shirts, mixed with classic blazers though in bright hues of orange, and very pretty florals with navy backgrounds with contrasting trim -- all made for a collection of real charm. 

“I call the jacket, our comfort blanket for travelling,” smiled Duro.

Easy to understand and easy in which to travel, ideal for the younger customer Max & Co. has been invented to dress.Weekend Max Mara: From Lily with lovePlenty of joie de vivre at Weekend Max Mara, where model and designer Lily Aldridge designed the latest collection.“Vibrant and playful, it’s inspired by my father. An amazing artist, very into psychedelic art. Which is where all the bright colours are coming from,” Lily told FashionNetwork.com, in a presentation.

Entitled 'From Lily with Love', the 20-piece capsule starred some great prints inspired by papa, where hippie butterflies, strawberries, drooping tulips and dandelions were seen in crinkly coats or silk pyjama tops.

Mixed in with classic pieces, and a good deal of denim on denim; timeless knit dresses or sweet lace frocks, capturing the California gal in Lily, and riffing on her illustrator dad and art legend Alan Aldridge.

“The beauty of working with Max Mara is you get really great quality, impeccable tailoring and the fun sensation that my ideas are made to perfection,” concluded Lily.Fabiana Filippi: Umbria’s latest fashion starItaly’s unique ability to invent plausible and polished brands never ceases to surprise. A good example is Fabiana Filippi; an optimistic brand that is all about smart and approachable separates. Originally founded back in 1985 as a knitwear label, Fabiana Filippi has grown into a wide ranging  selection that encompasses a full modern wardrobe. Based near Perugia, the capital of Umbria, whose most famous painter Perugino has a noted fresco in the Sistine Chapel, The Delivery of the Keys. Its colours had an uncanny echo in Fabiana Filippi’s color scheme this season.

Presented inside a sunny garden amid mock Roman statues and modernist sculptures, the collection featured lightweights suits; cool double-breasted blazers; and natty nylon trenches.

For evening, long ribbed dresses, either in plissé chiffon or finished with pockets.  All made in a natural color palette of taiga green, seaweed, Sorrento lemon, copper and putty. 

“Modern, elegant and sustainable,” responded Fabiana Filippi, after whom the brand is named. Her father and uncle, Giacomo and Mario Coccetta, respectively, founded and own the marque. It now retails in several hundred doors, boasting annual sales of close to €100 million.

A success celebrated with a dinner of tuna tartare and pesto pasta, washed down by red Valpolicella and white Falanghina wine. Dining on an elegant table, worthy of this smart fashion brand.Alberto Biani: Sveva’s svelte chic “The image of imperfection,“ explained Sveva Alviti, the blonde beauty actress who designed her debut collection with Angela Biani, daughter of designer and brand founder, Alberto Biani. Alviti, the Roman-born star of the critically acclaimed biopic Dalida, emphasised the tuxedo, and the result was an impressive fashion debut, centered on the dazzling for evening.

Hints of vintage Saint Laurent about this collection, which featured elongated tuxedo columns, ideal for a red carpet moment or great entrance at a stylish soirée. Made in some tremendous Italian fabrics, like a cotton satin that included some metallic threads to impart a great crinkly finish. 

“Perfect imperfection,” smiled Angela.

Also impressing were tuxedos cut as mess jackets in lightweight jacquard finished with exotic cock feathers and paired with cigarette pants trimmed with more feathers.

Multi-talented, Alviti wrote and starred into a collection video shot in French and filmed in Paris, about a troubled beauty who dresses up with panache, in order to restore her mood.

Based in the Veneto, near the intellectual city of Padua, Alberto Biani also showed the main collection, an impeccably made series of silk pyjama jacket and suits in summery small flower prints.Gianvito Rossi: Byzantine empress goes to St Tropez“I like to try to make women look really good,” explained Gianvito Rossi, one the world’s great contemporary shoe designers. And one with really great range.For day, some superb slingback and high heels with transparent plastic straps finished with candy-hue crystal stones. Kinda’ 'Byzantine empress goes to St Tropez'. For summer cocktails, splendid centurion’s sandals whose silver straps marched up the calf, finished with mini GV buckles. And for evening, Gianvito showed great black leather booties with crystal necklaces running around and down the ankle. 

Given his unerring sense of how women like to be shod, the Gianvito Rossi brand has grown consistently since being founded in 2007.  

Today, the house boasts its own network of almost 30 boutiques, a further 20 franchise stores and over 250 wholesale accounts.

Inside his via Santo Spirito showroom, Rossi also presented very fine sandals and high heels in rolled tubular leather that recalled 1960s furniture. “That is me in Paris and this is me in California,” laughed Rossi, as he pointed to a second group with psychedelic prints.

Like everyone, the pandemic was very tricky for his label.

“The last thing anyone was thinking about during covid was high heels,” conceded the gentlemanly Gianvito, who helped burnish his brand with a central city tram in Milan this week, freshly painted with his logo and shoes.Sergio Rossi: Brilliance at BredaA happy mood at Sergio Rossi, as the brand hit its sweet spot with a collection of classic-with-twist shoes in the 29th-floor penthouse of Torre Breda, an iconic Milanese tower, which when built, was Italy’s tallest building.Slingback with pearl straps had all the kick one expects from Sergio Rossi, as did pink matte satin heels with artful bows.

It’s a marque that has bounced back quickly from the pandemic. Three years ago revenues slipped to €48 million. Last year they totalled €70 million.

And is already looking to the next step, when it will create a capsule collection with Area, to be unveiled in New York Fashion Week next February. 

Sergio Rossi’s hard-charging CEO Riccardo Sciutto is mulling a New York pop-up showroom to coincide with the Area show. In the meantime, he proudly shows off the style and production skill of the house. Like steel spikes inserted into transparent plastic heels and Chinoiserie-style wedges.

The brand’s main plant is also busy near the Adriatic coast of Emilia-Romagna, producing some 1,000 pairs of shoes daily, or 250,000 pairs per year. While sub-contractors, stretching from Lombardy to Spain, for espadrilles, produce another 100,000 pairs.

Like many Italian luxury executives, Sciutto is wary about next year - amid concerns about the continued lockdown in China and inflation years in the U.S.; widely expected to dampen consumer sentiment. 

However, as he points out himself, even a 10% rise in sales would mean a record sales year for Sergio Rossi. Loro Piana: Confusion and no clarityThe uber quality was clear, but the concept confusing at Loro Piana, where the idea was travel from the brand’s homeland in Piedmont through five regions to end up in Sicily. Faux postcards of sunny islands and mountains covered the walls, inside Casa Cipriani, a new, rather uptight club, and the latest venture from the New York hospitality brand.

Things started well in Piedmont, with a superb cashmere and silk dressing gown-style coat, made to look like shearling. A matelassé waistcoat with outside pockets had wit, too. Though quite how these were spring/summer looks was tricky to comprehend, though these looks apparently will go into store in February. 

Heading further south one could admire a lightly-logoed white canvas Breton sailor’s top and multi-pleated safari shorts. However, the further down the Italian boot one travelled the more banality took over. 

A yellow peasant dress was dreary; while several other jackets and tops were bizarrely bulky and unflattering, while an oversized coriander and cream striped linen and a broad striped poncho looked attractive, they also brought to mind the name Gabriela Hearst. 

Someone in the accessories department did whip up some neat canvas and leather trimmed mini totes, but that certainly did not save this display. 

One assumes the ides was to inject a higher fashion quotient into the brand, but all it did was remind one of its lack of fashion news. And of a designer, seeing this was clearly made by a design team with all the compromises that entails. 

No wonder other brands are targeting the market in Italian discreet luxury; Loro Piana, for so long its leader, is creating a stylistic vacuum.
 Giuseppe Zanotti: Helpful holograms “Technology and holograms. One has to move with the times,” explained Giuseppe Zanotti at his packed presentation on Via Monte Napoleone.Holograms in shades of tortoise shell or Pacific blue seen on angular wedges with crystal straps, or towering high-heel platforms. 

Other elements that caught the eye were the vegan leather pearly silver high heels, or lightweight sling-backs constructed in resin.

“By now, over 30% of our collection no longer is made of animal products,” added Zanotti.

Though his tech touch did not prevent Giuseppe presenting classical Zanotti with a twist, like a crystal chain bootie that looked like a Constructivist sculpture.

Moving with the times, keeping his mood fresh, Zanotti is still very much a market leader.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2022","Hollywood took over Milan Fashion Week on Saturday, with a Kardashian-led Kim Dolce & Gabbana show; a debut at Ferragamo dedicated to silver screen glamour and some model diversity at Bottega Veneta.Fan craziness in overdrive outside the joint collection Kim X Dolce & Gabbana, as thousands of fans screamed and roared while mobile phone filming the arrivals Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner, along with four Wests - Chicago, Psalm, North and Saint. All egged on by a dry-ice machine, a camera crane with old style cine-cameras, and a mock ego-manic film director ordering around editors and influencers as if they were extras.

Inside, Kim on the big screen. Shot Marilyn Monroe-style in black and white, leisurely eating a bowl of spaghetti pomodoro, ever so often gently wiping her rouge-lipped with a linen tablecloth. Hair done up like a 50s screen star, dressed in a metallic sequin cocktail and wearing black gloves, she finished off her dish as the final model appeared.With mum, sister Jenner and daughters West sitting front row, one witnessed high-octane Hollywood boudoir fantasy on the catwalk. Lots of innerwear as outerwear: black lace body stockings; leotards covered in jade beads; silver bugle beads bustiers; black satin bras, endless bloomers. Bodycon fashion throughout.

Before, the show went into overdrive. Just as Kim finished off her plate, out emerged metallic gold va-va-vroom cocktails; transparent gauze coat-dresses cinched with a S&M Lonsdale belt; and a metropolis-like stiff metal bodice cocktail. At which point Kim licked her lips with satisfaction.

Barely a hint of Dolce & Gabbana’s beloved Sicily but lots of Santa Monica-sex appeal. Which ended as Kim took a solo ovation in a glistening anthracite Swarovski crystal column, caressing her legendary hips. To be joined by Domenico and Stefano for a joint bow, as Kim blew air kisses in the direction of her family.

“In my soul I feel like a very sensual Italian mob wife,” Kim emoted at an earlier morning Milan press conference, in full Sopranos-mode.Ferragamo: A new star is bornEveryone in Milan celebrated the debut of new star on Saturday morning. His name is Maximilian Davis, and he made his creative debut at Salvatore Ferragamo, with a highly accomplished ode to Hollywood glamour that puts the brand right back at the centre of the fashion universe.“I wanted to delve into the extraordinary history of the house and remember that Signor Ferragamo began his career in Hollywood dressing the great stars, like Marilyn Monroe,” explained the quiet-spoken Davis, post show.

This season they also eliminated the founder’s name Salvatore from the brand, and Davis certainly cut away plenty of clutter. One of his hottest looks was a sinful red mannish lapel-free wrap blazer with hidden buttons that hung perfectly. 

Presented inside the courtyard of a neo-classical former seminary on Corso Venezia, set to become the latest luxe hotel in the Ferragamo family chain. All the cobblestones and walls covered in a blend of Ferragamo’s blood red logo.

“Staging it in here felt like the right way to underline both new beginnings,” explained Davis.

Red rippled through the collection; from a postbox red jumpsuit worn with matching water bottles, heels and huge clutch. A clear reference to the 1959 shoes Salvatore made specially for Marilyn. Though at its core was the tuxedo, dress pant and waistcoat - cut with retro panache but styled with real edge. One see-through top even boasting a diagram, with Lucifer on top and Hell on the right hand side.

Shifting from mono-colours to Rachel Harrison’s Sunset Series in silk leotards, sheathes, gowns, semi-sheer shirt dresses and leather totes. Also impressing were hologram-style bronzed jeans and shirts. Plus, Davis harnessed Ferragamo’s leather skills in matching leggings, polo, water-bottles and duster in beige suede. And a great new pump with a circular heel looks like becoming the must-have shoe.

Mind you, Davis’ definition of movie-star glamour is a broad one. For boys that includes hooded and puckered leather jerkins with matching mini shorts and bovver boots or white nylon parkas and pants that look like they should be accessorised with a geiger counter.

A tad eccentric, though it also added spice to this first at bat by a young designer who seems to arrived as a proper star.Bottega Veneta: Perverse banalityDiversity and the energy; what it brings and ensures were the wellsprings of Bottega Veneta’s collection, the second instalment from creative director Matthieu Blazy.Conversations with friends and colleagues about diversity led to an exchange with artist Gaetano Pesce who created a truly remarkable acid trip set of molten resin chairs and floor inside a disused factory in south Milan. 

Hand-molded at the entrance was the Italian expression: “This is a tribute to diversity. Diversity is what makes people and renders them unique.”

On a day when Italy voted for its next government, it would be hard to minimise the level of concern about the future direction of the country in the fashion community. Especially with Giorgia Meloni, an anti-immigrant extreme right winger who favours denying gays the right to adopt children, the favourite to win and form an extreme right government, for the first time since Mussolini. 

BV’s show, instead, featured a diverse cast from kids to veteran Kate Moss, who appeared in a plaid shirt leather jeans made to look like denim - a key ploy in Blazy’s first show.

Clearly keen to underline his skills, he cut a series of beautiful mannish coats, radically lowering the waist and displacing pockets back to suggest movement. While a femme-fatale power suit turned out to be made of grazed leather. His cast walked so fast, a series of scarves attached to several dresses fluttered mightily. 

Blazy also played with BV’s intreccio with some enormous hobo bags for its world traveller clientele; over the shoulder clutches; knobby pumps and some brilliant boots with bevelled wedges.

The front row was full of local artists and the mother-and-son characters of the Oscar winning movie The Power of the Dog, Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee.

“The idea was the world is a small room. So we added characters, and more characters to represent the diversity of our world. What you can do at Bottega that you can’t do elsewhere? Leather, so we take the clothes we wear in the studio and then make them in shaved leather. It’s all very technical and they have no stitches. We call it perverse banality,” explained Blazy.

However, what was most striking was the jagged graphic check and print dresses and coats, riffing on Giacomo Balla’s colourful drawings of suits for men.

Like in his first collection, where Blazy harked back to the pre-war Italian artist Umberto Boccioni, this one referenced Balla, another 1930s Futurist. Somewhat ironically, their greatest work was both created in the Fascist era.

“I think the Futurists were at the birth of modernity. They were game changers. And today we have the technology, to realise their ideas and push it to an extreme. This is not looking back, but forward,” he concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 24, 2022","Fashion loves nothing more than a debut, and in a season of five in Milan, Etro went first. Though the star appearance of the day was that of a veteran, a striking cyberpunk display by Donatella Versace that felt like a major statement.Versace: Cyberpunk rebellion rulesA new CEO and a new burst of energy at Versace, where Donatella dreamed up a punchy cyberpunk-take on the brand with all the sass, strut and sex one always hopes for in one of her shows.Staged in the latest massive hanger discovered on the outskirts of Milan, with a dozen supermodels marching down the catwalk. A set that included a series of glass tableaux like a grand piano; sitting of Medusa renaissance gold chairs and an electric candlelit nerve centre.

Gigi Hadid igniting the action in a semi-sheer black mesh gown, with cutouts and a cowl. The first of ten looks all in black, from Adut Akech in a cowboy fringed leather motorbike jacket worn with a mini mini to Irina Shayk in a deep gorge gown dissected by a Lonsdale belt.A black lipped, brooding and inclusive cast marching on punky platforms, slinky kitten heels or five-inch spike heels.

Before it all went into overdrive in a mega final of Versace vixens in distressed and destroyed jeans, under ripped-up ankle length cardigans; feather bow-like shawls and crystal encrusted scarf skirts.

Climaxing with a series if sizzling hot brides in barely-there lace dresses, suspenders, lace gloves, taught bustiers and veils. Talk about naughty brides.

Ending to cheers and applause for Paris Hilton in a tiny crystal pink cocktail and veil.

“Vero Versace,” commented Donatella Versace, as she embraced Hilton, Chiara Ferragni and Fernanda Lima.

Dozens of paparazzi and scores of fans swarming around to shoot videos, amid a gang of bodyguards.

“There’s lots of things to do, which is great. Donatella is brilliant, so enthusiastic and with such great sharp energy,” beamed new CEO Emmanuel Gintzburger, looking very dapper in an all-black Versace rock gent suit.Etro: A new take on paisley A new designer and a new broom swept through the house of Etro and with the debut at the house on Friday of Roman-born Marco De Vincenzo.A sharp change of pace in the clothes, with a dozen denim looks opening the action in a show staged in a agreeably wrecked disused north Milan factory.

De Vincenzo right away knocked a decade off the target segment with a dozen denim looks, not the fabric one necessarily associates with Etro. Denim bras; hot pants, thigh boots, coats, cloaks and cloches. Even if they were nearly all made of paisley - probably the defining print of the house. 

All through the show he cut a whole series of giant pants worn by a cast all of whom marched in towering, pointy clogs. Elongated trousers in jacquard, brocade and black satin - often completed by urban-clubber gold chains dangling from the pockets.

Again a pretty radical departure from the posh hippie chic of his two predecessors - Veronica and Kean Etro.

That said, there were echoes of that aesthetic at the finale, with a beautiful Arcadian print mini cocktail with tassels. In between, one could recognise De Vincenzo’s own oeuvre, bright satin skirts with accordion pleat trim or dip-dyed light-weight Aran sweaters, tanks and coat dresses.

“Etro is known for the richness of its fabrics, and its incredible archives. But by simply following my imagination I tried to tell a new story. And to break down the past,” De Vincenzo told FashionNetwork.com, in a pre-show preview. 

Noticeably, the new creative director lavished plenty of love on the logo - clamping Etro’s winged horse on woollens, handbags, silk baseball shirts and golden earrings.

Not quite a hit, and certainly no home run, but at least a fresh take on Etro.Tod’s: Back to the 90s, minimallyBack to the 90s at Tod’s, where designer Walter Chiapponi referenced the minimalism and big shoulders of the era in a brilliantly staged show in art institute, Pirelli HangarBicocca.Chiapponi even revived the Di bag, the leather Tod’s tote that was a staple for Princess Diana whenever she went to the gym. 

Though it was former French first lady Carla Bruni who opened the action, striding down the 100-meter runway in a diaphanous trench coat worn over a matching mauve suit, moccasins and tote.

“The nineties is the era I grew up in. I liked its minimalism, sharp lines and simplicity. So no decoration,” explained Chiapponi.

Tod’s traditionally shows in PAC, the main contemporary art centre of central Milan, and the move to Bicocca felt fresh. Especially as the cast marched underneath Anselm Kiefer’s magnificent permanent installation, 'The Seven Heavenly Palaces'.

The artist’s crumbling gray concrete towers, juxtaposed to the precise collection. Which emphasised quality and construction, and came in a warm color palette of skin-tones, makeup, sand, ecru and mauve.

All about manipulating codes, in a co-ed collection that featured menswear for guys incorporated into the womenswear; from oversized boyfriends' coats and blazers or mannish pleated trousers.

Chiapponi also played around with the signature rubbed stud soled Gommino moccasin, and blew up the proportions and contrasting colours so much that Tod’s owner Diego della Valle renamed it 'Babbo'; meaning the Italian for 'daddy'.

The Gommino studs also showed up on parkas; bikers jackets and nylon splash coats. Plus, Walter whipped up plenty of new bags, particularly with his favourite graphic 'T' on pony-skin clutches.

“Using stretch leather in long skirts with masculine shirts, I find very 90s,” smiled Chiapponi, wearing a sweatshirt that read, 'I Support Black Education'.

Indeed, the best single moment was a sculptural black leather sleeveless dress with a jauntily cut funnel neck worn by a black model. Simple, chic and somehow very now. Minimalism for today.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 23, 2022","Thursday marked a day of thrilling shows in Milan; from the Riviera romance of Max Mara and the grand minimalism of Prada, to an orchestra-led display by MM6 and a giant ovation at Emporio Armani for Giorgio. Suddenly, the Italian fashion system appears awoke and in rude health.Emporio Armani: The king takes a bowWhatever else you say about this latest Emporio show, it had one of the all time great ovations.
Unsteady on his feet, but beaming and determined, the 88-year-old Armani took his bow to an enormous roar. In a season dominated by the passing of the Queen, one could not help feeling impressed by the grittiness of Armani, the doyen of the industry.And the last man standing, seeing as all his great rivals have either sold up or gone public. The applause this Thursday afternoon as much for Armani’s remarkable career and life as for the collection. Which, though erratic, had moments of real beauty.

Staged before an LED wall and runway of a watery sunset, Emporio opened with soft shouldered linen suits, blazers and chauffeur's jackets worn with knitted skull-caps, berets and tam o’ shanters. Quite why Armani covered pants with skirts of tulle and gauze was hard to fathom, as were the weirdly proportioned baby doll dresses with way too high waists.Initially, the palette was blissfully non-color; putty, ecru, off-white and faded beige. And, just when one felt a sense of ennui, suddenly the show changed gear with some soft Asian-inspired jackets, dhotis and tanks beautifully printed with tropical flowers, before climaxing with crystalline sequin tops worn over billowing silk pyjama pants.

Setting the stage for Armani’s 40-second bow, where he mocked himself by pretending he was staggering, before gently exiting, even as he carefully touched the LED backdrop for balance.

Thunderous applause marched the king of Italian fashion as he departed his throne; his catwalk on Via Bergognone.Prada: Pandemonium outside, calm in the interiorNo show in Milan draws as many fans as Prada, where several thousands teenagers gathered to cheer their heroes, in-and-out of the brand’s headquarters.

Scores of black-suited security ferried in the celebs that, judging from the fans, included more K-pop stars that cinematic royalty. That said, a chaotic moment followed by a truly polished display from Miuccia Prada and design partner, Raf Simons. This season, staged in front of soaring black paper walls, and cut-out windows offering sunset views, courtesy of film auteur Nicolas Winding Refn, whose most celebrated film is Drive, the movie that launched Ryan Gosling. Even the doorways into four different show-spaces were made of scissored paper.

Suitably austere for a show that opened with a half-dozen mono-color assemblages. For this is as minimalist as Prada gets - battleship gray nylon redingotes over pale gray stretch cotton leggings and boyish shirts. The palette was startling reined-in: pearl, putty, gray and teal.

The duo’s most bravura idea - a new jumpsuit, though topped by a tailored shirt and completed with leggings. On a lithe figure one will look like a Milanese style-setter par excellence.

For evening, a series of Rothko-reminiscent printed silk slip dresses and cocktails ending just below the knee. For cool spring nights, several very clever cardigans, worn backwards with just one large button. Arty but never antiseptic, where all the cast appeared with bedraggled hair and enormous eye lashes.

The whole show seemed to have just one shoe, but it sure was a good one. A round-heel clog-like pump made in bevelled black, lime and dull orange.

While their new tote bag covered in leather roses and made in distressed leather seems a sure-fire hit, an idea that continued in a series of jersey dress, again finished with a handful of fabric roses. Though the key moment in the collection were the semi-sheer gauzy skirts, wrap coats and dresses - where big black bloomers were very evident.

One has perhaps seen bolder and more adventurous Prada shows. But, one could also not fail to applaud the sheer authority of these clothes; the genuine sense of empowerment; their overall confidence.MM6: Stravinksy-driven starsOne brand in fine fettle in Milan this month is MM6, the contemporary line of the house of Martin Margiela, which hired the 60-piece Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano to backup a really great show inside the Auditorium Fondazione Cariplo.The location was in Largo Gustav Mahler, but the orchestra opened with Stravinsky’s 'The Rite of Spring', a perfect platform for a collection that blended youth quake and quirky conceptualism.

The design team gets the DNA of Margiela, from the shotgun perforated fabrics used in worn violet jeans or black sweatshirt/dresses for men cut with volume and even elongated blazers in white.

The sense of the unexpected and the juxtaposition of materials one associates with MM6 was also triumphant. Wearing bathing suits or leotards as unbuttoned tops or rotating worn sweaters by 90 degrees to turn them into zipped mini skirts. Producing witty visual puns like the mini-bag made of a doubled over ballet slipper.

A sense of arty volume too. The opening oversized leather spy coat cinched by a big fabric belt, worn with  micro-mesh leggings that finished in a shoe. 

All mixed in with some fab nylon boot/sneakers, courtesy of a partnership with ski-maker Salomon, that included several punchy high-tech waistcoats that also operated as backpacks.

Under the guidance of Renzo Rosso’s holding company OTB, MM6 has grown into an impressive marque. Worldwide the brand boasts 29 flagships, over half them in Japan. It also retails in over 500 sales points from department stores to big boutiques like Dover Street Market.

A success celebrated by this show inside the Auditorium Fondazione Cariplo, greeted at the finale with prolonged applause.

There was a time when Cariplo was the biggest savings bank in the world, and it was good to see the institution saved some of the money to make this acoustically brilliant auditorium with its interior wooden roof and walls.Max Mara: Goddesses in godetsEileen Gray encountered Renée Perle, in a ode to Riviera sophistication in an impressively understated statement of pure elegance at Max Mara.Gray’s cerebral modernism apparent in some perfectly cut and sculpted dresses that were at the heart of this collection. Often referencing Eileen’s legendary E 1027 villa at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin with its symmetrical floor plan occasionally leavened by curves.

Max Mara built its reputation on being the best coat maker in Italy, and it’s a tribute to creative director Ian Griffiths’ skill that it’s now a go-to source of great dresses.

His favourite material, lino greggio, an undyed linen that recalls burlap and was cut into some grand mega-flared sailors pants with front bibs; spruce blazers with oversized flaps; and languid dusters.

Though Ian’s biggest idea was a series of godet dresses, where the extra fabric, cut on the bias, made the dresses flare with great polish.  

“I learnt all about the godet from Ossie Clark. He taught me the intricacies of making them, and the key of including the extra fabric cut on the bias,” smiled Griffiths, referring to his former fashion tutor.

Before pointing to a sketch by Clark on his mood board in the backstage. A series of images of the halcyon days of the 1920s and 30s when the Riviera was being discovered by artists like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso, Stravinksy; and muses such as Perle, the lover of photographer Jacques-Henri Lartigue.

All topped by some magnificent hats. Giant Provencal straw hats twisting and curling, as if the sun had dried them just so. All accessorised with rope platforms, and massive straw totes. One could almost feel the heat around Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat even on a chill Milan morning. 

The Côte d’Azur may be famed for its fauna and sturdy nature, but there was barely a print in sight, except for a quintet of abstract floral print columns - all of them in mixes of gray, black and white. 

Though Ian did include some summer hues of bitter yellow, egg shell and lichen - seen in a trio of marvellous cashmere coats worn over entre deux guerre swimsuits. Along with a little bleu de travail, the faded sea blue seen in well-used French workers' jackets.
 
No wonder he entitled the collection 'The Blue Horizon', a classy and cool array of fashion precisely at a moment when so many other designers seem to be trying that bit too hard. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 23, 2022","On Wednesday, the Milanese catwalks unveiled some very attractive collections for women who like to express themselves through their looks. For spring-summer 2023, designers had fun working with different female sensibilities. Like Alessandro dell'Acqua, who explored passion, or Daniele Calcaterra, who focused on a more mature and confident woman.
 This season, the designer and founder of the ready-to-wear brand No. 21 has put the figure of the lover and/or mistress under the radar, photographing through a very cinematographic language, and with a pinch of humor, the different states of mind of a secret love affair, where his muse, distraught with love, is alternately adored and then abandoned.

Perched on vertiginous mules with no visible heels, the models interpret the games of love through their outfits. The mesh suit lined with bright red sequins expresses passion, while certain floral or feathered outfits express joy. The tight skirt and powder pink mini-top ensembles, with their bare stomachs, evoke eroticism, while sex is suggested by several skin-coloured pieces, such as a ruffled nightie or lace blouse. In particular, a sinuous flesh-coloured skin-tight dress glistening as if the model had just got out of her bath naked. 
 
Sadness and pain are embodied in ""dark lady"" looks, via dark minidresses and jumpsuits with plunging necklines, and a whole series of clothes in transparent black rags. Not even the wedding dress is missing, which evidently was never used, so it was torn apart in a rage, as illustrated by the last models. These are ultra-short white outfits, - skirts, jackets, underwear and strapless dresses - disheveled with threads and unfinished, which have been made from dismantled and reassembled vintage wedding dresses.""It's a collection made up of states of mind, where you go very quickly from one expression to another, from the most absolute sweetness to total hatred,"" laughs Dell'Acqua, who worked a lot on attitude, imagining his character caught in the act, obliged to sneak out with the little cardigan buttoned askew, the crumpled shirt, which comes out of the jumper, the zip of the skirt left open, which lets a pair of red pants show through. Not to mention the brightly coloured retro satin bras and panties, which protrude cheerfully from the bodices and play the starring role under the transparent shirts, while the nylon stockings, badly put on, pull on the calves.

  
Calcaterra offers a totally different approach, working this season on volumes. As if inflated by the wind, the inspirational element of this collection for spring-summer 2023, the garments take on extra-large dimensions, while this airy spirit is also reflected in a series of macramé pieces made from woven raffia, including tunics, jackets, trousers, bags with long fringes and boots.

The blazers are loose and rounded, the classic sleeveless men's jacket is oversized with large armholes, becoming a giant waistcoat. The white shirts, also sleeveless, are tightened at the waist with a black belt for an hourglass effect. Trousers and Bermuda shorts are also worn very loosely.

Daniele Calcaterra plays on contrasts, layering  different weights, from linen and leather to silk and ultra-light chiffon. The outfits are mainly monochrome, predominantly white or black, with occasional infiltrations of caramel-coloured distressed leather suits, bottle green dresses and a few lemon-yellow ensembles. 

""My woman is always very androgynous, with this masculine side that I love, but this season she reveals strong accents of sensuality,"" says the designer backstage.

"Sep 22, 2022","A light, warm and cheerful breeze blew across the Milanese catwalks on Thursday. On the second day of the shows, the designers imagined a carefree and colourful summer 2023. At Dsquared2, we find the torrid and summery atmosphere of a beach holiday, while the Japanese fashion house Anteprima took its public to the heart of nature, to a park, to celebrate its 30th anniversary. 
Judging by the shows seen so far, from Fendi to No.21, all in transparency and sensuality, there will be no need to dress up next summer, or just a little. With global warming, women's wardrobes are down to a few skimpy pieces and impalpable tunics, where lingerie is the season's key accessory, as demonstrated by Dsquared2 on Thursday.

Twins Dean and Dan Caten chose a sumptuous palace to unveil a collection that is glittering and fun, casual and elegant, playing on a very successful mix of colours and materials, from sun-kissed pastel shades, to the shiny effects of sequins and varnished fabrics, to an explosion of brightly coloured check patterns.It's all about layering. Jackets, blouses, tunics, dresses, jumpsuits and impalpable or translucent loincloth skirts are worn over neoprene sports tops or nylon cycling shorts, giving the ensemble an airy feel. Some translucent jersey garments suggest a wet effect, while others, in terry cloth, underline a beach spirit.

There is no shortage of sexy numbers. Jackets and skirts in transparent plastic, just edged with white seams, expose the body barely covered by a bikini, as do sky-blue lace trousers. Elsewhere, dresses and skirts in sparkling sequins are strategically unzipped on a breast, a thigh, or in the lower back.

 The same freshness can be found at Anteprima. Founded in 1993 by Izumi Ogino, the first Japanese woman to have walked the catwalk in Milan in 1998, the house inaugurated the festivities for its 30th anniversary on Thursday with a very special show organized in the Sempione Park, with the Milan Arena as a backdrop. As the public crowded under the leafy trees lining the catwalk, the models arrived in a very eco-friendly way by tram, dressed in loose-fitting sporty chic dresses, their heads topped with retro hats.

Everything exudes lightness, with its floating nylon overcoats and undulating volumes. For this commemorative collection, the designer, who has settled in Milan after working in retail for major houses such as Prada, returned to her origins with a whole series of black and white pieces, where a few primary colors are gradually inserted. Graphics are very present with geometric lines and patterns.

The knitwear, made in Hong Kong with a remarkable level of finishing, is at the heart of the collection and of Ogino's work. Not to be missed is the other bestseller of the house, the ""wirebag"", offered this season in a mini version. Launched in 1998, this bag made of crocheted plastic threads, washable and infinitely reusable, has become the label's emblem. Attentive to sustainable development, the designer also designed paper seats that the spectators could take away at the end of the show.

Anteprima's turnover is 29.3 million dollars, which does not include licensee revenues. Its top three markets are Japan, where the brand has 11 shops, China and the United States. It is also distributed through some 40 points of sale worldwide, including Milan and Rome, where it has just opened a pop-up shop in the very chic Via Del Babuino.

"Sep 22, 2022","Under the helm of event group N4XT Experiences since last January, LA Fashion Week (LAFW) has announced a new edition next month, scheduled from October 6 to 9.Unveiled a short time ago on the LAFW website, the schedule of the event will start on October 6 with an opening gala, a live entertainment night followed by the first fashion shows whose names have not yet been released. 
 
On the Instagram account of LAFW, N4XT Experiences announced the organization of a ""Fashion week reimagined,"" which will honor ""Fashion, Beauty, Technology and Sustainability.""Founded by Ciarra Pardo, former chief creative officer of Fenty, and artistic director for many artists, from Jay-Z to Rihanna, David Beckham and Snoop Dogg, alongside Imad Izemrane, president and co-founder of Spring Place, N4XT Experiences brought together at its April event at the Peterson Automotive Museum, some 40 emerging designers including Andrew James, Perry Jones, MM Milano, Jimmy Paul or Demobaza.Launched in 1953 by fashion designer Eleanor Lambert, Los Angeles Fashion Week was in turn piloted by several private structures gathering producers, designers and journalists. In the early 2000's, IMG took the lead in producing the Mercedes-Benz-Shows LA at the Standard hotel in Downtown, before partnering with Smashbox Studios. The LA Fashion Awards, created to celebrate California fashion, took over for three years, before a local Downtown organization, BOXeight Fashion Week, organized its own events. 
 
Previously in the hands of Canadian Arthur Chipman, the Los Angeles Fashion Week brand has been run by N4XT Experiences since January. Other events, such as Art Hearts Fashion, which organizes the annual Swim Week, and numerous shows and performances also participate in the celebration of Los Angeles Fashion Week.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 22, 2022","Milan Fashion Week opened its first full day of shows on Wednesday with powerful performances by Fendi, Del Core and Cavalli. An opening day where bodycon fought a duel with bold, modern grandeur.Fendi: Back to the turn of the centuryGot to hand it to Kim Jones. In just a few short seasons, he has established a very clear, modernist style to Fendi, and a highly assured sense of color coordination.Plus, he manages to be highly respectful of the Fendi DNA; riffing on the past even as he marches the brand forward. This season, he triumphantly referenced the house’s own archives, notably playing on clothes that he had seen Delfina Delettrez Fendi wearing.

“Basically, the starting point was looking at collections from 1996 to 2004. It’s what Delfina has been wearing a lot. Silvia’s old clothes, pulled from her wardrobe. And they just look so good, and fresh and modern and that’s what I love,” smiled Jones in a packed backstage.It also helped that Jones’ tailoring was pretty sensational. Crisp suits, cut inside-out with soaring lapels and made in putty gray fine wools. Deconstructed wrap coats finished with satin bands, and a series of satin coats finished at the back with logo Obi belts.

For warm evenings, models look suitably romantic in crepe sheathes finished with diagonal large print logo stripes and embroidered fabric ivy.  

Fendi staged its show inside its Milan show-space on Via Solari.  The set itself was a series of constructivist scaffoldings in lime, candy pink and petrol blue. With several outfits in versions of the latter: mid-calf silk skirts with logo semi sheer tops; mink trim wedge sandals, cargo pocket minis and cashmere sweaters.

What was also instructive is how at ease Jones is referencing his predecessor Karl Lagerfeld, even as he gives Fendi far more commercial kick. All worn by very easily the best casting so far in the international runway season. All done up with bedroom hair and mauve lipstick.

Before the palette went into color-overdrive as the show progressed. 

“Fendi’s color palette is normally pretty natural, and I relate that to the Fendi family. So I wanted to add brights and mix it up, so there are three tones in every look, so they harmonise together,” Jones explained.

In a sense, this was extension of what Kim had been trying in ready-to-wear for fall/winter in February and even in the couture he showed in June. But, this collection packed much more punch.

Jones is also a master of cramming lots of product into a look without overpowering it. He must have sent out at least a dozen gals with two handbags; from hefty tores, to micro alligator bags, and expensive clutches with logo hardware. But, that just came across as clever styling. 

But, above all, one was struck by the pop-color palette seen extensively: in lime green wedge-boots, bag chains, chubby mink clutches and shaven mink sheath cocktails.Cavalli: Big cats in MalibuFausto Puglisi produced fusion fashion with a daring blend of grand Hollywood glamour, regal roll, racy bodycon and signature Cavalli big-cat prints.When the recipe worked, it made for some novel and notable combinations, as if the great screen goddess designer Adrian had encountered the ghost of Roberto Cavalli. Though, this was a dreamy Adrian, who looked like he had smoked something strong, albeit washed down with several glasses of really pricey claret, before he began sketching and draping.

What stood out were the devilishly well-draped fan-shaped cocktails; racier versions of 1930s LA society chic. Or the black-and-white moiré coats with leopard-skin lining. Anchored by tiger-pattern flats. Sicily-meets-Santa Monica, with a dash of Charles James rolled in.

Fausto also dreamed up some rather risqué mega plissé skirts, then combined them with hot pants and a leather bra. Though his Cavalli gal will always be a rocker at heart - with the guts and chutzpah to appear in cheetah-print minis combined with white patent-leather bras; leg-of-mutton silk sleeves and piratical, ecru leather boots.

Ultimately, Puglisi’s customer is more rockstar that Tony winner, proud to prowl the stage in mega pleated cheetah-pattern minis and leather bustiers.

In his program notes, Puglisi spoke of the influence of Hitchcock and his disturbing cine noir, though backstage he seemed more concerned by the upcoming Italian parliamentary elections, where the favourite to win is the extreme right wing rabble rouser Giorgia Meloni. She has called for the forcible repatriation of immigrants and the banning of adoption by gay parents, not exactly a popular position in the fashion community. Come to think of it in many communities.

“I’m really afraid of these elections. We really risk a lot. It’s all about violence, it’s all about ugliness. So, I was thinking of Marnie from Hitchcock, and it reminded me of my first years in New York, when I met Joyce Ma and she told me about Tony Duquette, who became my first artistic obsession,” explained Fausto post-show.

Famed for his Hollywood renaissance style, decorator par excellence Duquette was noted for recycling plants, sets and objects into his unique LA home.

Rather like Puglisi and his recycling of concepts, though with new moiré and silk materials, to impact a certain magnificence to this mash-up mode.
 Del Core: Couture encounters bodyconAn eclectic, but ultimately very convincing collection from Del Core; the nearest thing one gets to haute-couture in Milan’s women’s ready-to-wear seasons.A collection of contrasts beginning with floral jacquard suits cut with icy precision and ending with a couple of stunning evening gowns in red crochet; bias cut gauzy crepe or golden lemon sequins. The latter topped by white bugle beads.

“I was thinking about emerging myself in the ocean. I really like that idea. Also of something more fluid, easier, lighter and exploring a diverse woman,” said designer Daniel Del Core, adding that the sequin look was designed to suggest it was coral topped.

In between came some very gutsy bodycon ideas; from cut-out posh punk bodystockings, to pencil pants suits, to a series of really great flared loose-weave knitted pants.

“I really like Helmut Newton and that was where I started. A simplicity to the collection with sharpness, yet in wildlife colours,” smiled Del Core

"Sep 21, 2022","The countdown is on. Five, four, three, two, one! A siren sounds. The packed Allianz Cloud sports hall in Milan holds its breath. The show can begin, offering, as Diesel had promised, ""a truly democratic fashion show"" to the almost 5,000 spectators, including the company's teams; students from fashion schools and, above all, 3,000 members of the general public who had come to discover the brand's spring-summer 2023 collection on Wednesday.
 The first mannequins enter the arena at full speed, bypassing the giant inflatable dolls (the largest inflatable structure in the world, according to the house), which tumbled to the centre of the stage, extending their arms and legs like disproportionate tentacles towards the stands. The silhouettes look almost tiny, making up Diesel's cool new tribe.
 
The elaborate collection reviews the thousand-and-one ways of dressing in denim, and above all the countless possibilities offered by denim through all sorts of treatments, washes, dyes, special prints, textural effects and finishes. The palette ranges from a faded ash-blue to a yellow-white, to the darker notes of grey, black and brown, before exploding into bright orange and pink.Trousers, jackets, tops, mini and maxi skirts, coats, but also suits, leggings and sweaters and even santiags and stiletto boots with pockets, strictly in denim; nothing is missing. Creative director Glenn Martens takes last season's wardrobe and elevates it to a new level with a virtuoso touch of madness.
 
The garments are full of details and surprises, such as denim dresses treated in the manner of devoured velvet, extended with an embroidery effect in a transparent organza veil, or a denim coat with a wide neckline, whose bushy fringed edges are reminiscent of the fur edges of glamorous coats. Elsewhere, ensembles are completely slashed with a cutter, forming thin strips between the garment's seams, offering an ultra-chic version of ripped denim. 
Diesel's Belgian designer continues the experimentation that is so dear to him and that made his Y/Project brand famous. He has no equal for playing with the most unexpected constructions. For example, a coat made of 15,000 Diesel tags aged and brushed or a pair of jeans stretched upwards to form a corset.

Blue canvas squares are assembled as they are, leaving the excess fabric along the sleeves and legs, undulating like ruffles. The belt wraps from the waist to the bust in a single movement. Sometimes it spirals around the upper body to form a top, while a belted long jacket becomes a ""trompe l'oeil"" miniskirt jacket.

""Glenn is not a stylist, he is a couturier. He's managed to do something totally new by putting the 44-year history of Diesel into this collection. He has managed to transform our DNA into something extraordinary,"" enthused Renzo Rosso, the brand's founder and chairman of the OTB fashion group, on the sidelines of the show.

""I have passed the baton to a very special person. With him, the brand is living a great moment,"" he said.

"Sep 21, 2022","Pantone has released a new trend report for SS23 to coincide with London Fashion Week with the global colour specialist saying the season will “chart a new path forward”.Its palette of predictions features 10 “standout” colours and five classics that “blend our need for high-spirited energy and dynamic vibrancy with colours that comfort and provide a calm space”.

“Recontextualised with a modern edge, this season’s colours integrate tradition and innovation marrying our need for brightness and vibrant positivity with quieting tinted tones,” it said. “A fearless attitude and freedom of expression reframes our perceptions of colour with a no-holds-barred approach coming through in witty mixes and animated pairings”.What that means in practice is a focus on brights for the trend palette, but also a blend of softer tones.

They include Pantone 17-1563 Cherry Tomato, “a tempting red that calls out for attention”; 16-1544 Persimmon, “a silky honey shaded coral”; 14-1140 Iced Mango, a fruity orange “with a tropical touch”; 12-0643 Blazing Yellow, a “heated radiant beam of sunshine”; 16-0229 Titanite, an “enlivening and lustrous yellow green”; 16-6230 Andean Toucan, an “exotic green suggestive of the highland forest”; 14-4122 Airy Blue, a lightweight blue “illustrative of a cloudless sky”; 18-4245 Electric Blue Lemonade, a “crisp brilliant blue that electrifies the palette”; 17-3020 Spring Crocus, a floral purple that “blithely blooms in early spring”; and 16-2122 Pink Cosmos, a garden pink that “promotes contrast to all other hues”.

Meanwhile, the classic palette features “ultra-calm tints and tones [that] suggest a quiet presence”.

That means 13-4201 Oyster Mushroom, “a non-presumptive grey with a silent power”; 14-6011 Grayed Jade, a mineralised greyed green tone”; 12-0912 Tender Peach, a “delicate peach with a gentle touch”; 17-1230 Mocha Mousse, a “sweet milk chocolate brown”; and 19-3954 Bluing, a “brisk inky blue”.

Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute, said: “As we anticipate our future, we are embracing the freedom to colourfully express our individuality without constraint. Experiencing a creative liberation that transgresses previous norms, we are adapting and inventing novel pairings and contrasting harmonies.” Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 21, 2022","Georgia will once again become the epicenter of culture and alternative fashion. Between November 3 and 7, its capital city will host an innovative cultural event at Factory Tbilisi, a cultural space that was formerly a Coca-Cola factory and has recently been refurbished as the location for the capital's fashion week.The event is organized by fashion expert Sofia Tchkonia, founder of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Tbilisi, together with collector Eugene Bereznitsky, creator of the Kyiv Art Week International Festival and the Kyiv Art Fair, and art specialist and promoter of Ukrainian culture Serge Kerbitskyi.

Along the lines of the last Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Tbilisi and the Kyiv Fashion & Arts Days, an event dedicated to fashion and design organized in the Ukrainian capital a few months before the outbreak of the war, this newly created event will weave alliances between artistic fields with the aim of supporting Ukrainian culture and creativity. The concept is none other than to present a creative breeding ground for artists, designers, musicians, art curators and international media professionals to ""showcase the importance of freedom, democratic values and truth"". It should be noted that Georgia has been suffering the consequences of the Russian invasion since 2008.Although the official list of participants has not yet been announced, there are already some confirmed names such as The Quatro ballet, Ukrainian electro-acoustic group DZ'OB BAND, Tbilisi-based queer art collective Fungus and Ukrainian artist Arsen Savadov.

""The brutal and merciless war raging in the heart of Europe is much more than a quest for new territories: it is a battle of opposing ideologies, of tyranny and freedom, of past and future, of darkness and light. As culture is a sword of light that has been at the center of social changes throughout history, the event's goal is to talk about the painful reality of the present, in which we continue to fight against colonialism and imperialism,"" said the organizers of the event, which will be unveiling its final official calendar in the coming weeks.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 20, 2022","New entries, household names, entertainment and glamour: Milan Fashion Week Women, starting on Tuesday September 20 and ending on September 26, is ready to throw down the gauntlet to the vibrant fashion week season opener that has recently wrapped up in New York. The Milan womenswear week promises to be uber-exciting indeed, featuring a host of special events, new names and designers, major come-backs and, for the first time, several shows open to the public. Beginning with Diesel which, under the aegis of creative director Glenn Martens, will welcome more than 7,000 people at the Allianz Cloud Arena on Wednesday 21.In the same spirit, the next day, the show by Anteprima, the Japanese label by Izumi Ogino that is celebrating its 30th anniversary, will be open to the public at the Arena di Milano stadium. Prada has invited to its show the customers of its latest NFT collection, and Philosophy by Lorenzo Serafini has done the same for the five winners of an Instagram competition staged by the label. Not to mention the event scheduled from September 20 to 24 by German e-tailer About You, with shows open to the general public.

The calendar of this edition of Milan Fashion Week, dedicated to the Spring/Summer 2023 women’s ready-to-wear collections, includes no fewer than 210 events, as opposed to 170 in February, with 68 runway shows (seven of them in digital format), 111 presentations and some 30 parallel events. Milan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala said that “this fashion week is a breath of fresh air for Milan, certainly the city’s central event in September.”There will also be a number of off-calendar shows and presentations, with the vast majority of events concentrated over the course of five days, from Wednesday to Sunday. In other words, a super intense programme, which is kicking off on Tuesday with a focus on young designers, with Milano Moda Graduate, a collective show by students from the top fashion schools, and with the opening of the Fashion Hub by the Italian Fashion Chamber, showcasing a selection of emerging Italian designers as well as various projects, including Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion, Budapest Select, Designer for the Planet and Hope Fashion Ukraine, an initiative in favour of Ukrainian designers.

All the household names of Italian fashion are featured on the calendar, with Fendi and Roberto Cavalli showing on Wednesday, Max Mara, Prada and Moschino on Thursday, Tod’s and Versace on Friday, Dolce & Gabbana and Trussardi on Saturday, and Giorgio Armani on Sunday. Notable absentees are Marni, which this season chose to show in New York, Ambush, which made its first Milanese appearance last season, Palm Angels and Plein Sport.
 
Italy’s fashion capital is instead welcoming the return of several big names, such as Antonio Marras, whose label was recently bought by the Calzedonia group and will stage the opening show on Wednesday morning, as well as German label Boss on Thursday and Moncler, which will fête its 70th anniversary on Saturday. The latter two had given the February edition a miss. Also making their comeback are Vivetta and Stella Jean, who is back in Milan after several seasons, hosting at her show six designers from minority groups with the ""We are made in Italy"" collective.Among the highly anticipated comebacks, that of Salvatore Ferragamo, enjoying a revival under the aegis of new boss Marco Gobetti. The Ferragamo show is scheduled on Saturday in the historic building once home to the Milan Archbishopric’s seminary, where the label will soon open its third luxury hotel. It will be a chance to discover the first collection by Maximilian Davis, the young British designer of Afro-Caribbean origin now head of style at the distinguished Florentine label.

This new season is a time of creative rejuvenation for some of Italy’s long-established fashion names. Like Ferragamo, others have turned over a new leaf, putting a new generation of designers in charge. Four of these labels will be showing in Milan, like Missoni and Etro on Friday. Filippo Grazioli, previously at Margiela, Hermès, Givenchy and Burberry, has taken over at the former from Angela Missoni, while Marco de Vincenzo, known for his own label and his work on accessories at Fendi, has succeeded Kean and Veronica Etro.Rhuigi Villaseñor debuts for BallyAnother highlight will be Bally's first-ever runway show. The Swiss premium footwear brand will debut on the Milanese runways on Saturday, unveiling the collection by new creative director Rhuigi Villaseñor, the Californian designer of Filipino origin who founded the Rhude label. Also not to be missed, on the presentations calendar, the Benetton show on Sunday, introducing the first collection by Andrea Incontri, an Italian designer who has notably worked at Tod’s and has taken over from Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.

Among the young designers staging their maiden Milanese shows, Matty Bovan, British fashion’s rising star, who will show on Sunday backed by Dolce & Gabbana, while three new names will present their collections digitally on Monday: Durazzi Milano by designer Ilenia Durazzi, and two South African labels, MmusoMaxwell, founded in 2016 by Maxwell Boko and Mmuso Potsane, winner of the innovation award at the 2022 Woolmark Prize, and Viviers, launched in 2019 by Lezanne Viviers, who worked for eight years with South African fashion icon Marianne Fassler. Other Milan rookies on the presentations calendar include Mtof, Themoirè, Lisa von Tang, Sara Roka, VI Valentina Ilardi, Yume Yume, Charles Philip, Vernisse and Pina G.

This sparkling edition of Milan Fashion Week will of course feature after-show parties, gala evenings, dinners and store inaugurations, and also the opening of three photography exhibitions, dedicated to Richard Avedon, Max Vadukul and Giovanni Gastel. The week will end in style with the award ceremony for the Oscars of ecological fashion, the CNMI Sustainable Fashion Awards, at the La Scala opera house.

"Sep 20, 2022","It’s been a busy week for Stephen Jones, London’s most influential milliner, whose hats are much in demand for this week's memorials for Queen Elizabeth II.Jones entire store in Covent Garden has been given over to black hats - from classic trilby or classy cloches; to refined fascinators and, of course, bowlers.

“Everyone has been by,” explained Jones, as he greeted editors in for London Fashion Week at a presentation of his latest collection in his boutique. Jones remained discreet about which members of the nobility were his clients. Though one could easily spot his creations at services in both Edinburgh and London this past week.

His inspiration for next spring was Morocco from a Moorish fez with tassel to Beau Geste kepi with sun flaps at the back.

“After not being able to travel, I wanted to go back to one of the first foreign countries I visited, Morocco. That’s where I met Jean-Paul Gaultier, and we began working together, which started a whole lot of visits to Paris,” Jones recalled.

Gaultier actually recognised Jones from his appearance in the iconic pop video, 'Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?' by Boy George, where he appears as a posh fan.

His latest trip to Marrakech led to beautiful tulle headbands, sculpted Brâncuși-style, to arty mini hijabs and caps made of thin strips of straw over a tulle structure.“It’s nice to be able to work on the road,” smiled Jones, attired in all-black, including tie and lightly crumpled Commes des Garçons calico jacket. 

“That way you don’t have to worry about ironing!” He chuckled.

Jones also played with raffia, using it to trim a trilby, bucket hats and corporal caps worthy of a hipster Gary Cooper. While travelling, Jones continues to work, cutting and trimming canvas into fresh shapes on a small wooden head, as he finds inspiration from local culture and nature. Like a marvellous petrol blue leaf shaped hat, whose half-sized prototype he showed proudly. 

Back in the 80s, Jones was a 'Blitz Kid', a 'New Romantic' who hung out with Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and Isabella Blow; and shared a home with Boy George and Grayson Perry. He would go to be-hat the likes of Grace Jones, Diana Ross, Madonna and Bryan Ferry, among many many others.

At 65, Jones is very much an institution, and still very much in demand. He began working with Christian Dior when John Galliano took over creative control in the mid-nineties and still works with both Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones at Dior today. 

Next week will find him in Milan, where he creates hats and headgear for both Jeremy Scott at Moschino and Boss.

But on Monday, his remarkable skill at sculpting hats into objects of refinement will be evident at Westminster Abbey.

"Sep 20, 2022","From September 20 to 25, the biggest names in Italian luxury will gather in Milan to present their Spring/Summer 2023 collections. German fashion online retailer About You will also unconventionally participate in this event with a series of 17 fashion shows held in the Italian fashion capital starting this Tuesday.

The e-tailer, which recorded a 48% increase in sales in 2021 to €1.73 billion, is taking its 'open to the public' fashion week concept to Milan, after already being previously tested in Berlin. The organizers expect more than 8,000 people to attend over a five-day period, with an audience consisting of a mix of VIP guests, influencers and fashion lovers in a festival-like affair. For the occasion, About You teamed up with the creative agency Villa Eugénie and created its AYFW Village in the large Zona Farini, north of Milan, in a space of over 15,000 square meters filled with containers. On site, the villa is anchored by a 20-meter-high tower made up of screens arranged in a circle.

The e-tailer and its brands, as well as partner labels, will offer experiences to visitors, with the aim of allowing content creators, particularly with a space entirely dedicated to TikTok, to convey the atmosphere of the event designed as a big party mixing fashion, art and music. After the inaugural About You fashion show on Tuesday, presentations of the website's brands will follow one another throughout the week, as well as renowned brands such as G-Star, Adidas by Stella McCartney, Hugo and Puma. Julian Jansen, content director of the retailer, elaborates on the ambitious goals of this first About You Fashion Week in Milan.FashionNetwork.com: When and how was the concept of About You Fashion Week born?

Julian Jansen: We launched the idea of About You Fashion Week three years ago. We have seen, in Berlin and at other Fashion Weeks, that fashion week events are always very exclusive, that they are reserved for VIP guests and influencers, and that normal people are not usually invited to attend. We wanted to democratize this somehow. We had to focus on fashion and models, of course, but transform it into a very entertaining show. So we started the project with the slogan 'Exclusive for everyone' in the first edition during Berlin Fashion Week where anyone could attend, sit in the front row, next to an influencer or a VIP guest. It was really great. The second Fashion Week was during the pandemic. It was 100% digital, but it was also a huge fashion show. And last year, again in Berlin, we started working with Villa Eugénie and we held eight branded runway shows in Berlin.FNW: What lessons did you learn from these first sessions?

JJ: The most important thing is that, for us, these events are much more than models walking down a runway. We are retailers. When we, or even Adidas, present new products, you can't compare it to a Chanel, Celine or Gucci show. We don't want to play in that field. We want to put ourselves on a more personal level with our show. What we realized quite quickly is that we have a lot more freedom than others, that the shows can be fun with dancers, singers, and performers. The important thing is also to get the audience to come to the different shows. Influencers and VIP guests are important. It's great to have a perfect mix between a demographic of cool people and regular people. You have to be able to successfully balance this. Of course, you need your VIP guests, like Bella Hadid. You need influencers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany. And you need a bunch of cool kids to come to party, bring good vibes and have fun to liven up the atmosphere for all attendees.

FNW: Why did you leave Berlin this year?

JJ: We always wanted to bring this dimension of fashion to About You. And since we are in the midst of expanding our business internationally, we wanted to be able to have a presence in one of the major fashion capitals. It made a lot of sense to go to Milan because Italy is one of the key markets we would like to develop in. We have our About You show which opens the fashion week and that will be quite exclusive, with 600 VIP guests, partners and influencers. And the other 16 shows will be less exclusive with an audience of 300 to 400 people.

FNW: This opening to the general public reminds me of what one of your competitors, Zalando, did with the Bread&Butter festival in Berlin?

JJ: Zalando created this event for the general public. But I think the big difference is that we created our Fashion Week ourselves and did not take over an existing concept. This means we have our own unique vibe, our own DNA. It has a really different approach; Bread&Butter was originally a B2B event. We do things our own way from start to finish. It's really about people that we allow to have this encounter.

FNW: Brands such as Adidas, Hugo and Puma are participating in this 2022 edition. What are your agreements with them?

JJ: About You was created eight years ago and since then we have around 2,500 brands that have joined us. We have a very strong relationship with these brands, especially with the bigger ones. This means that our business relationship with them is solid. And most of them are interested in our activations, especially in our IRL (real world) projects, since few brands do things like that. So we know which brands we'd like to move forward with and invite them to participate. And most allocate their marketing budgets a year in advance and contact us for a spot in our program. But there are only 16 slots. It's still a commercial relationship and about working together on the runway shows.

FNW: How do you establish a strong link between the activation and the business behind it on the website?

JJ: We build sales periods around great stories like this. We have the best conversion rates when we have this type of activation like About You Fashion Week. We also have influencer and social media activity that attracts more customers or live shopping that helps with conversion.

FNW: Do you live stream the event on your website?

JJ: Actually, we did the first year. We don't want to do it anymore and we won't do it anymore. It's actually bad for the hype. When you live stream this type of event, it isn't as special for the consumer watching the show. We did it the first year and it didn't work. It's very complicated to capture the public's attention for 10 or 15 minutes of a fashion show. Instead, we are permanently live via the influencers who post or film their experience. These are strong personalities that bring the event to life in their community. Sometimes they also take over our channel. And that's what really generates FOMO (fear of missing out) and fuels interest in the event. But this requires one-minute interactions at most.

FNW: So no one watches the full runway shows?

JJ: Very few people are interested in fashion at this level. Instead, 24 hours after the shows we have videos showing the event with the runway show, the concurrent events, the celebrities present. It's more filmed like a show. We also shoot on secondary sets where we highlight the models. It's more like a film that allows us to present the brands.

FNW: What about live shopping? Is this a first for you?

JJ: We tried it last season, especially for our own brands. We have more than 60 today, mostly with celebrities like Kendall Jenner, but many others who are celebrities or influencers from Germany, Italy, etc. They are 45-minute sessions with these people, who highlight their pieces presented in fashion shows or the 'best' of their collection.

FNW: What do these private labels developed with VIPs represent in your business?

JJ: Last year we had 26, so it is a business segment that is growing very rapidly. Our goal is to partner with the most important international celebrities to offer these collections with us. We will present some of them at our Fashion Week. Of the 16 brands, nine are our own brands. These brands represent a double-digit share of our business as a whole, while, I remind you that we have a portfolio of 2,500 brands.

FNW: From a business standpoint, what do you expect from such an event?

JJ: About You Fashion Week is a whole experience. We will certainly have some pieces on special offer on our website, but that's not the point at all. The idea is rather to allow people to discover these pieces. And it's very interesting for us to break into the Italian market. We are going to have this event in person and Milan's networks, but we will also push it with a poster campaign, a TV campaign, etc. We want to share our brand identity with Italians and we want to do it in our own way. It also allows us to have international visibility during this week when all eyes are on Milan. It's the perfect place to spread our message.

FNW: But aren't you afraid to compete with big luxury houses during this period?

JJ: We are here to present ourselves. And we are very strong in this field, to explain who we are. We are distributors; we are not here to compare ourselves with luxury players. We are here to bring Fashion Week to normal people, to people who want to have fun.

FNW: How many people do you want to reach exactly?

JJ: I think during the last Fashion Week we surpassed the one billion mark in networking contacts. We want to reach a lot more this year. But I'm feeling very optimistic about it.

FNW: And after that, do you plan to set up shop in Milan or potentially bring the concept to Paris or even New York?

JJ: We would like to expand the concept. We are open to new destinations. Unlike traditional Fashion Weeks, we are not tied to any one city or country. The first year it was Berlin, this year Milan and next year it could be New York, London, Paris or any of our target markets. We are like a big circus that travels the world!

FNW: What is the budget for such a project?

JJ: I can tell you that it's more than a million euros.... More seriously, it is, of course, a substantial investment. But the impact is far greater than simply having a campaign in one country. The financial support of the brands involved in the fashion shows, as well as the players involved in the Village, makes all of this possible.

"Sep 19, 2022","The future Gel-Lyte III CM 1.95 sneakers by Asics, which will be commercialised in autumn 2023, could be no other colour but white. For the Japanese sportswear brand, launching this model, named after one of its most famous pair of sneakers, is a strong statement of intent in terms of sustainable innovation. According to Asics in fact, the new model will have the market's lowest carbon footprint, emitting only 1.95 kg of CO2 per pair over its entire life cycle.On average, according to various studies, a pair of sneakers produced in Asia and sold in Europe has a carbon footprint of approximately 14 kg. Asics would therefore be able to take a major step forward in an environmentally friendly direction with this model. Hence the choice of making the new shoes, which are expected to be emissions-free by 2050, available in a lily-white colourway.

Asics stated that this model is the result of a combination of several R&D strands, including work undertaken in conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010, on how to measure a product’s CO2 impact over its full life cycle.“Following that previous study, published in 2012, Asics has developed innovative ways to reduce the impact of manufacturing, to use materials more efficiently, and to substitute new, lower impact materials,” said the MIT scientists who have worked on this project. “Furthermore, we are impressed by the ways in which Asics has refined and extended the methods for assessing product CO2 emissions. Asics has extended, in both breadth and depth, data collection pertaining to CO2 assessment. We sincerely hope that this study and its findings will encourage other firms to begin the journey to understand the impacts of their products and, therefore, to move towards a more sustainable footwear industry,” they added.

To achieve this goal, Asics has had to rethink the shoes' assembly and materials composition.“Among the sneaker’s series of innovations is a new carbon negative foam, which features as part of its midsole and sockliner,” Asics stated in the press release. The foam, called Septon Bio and produced by the Kuraray company, is made from a fusion of bio-sourced polymers derived in part from sugar cane.

“Other key design details in the shoe include the use of recycled and solution-dyed polyester in the main upper material and the sockliner mesh. The shoe features a new structure utilizing tape that enables less material usage, and 100% renewable energy is used throughout the manufacturing phase,” added Asics.

The brand intends to use only recycled polyester by 2030, and is therefore developing a much more sustainable product range.

"Sep 16, 2022","Californian sustainable sneakers brand Allbirds has announced the launch of the ‘Plant Pacer’, a sneakers model made with 100% plastic-free plant leather.A novelty that follows in the wake of various other sustainable materials already adopted by Allbirds, from extra-fine New Zealand merino wool to eucalyptus fibre mesh and the sugarcane-based ‘SweetFoam’, used for making shoe soles.
 
Plant Leather has been developed in partnership with materials innovation company Natural Fiber Welding. It is a unique material for the footwear sector, “a truly durable alternative leather, 100% plastic-free, 100% vegan, which contains only natural materials such as rubber and vegetable oils, and agricultural by-products such as rice husk and citrus peel,” as Allbirds stated in a press release. “For way too long, fashion companies have relied on dirty synthetics and unsustainable leather, putting established ways of doing things and costs before the environment. We wanted to put an end to that, which led us to create the Plant Pacer,” said Tim Brown, co-founder and co-CEO of Allbirds. “Through the innovative use of natural materials, like Plant Leather and others, we’re going to continue stretching the limits of sustainable footwear,” he added.The launch of Plant Leather-based sneakers underscores Allbirds’s desire to extend its presence in the lifestyle footwear category. With the Plant Pacer and its canvas version, the Canvas Pacer, Allbirds is adding to its range of more contemporary models. 
  
In recent years, Allbirds has teamed up with style icons such as Jeff Staple and Rosie Assoulin, as well as developed shoes with a very low carbon footprint with Adidas, and expanded its retail footprint with partners like Nordstrom and Selfridges. In addition to which the brand has invested with partners like NFW to create innovative materials, “to demonstrate that sustainability and style are not incompatible,” said Brown.

"Sep 14, 2022","Usain Bolt staged his victory gesture in New York late Tuesday night, but on a Puma catwalk near Wall Street, and not on a race track.The Olympic champion took the final passage at the German active sports brand’s Futrograde event, an immersive blend of runway show, digital display and multi-collab unveiling.

Bolt appearing in a black and white tracksuit, except the jacket had morphed into a gentlemanly sporting evening tailcoat. Throwing his hands in the air as he exited the catwalk to ignite a huge burst of applause by the audience inside 25 Broadway, a soaring first-class waiting room for pre-WWII passenger liners so grand that several Puma fans said it reminded them of the Sistine Chapel.Usain’s runway date: Winnie Harlow, vamping it up in an all-black crystal-encrusted track top and a Marie Antoinette-worthy sporty crinoline.

Parallel to its fashion fete, Puma had launched a metaverse experience entitled Black Station, offering exclusive NFTs with limited edition physical sneakers. A 3D canvas, Black Station will provide web3 activations throughout the coming months.

Evoked by giant screens running along the walls of the show space, the brand’s greatest football ambassador Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. even made an appearance, albeit in a 3D digital projection on the flanking screens, scanned weeks before the show.

All sorts of fashion fantasies populated this show, including a giant inflated flesh bubble woman, her back finished with Puma's signature leaping panther. While two troupes of dancers in tech-stretch looks fought mock West-Side-stories battles spasmodically on the elevated runway. 

Although the main action was on the catwalk, opening with a downtown section focusing on sustainable streetwear, rifling through an array of partnerships - from the AC Milan football team and Dapper Dan tailored looks to collabs with hipster designers like Palomo Spain and Koché, whose founder Christelle Kocher sat front-row.Boasting very much the youngest audience of New York Fashion Week, many of which shows tend to be populated with elderly socialites, Puma hosted Brooklyn Beckham, Cindy Bruno, Christian Combs, Joey Badass and Remi Bader, along with Skepta.

Post-show, the UK rapper staged a dynamic performance on stage, elaborately choreographed, while a series entitled Luxe Sport featured great sinful red leather track pants and suits; tech dusters and flamenco dresses and chunky thigh-boots with uber-wide side stripes.

“We wanted to show a wide spectrum of stories and New York has the open arms to welcome that sort of idea. To speak about the archives, the future, technology and our links to streetwear culture,” explained Heiko Desens, Puma’s global creative director.The brand is also very adept at adapting its offer for local markets. A prime example was a series of natty sporty hijabs, sure to find a huge audience in the Gulf where women love to wear the headgear with logos. Desens’ design team occasionally went into overdrive with brilliant deconstructed assemblages of puffers and racing gear that recalled Comme des Garçons or Junya Watanabe.

Puma will celebrate its 75th anniversary next year, and this show was also a brilliant exposition of its DNA with a twist. Like logo-print stretch ice racer suits; its iconic form-stripe sneakers; or great new gothic-soled loafers dreamed up by Palomo Spain designer Alejandro Palomo.

“I love the way Puma has created this fashion identity that is so different from other sports brands,” commented Palomo, who joined hundreds of the audience on the catwalk when it turned into a post-show dance floor. 

Given this powerful performance, little wonder Puma has bounced back so quickly from the pandemic. Sales soared 30% in 2021 to €6.805 billion. 

Quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 1986, Puma’s main shareholder is the Kering group and the Pinault family's investment company, Artemis.

"Sep 14, 2022","After taking over the Place de l'Opera in Paris last year, Etam has set its sights on the gardens of the National Archives in Paris for the 15th edition of its annual lingerie fashion show. The lingerie brand has scheduled this live runway show on September 27, the day immediately following the kick-off of Paris Fashion Week. The boundaries between virtual and reality will be explored during this event, of which musical guests have not yet been revealed.""Gloss and matte. Transparency and opacity. Our creative studio is reinterpreting duality by designing the inception of hybrid lingerie,"" said the brand, which will unveil haute-couture pieces embroidered by the Potencier maison.

The models' makeup looks will be done by Tom Sapin, make-up artist of M.A.C Cosmetics.During the show, which will be broadcast live online at 9 p.m., the brand's customers will be able to buy the pieces instantly as part of a live shopping experience. The show will also be broadcast on television on the TMC channel.

By playing with the ties between reality and the virtual, the brand will equip some of the fashion show's spectators with smart 'Ray-Ban Stories' eyeglasses, which will give them a behind-the-scenes look at the event.

As for its swimwear fashion show, which was held on a beach in Corsica in May 2022, Etam will be offering NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for sale. Five couture bodysuits from the show will be reproduced into 50 limited-edition virtual copies.

""These unique pieces will be accompanied by their virtual avatar and will give their purchaser VIP access to many perks and VIP experiences,"" said the brand, which made its debut in the U.S. last March.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 13, 2022","Sports brand Fila is continuing to tap global creatives for a series of collaborations and on Tuesday it announced a link-up with Paris-based designer Haider Ackermann.The company said it “keeps pushing boundaries, nurturing unexpected collaborations and surprising couplings that further extend its field of action” and this latest move supports that approach.

Ackermann is known for his elegant and unusual cuts and his strong sense of colour. Fila said the pairing of the two labels makes for “a decidedly unexpected, hence exciting, coupling”.The menswear, womenswear and accessories offer will be unveiled in one of the UK’s most fashion focused cities via a fashion show in Manchester on Thursday, November 17.

Recent Fila collabs have included Y/Project and Oliver Spencer.

Haider Ackermann said of the latest development: “I was extremely surprised when I was contacted by Fila with the idea to collaborate. Unknown things make my heart beat faster, because I believe in the power of the unexpected, so I willingly took on the challenge. In visiting the extensive Fila archives I was struck by how elegant sportsmen were on the playing field back in the day. My aim is to elaborate on that, keeping the feeling of unexpectedness that is so important for me.”

And Fila chairman Gene Yoon added: “I’ve always admired Haider Ackermann’s creativity. Giving him the possibility to dive into our archives in Biella opened an unprecedented creative landscape for the brand. Haider Ackermann’s fashion DNA merged with the Fila heritage in sports is a hyper-contemporary combination that represents the latest evolution of Fila to be forefront in sports, style and fashion.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 13, 2022","A floral motif is a spring perennial but ebbs and flows in fashion. For Spring 2023, the tap was turned on the full spigot. Three New York collections, each shown in an iconic New York location, demonstrated how uniquely the enduring motif can be interpreted. Fur and eveningwear master Dennis Basso toasted his 40th-anniversary collection while Ulla Johnson and LoveShackFancy designer Rebecca Hessel Cohen aptly channeled their brand ethos through the collection presentation.Dennis BassoBackstage before his 40th-anniversary collection, Dennis Basso momentarily shifted his focus from the interview he was doing for FashionNetwork.com with this reporter to a jeans and T-shirt clad man and his pre-teen son in shorts and polo. The two show novices had wandered backstage instead of to the show venue. It's this same uncanny sense of knowing who and who doesn't belong in a space that Basso applies to his elegantly dressed women these past four decades. He knows what they should wear and where they should be wearing them.In this case, he sees his woman wearing the clothes to spring and summer garden parties, explicitly calling out his lavish Watermill garden (front row guest Martha Stewart told FashionNetwork.com that her ""garden is bigger, but Dennis' is fancier"").

""Evening is my thing. How would they dress for these amazing evenings Newport, Palm Beach, Nantucket, or Watermill,"" said Basso.He answered this question with the wispy, light-as-air creations, which featured hand-embroidered tulle, crystals and marabou, flirty chiffon numbers, and a dramatic pink satin strapless gown with a flowing train as a finale. Bright white ensembles in a slinky mini-dress or strong evening pants looked especially great on lovely dark-skinned models. And if that garden has a spring chill, a fur shrug, an intricate fur wrap, or bolero over a slip dress were the antidote.

Guest at the newly remodeled Pierre Ballroom was not only the legions of fans he's dressed over the year but famous ones along with Stewart, such as Kris Jenner, Candace Bushnell, 70s supermodel Carol Alt, Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, Ashley Longshore, Rosanna Scotto, Star Jones, and shoe designer Brian Atwood. Prior to the show start, Jenner sidled up next to pal Ocleppo Hilfiger, copped to being dressed in Good American but there in solidarity regardless. ""But listen, we're here,"" gesturing to Ocleppo dressed in Tommy Hilfiger, ""we are going to support Dennis.""

Women like those in the front row have been the designer's bread and butter out of the gate.

""I had no clue. I wanted to be in the fashion industry, so my father helped me set up a little company, and the next thing I knew, I was having a fashion show at the Regency Hotel. It was a new world. Ivana Trump came, and so did Leba Sedaka and Egon and DVF. The best thing was The New York Times gave me a great review and coverage, putting me on the map right out of the gate,"" he recalled.

He quipped when asked if the metaverse suited Dennis Basso's designs.

""I am still trying to figure out the universe, let alone the metaverse,"" adding, ""I'm an old school guy with a ledger date book, but my designs are modern.""LoveShackFancyCreative director Rebecca Hessel Cohen of LoveShackFancy is a modern woman who revamps retro precious design tropes that channel one's inner Elle Woods, Stevie Nicks and Cinderella all at once into an infectious travel lifestyle brand stocked with fun, frothy party frocks ripe with bows, ruffles, and beading, plus signature cotton Victorian dresses are given a contemporary spin.(Though this season, she pointed to a pink lightweight tweed and matching jacket and hot pink tailored suit and insisted her girl can go to the office too.)

One apt way to describe the brand launched in 2013 would be LoveShackFancy picks up where Gunne Sax (for those old enough to recall) and Betsey Johnson left off.

She staged her rollicking Spring 2023 presentation in what she calls her backyard, aka Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum grounds.

""I grew up across the street; I went to Nightingale, and my kids go there now, and the young generation inspired me,"" she said at a lavish garden party that she hosted for press, buyers but most importantly, her friends and fans of the brand. Safe to say, LoveShackFancy could boast the most guests dressed in the brand.

Given they've already opened 14 stores, 12 during the pandemic, and one more on the way in London in December, her first international boutique, it appears Hessel Cohen hit the zeitgeist, that was craving nostalgia once again, on the head.Ulla JohnsonMeanwhile, in Brooklyn, for her Spring 2023 collection, the designer again explored how far her and her team can push the level of her contemporary dress-based collection. The outing proved multiple intricacies could be achieved this side of couture. It didn't hurt either that is was shown at the worth-the-trip Beaux-Arts Court at the Brooklyn Museum strewn with elaborate floral designs covering the floor.Backstage, Johnson told reporters that she and her team were pleased with how far they took craft into the highly detailed collection this season.

“One look was entirely handknit from silk ribbon, another hand-crocheted, another hand-loomed by artisan cooperatives in Guatemala, women in Bangalore hand-printed Shibori silks. There was so much handwork in the collection, and keeping this work alive during the past few years has been challenging. It’s so exciting to start working with these communities we had trouble accessing in the past two years,” she explained, noting the hammered-brass jewelry was made by artisans in Kenya.

Some of the artisans were stateside, such as in Los Angeles, where artisans used antique chain stitch machinery on the denim style, was Johnson referred to as her tailored offerings. New York is home to three master crocheters. “It was a joint effort, and some of those pieces had five different people working on them,” she continued.

Of the themes and motifs, there were many. Johnson cited meditating about the connectedness to nature and the synergy with nature. (Hence, the floral-strewn runway and reclaimed wood stools for guests will be composted and reused, respectively.)

The work of artists such as Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, and Bryan Lavelle was referenced in palette and patterns. Lattice-like work on knits, broderie anglaise, aforementioned crochet, fabric hand dyes, and more added to the complexity of the collection. Volume appeared in the form of pajama-like oversized shirts and pants looks and poof bubble-short gowns made from a utilitarian trench coat material.

“Taking something traditionally humble and weird and using it in that way was exciting for us,” she said of the bubble-shaped dresses. Accessories added drama and pragmatism in sturdy city sandals.

While overall, the effect of the clothes in the grand marble-floor space, the live melodic sound of singer Indigo Sparke, sculptor Emily Thompson’s floral design, and the rich, layered, textured creations that were viewed by Katie Holmes in the front row proved too much at one point. To achieve that calm runway Zen, a tighter edit of some repetitive ideas would have made a more succinct and targeted message.

"Sep 12, 2022","International Talent Support 2022 was an exciting competition. This year the fashion competition, which was able to be held in person in Trieste (north-east Italy), after two years of being held digitally due to the pandemic, highlighted technique, the research of materials and manual mastery in particular, as evidenced by the victory of British designer, Charlie Constantinou, who was awarded the ITS Academy Award.He will receive 15,000 euros, as well as a six-month mentorship, promoted by the trade show organizer Pitti Immagine. The Cypriot-born designer, who also won the second prize in the ITS Sportswear Award powered by Lotto Sport alongside Hin Fung Jesse Lee (1st) and Edward Mendoza (3rd), seduced the jury with an intelligent and generous collection with great work within materials, through the creation of a stretchy quilted nylon, adaptable to all morphologies and climates.

Inspired by the clothes made by the Inuit from their own resources to protect themselves from extreme climates, the designer created basic knitwear outfits (knitwear, gloves, tights) and inserted stretchy parts around the elbows and lower abdomen, to be worn with puffy vests for a warrior-like look, and flared pants, ribbed with laces or zips, designed to shrink the garment to the body.A graduate of London's Central Saint Martins, Constantinou, age 24, also impressed with his palette of deep greens, mauves and blues, shades he creates himself, and tie-dye effects.

""Color and textiles are my passion, but my favorite part is when it comes to making the collection with all the elements,"" said the designer, who already displays a certain confidence behind his apparent nonchalance. After some time at Edward Crutchley, one of the new names on the London scene, the winner of this 20th edition of the ITS competition refined his training with Savile Row tailor Clothsurgeon, and has just started to retail a small selection of pieces via Ssense and H Lorenzo.

Another passionate textile researcher and knitwear enthusiast is Martina Durikovic, age 27, from Bratislava, Slovakia. Durkovic won the €8,000 ITS Media Award with a flashy and extravagant collection for galactic princesses, made entirely from a gelatin-like material that is totally biodegradable. Remembering that her grandmother used to water plants with potato starch water, which formed a gelatinous substance, the creative thought of transforming it by cooking, drying and crystallizing it into a kind of bioplastic, which she cut into threads so she could knit them.""It's biodegradable, resistant and 75% waterproof. It can be treated with wax to make it totally waterproof, and by adding flavors, like strawberry, lemon or mint, you can even eat it,"" she explained with a big smile. Durikovic also graduated from Central Saint Martins, and since 2019 has relocated to Paris to work at Chanel, in textile research and development.

Brussels-based Lili Schreiber, age 26, won the OTB Prize, one of the most coveted awards, with a prize of 10,000 euros. Trained at La Cambre and also having relocated to Paris, she was recruited in 2021 by the house of Lemaire as assistant designer for women, after an internship at Kenzo.

Under a seemingly more classic appearance, the wardrobe she created revealed her ability to play on several fronts with great consistency and a beautiful mastery of cuts and finishes. It was an elegant and graphic collection brilliantly mixing colors and geometric patterns in multifunctional clothes.

The ITS special mention prize promoted by Vogue Italia was awarded to Eva Heugenhauser, age 25, who stood out with her innovative textile research by creating water-soluble clothes from a kind of latex obtained after countless tests in her kitchen. The Austrian designer, born in Sankt Johann in the Tyrol region, moved to New York to study at the Parsons School of Design. She currently works for Thom Browne, having took men's suits as a starting point, working on the notions of value and duration, as well as on the concept of disappearance of clothing.

Finally, with his object-bags of great plastic beauty without necessarily being functional, French creator Victor Salinier, age 26, won the ITS Responsible Creativity Award promoted by the Camera della Moda (CNMI).

"Sep 12, 2022","One of New York’s hottest fashion brands today is Khaite, and one could fully comprehend why after attending its powerful, punchy and precisely Southwestern collection staged in Meatpacking District on a wet Sunday.Khaite apparently stands for both designer Cate Holstein’s nickname and the Greek term meaning long flowing hair, and the hair certainly flowed in this show, from bedroom curls to bedraggled femme fatale spirals.

Holstein’s jump off point was Wild at Heart and Lost Highway, David Lynch’s uber darkly surrealist road movies. “I feel like everyone is constantly talking about are we ever going to get past the point of starting over? You rarely get that in life, the last time was probably after WW2,” explained the founder and designer, who speaks in an almost machine gun like stream of consciousness.

Hence, she showed lots of Nicholas Cage worthy python skin, made into crisp rocker jackets or elongated blazers in embossed calfskin, printed on washed cupro, and even seen on jacquard-stitched viscose knitwear. Cage even crooned on the late 80s soundtrack.

Holstein can cut like a great tailor - with sharp shoulders and grand lapels - or drape with gusto, dressing her cast in oversized double breasted satin jackets or tough chic leather bombers paired with brilliant slung leather sarong skirts.

Multiple fringes and crystal finishes suggested a Las Vegas show gal travelling with confidence, and an intense air of seduction. “There’s a heavy sinister influence that I like, but for us it’s always going to be about dressing a woman and not making a collection. We don’t really make collections. This is a continuation of our woman. Who will always be the New York woman, a strong, sharp independent figure always on a journey, always trying to find themselves,” she added.

The Lynchian reference apparent in the leather looks delineated by large format  zippers, often functional and others integrated as surreal stripes. All recalling Patricia Arquette at her steamiest.

Plus, Holstein showed a clever take, Khaite’s Olivia bag presented as a clutch, in a strong silhouette and made in vinyl, crystal and patent leather. 

There is nothing terribly revolutionary about Khaite, but the whole collection just seems very, very now. Edgy luxury that the models clearly loved wearing, as will Khaite's customers. Staged inside a gallery on Little West 12th Street in the Meatpacking district, the space was crammed with buyers. All of them were smiling at the finale - their eyes bright at the thought of the sell-through.

Cate Holstein does not plan to tweak this collection, which all goes straight into retail. She doesn’t have to because it’s all extremely wearable, aided by being cut with just enough volume. 

In a word, Khaite's is the most cleverly focused collection in America today.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 12, 2022","Following the death of the Queen last week, the British Fashion Council has recommended that London Fashion Week shows due to take place on the day of her funeral should be rescheduled and that means changes for Christopher Kane and Roksanda, among others.The state funeral has been confirmed for next Monday (September 19), which will also be a public holiday. This means that while it’s not obligatory for businesses to close, most shops are likely to be closed, as well as shows being moved.

As far as LFW is concerned, aside from Roksanda and Christopher Kane, other shows and presentations due to to take place on Monday included Eftychia, Chopova Lowena, Ancuta Sarca, Edeline Lee, Pronounce, Sinead O’Dwyer, Roberta Einer, Dilara Findikoglu, Chet Lo, Emilia Wickstead, Paul & Joe, Di Petsa, and Helen Anthony.There were evening shows and events on the schedule too and the BFC has also recommended that events like parties and other celebrations across the whole of the fashion week should be cancelled.

Queen Elizabeth had a close relationship with London fashion week having even attended the event back in 2018 when she presented Richard Quinn with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design.

Prior to being sat front row at his AW18 show, she toured the Designer Showrooms event to view the collections and met some of the creatives behind the labels.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

All of the winning looks, including the runway collection from the finale, are available in the e-tail giant’s Making The Cut store online.

Every product in the assortment “is meant to celebrate individuality and self-expression, which are principals of the brand. rare/self is not defined by gender or size and forgoes traditional sizing, making it accessible to all Amazon customers”.This co-brand also has third-party sustainability certifications featured in Amazon’s Climate Pledge Friendly programme.

It’s an interesting launch given that the designer isn’t known for ‘everyday’ looks. But Amazon Fashion said the collection “brings their avant-garde fashion perspective to an assortment of wardrobe essentials that can be worn every day, anywhere and by anybody”.

Instead of traditional sizing, rare/self features an “all gender size curve, with sizes ranging from 1-8. Customers can refer to the  size charts, located conveniently on rare/self’s detail pages, to find their perfect fit”. 

The clothing is made with cotton, certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the backpack is made from recycled cotton, certified by the Global Recycled Standard (GRS).

"Sep 12, 2022","The weather gods were cruel to Tommy Hilfiger on Sunday, but the muses sang succinctly at his rain-drenched show on the shores of New York’s East River. 

A show that climaxed with the latest smart Hilfiger partnership, this time with UK print maniac Richard Quinn. Paired with a signature collection that featured a brand new Tommy Hilfiger logo courtesy of artist Fergus Purcell.“I collected big, oversized Tommy Hilfiger tartan shirts, in my school days. I had quite a lot of them. It was a nice little link,” revealed Quinn in a pre-show preview with Hilfiger in the American designer’s Madison Avenue headquarters.

Going on to incorporate Johnny Rotten-worthy tartan into this homage, as Quinn worked closely with the Hilfiger creative team. “I love the mix of punk influence, the varsity, the jock and the cheerleaders,” laughed Hilfiger, many of whose looks incorporated Purcell’s new graphic.

Quinn has a small but busy team of five in London which creates its own prints in-house, and even supplies other brands. Based on their own drawings which are then digitalised and printed on their two-meter wide, tactile printers.

“I’ve always loved color and print, and the idea of making a proper textile, like a jacquard. Or taking a generic fabric and turning it into something really, really luxury,” explained the burly and bearded Quinn.The son of two Irish immigrants, Quinn garnered global attention four years ago after winning the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II fashion prize, presented by the late Queen in London.

Asked about his plans for next weekend’s London Fashion Week, Quinn revealed that his Sunday evening show would be pushed back until after the royal funeral, scheduled for Monday, September 19.

With Tommy’s mainline, it was all about playing with the logo and twisting classic elements from the archive. The silhouette was voluminous, from the variety jackets and the great, bold logo-mania parkas in sustainable faux-down jackets or oversized chinos.

“We wanted a big wide open set to build a big set, and there are not that many in Manhattan. Plus, we have great view of the city from this drive-in,” explained Tommy.Hilfiger first got the idea of linking with Quinn, after seeing Kylie Minogue wore the designer at the British Fashion Awards. “And I thought this stuff is just incredible. Now, in his collection with Hilfiger, I see lots of hints of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood circa 1967!” insisted Tommy.

For his main collection, Tommy went back to his archive in the 90s and upgraded the silhouette for today. All based on Andy Warhol's legendary 'Factory' of creative talents based in New York's Union Square. 

“We haven’t been oversized in a really long time, but our proportions have changed. Very high waisted and wide-legged and very big,” explained Tommy, who showed massive rugby shirts; dark green plaid mohair sweaters; mini-skirts shown with giant pirate boots; green and black McArthur tartan cardigans and WW great coats.A new monogram is a fresh identity for moving forward, as Hilfiger has in the virtual world, with a linkup with video game specialist Roblox. A new game was launched as the show kicked off, allowing Hilfiger to offer fans physical clothes, NFTs and 'see now, buy now' clothes all together.

“Young people want instant gratification,” underlined Hilfiger, who pointed to likely best sellers. As examples, he held up a logo cricket sweater once made for Michael Jackson back in 1983, which now comes renamed with the new logo. Or a varsity jacket emblazoned with cloth poppies and sunflowers 

Quinn’s collab’ also featured 100% reversible down jackets, various versions of which were worn by a giant community of rappers at this show. Though the coolest idea was the graphic Tommy Quinn logo seen in a cool dude cowboy jeans and jacket.

Keeping the youth quake going, the cast included Dylan McDean, the 16-year-old son of famed British stylist Tabitha Simmons.

The linkup - which will retail in major Hilfiger stores - started selling immediately as the show happened. Even as the heavens opened on the entire audience. Yet the show was so livewire not a soul sought shelter.

"Sep 12, 2022","Taku Yhim of Parsons School has won the 2022 Supima Design Competition Prize, leading a joint show of eight young talents inside Spring Studios in Tribeca, New York.

Taku Yhim nabbed first prize - and a $10,000 award - thanks to a highly impressive deconstructed series of looks made of Supima, the cashmere of cotton.An alumni of Parson School in New York, Yhim was one of eight finalists, representing leading design and fashion colleges in the United States. The other seven finalists were Candice Tianyu, Academy of Arts University; Chan Kyoo Hwang, Drexel University; Fabian Renteria, Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising; Bryan Barrientos, Fashion Institute of Technology; Antonia Bruno, Kent State University; Hu Jun Yi, Rhode Island School of Design; and Michelle Sumin Suh, School of Art Institute of Chicago. 

“Thank you. This feels so great to win this award and to have participated in this unique process,” smiled Yhim.Finalists are required to prepare five looks based on different versions of Supima cotton - denim, jersey, velveteen, shirting and twill.  Supima, short for Superior Pima, is sustainably grown and only in the West and the Southwest U.S. 

The 16-member jury views the looks and look book video the day before without knowing the names of the designers and then votes. This year the jury was composed of included Ann Caruso, Avril Graham, Cipriana Quann, Claire Thomson–Jonville, Edward Barsamian, Fern Mallis, Freya Drohan, Godfrey Deeny, Jeffrey Taylor (2016 SDC winner), Jerome Lamaar, Kelly Augustine, Lisa Lockwood, Luke Meagher, Mickey Boardman, Shibon Kennedy, and Tyler McCall.

CFDA Award-winning evening wear designer, Bibhu Mohapatra, again acted as mentor to the finalists, while Christian Siriano returned as host and judge, jointly MCing with Coco Rocha, in a final staged inside Spring Studios in Tribeca.

In an exhilarating performance Yhim riffed on Samurai warriors showing blends of multi-padded or quilted armour; yarn and wool embroidery; and frayed laser cut suiting in hues of ocean and peacock black. If they had turned up in a Comme des Garçons show, they would have looked at home; suggesting Yhim has the design chops for a great future career.

Others to impress were Bryan Barrientos of FIT whose fine flute-shape velveteen dress and sculpted violet denim chess piece gown showed real bravura.

While Michelle Sumin Suh scored with some rather divine layered looks, notably a splash pattern cocktail that really wowed.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 9, 2022","The new New York City mayor recognized the importance of the fashion industry at the start of NYFW in an inaugural speech at Gracie Mansion on Thursday night.
 
""New York is as cool as can be right now in Gracie Mansion with these wonderful folks with swagger,"" said Mayor Adams in the city's official mayoral home.Indeed there was plenty of swagger as the NYFW kick-off event hosted by Anna Wintour and the CFDA drew in New York's most influential designers, personalities, retailers, CEOs, and members of the press who make up the American fashion industry.
 
""You are signatures of who we are as a city, and I cannot thank you enough; you grace Gracie Mansion with your presence,"" Hizzoner continued with the accolades. ""You see your business as just fashion. I see something else. I see that wedding dress you designed as that person starts her life. I see that tie that someone wears that you designed so correctly they were able to nail the interview because they felt good about themselves; I see it when we go out to see women who are victims of domestic violence to make sure they have clothing to get dressed in. Or when we go to a homeless shelter, we have people who do not have clothing to make it from day to day and are embarrassed to go to school because they don't have a change of clothes. Some of you donate and dedicate clothes for them,"" he offered by commending the audience.The Mayor has already earned himself a reputation as a sharp dresser who loves fashion (he attended the Michael Kors show in February) and shared a story of helping a young man buy some extra ties. He understands the importance of feeling good by looking good.
 
He also understands the importance of messaging via clothing and how designers' creativity aids this. ""When I want to place emphasis on ending gun violence, a designer comes to me to design my tuxedo with ""End Gun Violence"" on the back of it drawn over the entire subway system to show we must be safe in our city,"" he emphasized. 
Next, he thanked Anna Wintour for her tireless championing of New York fashion and the city itself. ""No person personifies the spirit and energy more than Anna, the Angel that Wears Prada,"" he gushed, adding, ""Her love for this city is remarkable. Her dedication, commitment, and how she talks about what this city will become.""
 
Mayor Adams is also keenly aware that fashion is a serious business. ""This week, we will move about and know you are a 600-million-dollar juggernaut just in this week alone. That is twice the amount we make than if we had the Superbowl here. You bring the economy to the city with 100,000 employees, 100 million dollars' tax revenue; you bring the character, the posture, and the stance of this city; you are the exclamation point of NY,"" he concluded, adding, ""New York is back! We are live; we will bring the artistic energy and the diversity we are known for. We will make this a signature event every year that I am Mayor,"" he said to a roaring round of applause.
 
Anna Wintour's dedication was evident as the British Dame proudly wore her medal bestowed by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Even the death of the beloved monarch of 70 years could not keep Ms. Wintour from her duties as American fashion's head cheerleader.

A recent cause to make the industry more equitable and diverse was evident in the room. The Condé Nast artistic director and global editorial director of Vogue noted, ""there's always more to do, but if you look around the room tonight, I think it's clear New York has a very diverse fashion community.""
 
Steven Kolb, CFDA CEO, was also quite pleased with the new administration's handling of the fashion industry. ""I love that he opened Gracie Mansion. Mayor Di Blasio did this eight years ago, but this is different. He supported manufacturing initiatives and economic development; he saw it and elevated and collaborated on it. Mayor Adams sees that too, but he also sees the creativity. He understands the seriousness of fashion but also the magic of it,"" he said as guests continued to mingle through various rooms or take in the fresh September air on the veranda. 
Designer Wes Gordon had kicked off the Mayor's speech with a New York dream angle. He recounted how he dreamt of New York as a child growing up in Atlanta, sketching dresses on his math homework and standing there introducing the Mayor of New York as ""surreal.""
 
""Being a fashion designer was a dream career and New York a dream home.
It's a magical place. To me, it meant 7th Ave., Barney's, Vogue, Saks, Bryant Park, Bergdorf Goodman; it was a cinematic version of fashion outsider dreams,"" he said.
 
He told of his humble beginnings, having borrowed money to start a business and deflating an air mattress just to have space to design a collection in a small live-work space where he rode the subway between lower Manhattan and the Garment District in search of fabric, trim and sample makers. He was armed with a dream to become the next ""Ralph, Tom, or Calvin.""
 
After pulling together a fashion week presentation on a shoestring during a snowstorm where his catering cost more than anything in the production, Gordon had one of those ""magical fashion moments.""
 
""It was a success, and the impossible happened; it was an NYC fashion miracle. The Bergdorf team came, Kirna Zabete came, Harrods came. I had enough orders to do a second season,"" he recalled, adding, ""A few seasons later, I was in the Vogue Fashion Fund, and it was incredible. It made me soul-search as a designer and pushed me to answer questions about my work that I otherwise never would have done.""
 
An earlier surreal moment was when Anna Wintour and then CFDA president Diane Von Furstenberg visited his tiny live-work apartment. ""The other residents of the live/work building probably haven't recovered from seeing those two icons in the elevator,"" he said.
 
The appointment to succeed Carolina Herrera, the queen of elegance according to Gordon (and many more), was ""a dream come true of a dream so big I didn't dare to dream it,"" he concluded, expressing humility and gratitude to be among such a talented pool of fashion professionals.
 
The audience of those swagger-filled professionals in the room included Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, Thom Browne, Tory Burch, Vera Wang, Stan Herman, Andrew Bolton, Victor Glemaud, Karlie Kloss, Aurora James, Emily Ratajkowski, Cynthia Rowley, Rebecca Minkoff, Stacy Bendet, Lauren Santo Domingo, Derek Blasberg, Willy Chavarria, Dee Ocleppo, Bach Mai and Carly Cushnie among others.
 
In his signature grey shorts suit, Thom Browne stressed the importance of an event like this.

""I think it's important to see the continued support as a part of the economy and the city's culture for people outside of fashion to see what we are doing. And recognize it like the rest of the cities around the globe.""
 
Tommy Hilfiger, making fashion a family affair with wife Dee Ocleppo and daughter Elizabeth Hilfiger, who designs Foo and Foo, said it was great to get the recognition from the Mayors of New York, noting though it wasn't usually an invitation to Gracie Mansion. He was excited for the upcoming week. ""It's very vibrant and full of energy, and it's international. It's not like old times; it's changing and evolving, but for us, it's great coming home,"" he said. The last runway show took place pre-Covid in London.
 
Victor Glemaud also had high hopes for the week. ""We are open and back. It's going to be a full, robust, fun fashion week which hasn't been since the pandemic."" He also expressed the continued support of designers of colors on all levels; retail, wholesale, finance, and marketing continued support. ""It can't just be a seasonal thing.""

"Sep 9, 2022","The CFDA is set to celebrate its 60th anniversary with a curated retrospective of American fashion in the metaverse, as well as commemorative NFTs.The metaverse exhibition, dubbed 'Fashioning the Shades of American Design', will highlight 60 looks from the CFDA’s six decades, from designers such as Ralph Lauren, Patrick Kelly, Donna Karan, Naeem Khan, Tracy Reese, Oscar de la Renta, Anna Sui, Stephen Burrows, Thom Browne, and Tory Burch.

The exhibition was curated by fashion historian and assistant curator of fashion of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Darnell-Jamal Lisby with the aim to educate, entertain, and foster community worldwide.In particular, the exhibition, set to open in December 2022 in The Sandbox, will be organized by five themes: Illuminating Fantasy, Illuminating Romance, Illuminating the Avant-Garde, Illuminating Understanding, and Illuminating the Soul.

Likewise, the CFDA has asked select designers to create eight exclusive 60th anniversary creative designs and experiences to be minted into NFTs. Each NFT comes with unique utility perks that will allow unprecedented access and will be available for auction to benefit the CFDA Foundation Inc.

“In celebrating 60 years since Eleanor Lambert founded the CFDA, we not only commemorate some of our biggest moments, but also want to use this milestone as an opportunity to look to the future,” said CFDA CEO Steven Kolb.

"Sep 8, 2022","For decades Paris, New York, Milan, and London have reigned as the four fashion capitals whose influence radiates to the four corners of the globe. A quartet that could be joined by cities in northern Europe and the United States, which are gradually making a global style statement and impacting creative processes in the fashion sphere. Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Detroit are among the new title contenders.The world will soon have the chance to discover the spring-summer 2023 collections of renowned fashion houses in New York, London, Milan and Paris. Fashion week season is always an intense period for labels, a dense schedule of events, exhibitions, presentations, and parties, as well as appointments with crowds of buyers and media from all over the world. While it may seem that these four fashion capitals retain the upper hand on fashion domination for the moment, other cities are making their mark on the scene and beginning to establish their reputations in a sector once believed to be impossible to penetrate.

Copenhagen, capital of sustainable fashionMost brands and designers, regardless of their country of origin, have been taking into account the environmental challenges facing fashion for a few years. But some cities, including Copenhagen, are definitely ahead of the curve. Something that now means its fashion week is considered the greenest in the world and enables participating labels a spotlight on the international scene. Ganni, as well as Saks Pott, Cecilie Bahnsen, and Rotate Birger Christensen, are among the brands whose reputation has spread far beyond the borders of Denmark, as has the bold elegance that characterizes the fashion of the Danish capital.

It is indeed Copenhagen Fashion Week's commitment to sustainable development that has boosted its profile on the fashion scene. While the influence of London and New York seems to have been declining for several years, Copenhagen has gained more authority since it began its environmental transition. Since the beginning of 2020, there has been talk of an action plan for sustainable development, inviting brands to respect several requirements including the non-destruction of unsold goods, the use of sustainable packaging, and a large share of certified, organic or recycled textiles. Ambitious objectives that have drawn attention to the Danish capital, whose collections are now closely followed.

Stockholm, capital of cool and street style

Stockholm's influence on fashion is not new, but it has been growing over the years, and has really taken off with the industry's need to reinvent itself in order to reduce its impact on the planet. Like its Nordic neighbor Copenhagen, Sweden's capital city is constantly working to improve environmental responsibility and is a model of sustainability. After revolutionizing the world of design several decades ago, Sweden is now tackling fashion. The Nordic style, which just a few years ago was still lacking mass acceptance, now responds to what people around the world are looking for.

Functional, streamlined and even minimalist, with some very eccentric touches here and there, Stockholm style mixes an elegance that is sometimes pushed to the extreme and a casual approach, Stockholm street styles are regularly gushed over in fashion magazines around the world. Something that contributes to the international reputation of many Swedish brands, from HOPE to Acne Studios to Tiger of Sweden.

Detroit, a hotbed of creativity

While several places in the United States, including Los Angeles and Brooklyn, can clearly claim to be the country's new fashion capitals, for very different reasons, Detroit can boast of being home to talent that has made -= or will soon make -- a name for itself on the world stage. Considered the automotive capital of the world just a few years ago, the city that was nicknamed ""Motor City"" is no stranger to the fashion sphere. The success of the Carhartt brand, founded in the late 1800s in Detroit, is a testament to its workwear, which is making a strong comeback under the impetus of the influential Generation Z.

But of course that's not all. For several years now, labels originating or based in Detroit like Deviate and Hope for Flowers have been emerging, as if to better highlight the creative force of this working-class city. And one thing is sure, things are on the move for Michigan's biggest city. Proof is the arrival of many luxury brands, including Gucci, which has just opened a boutique on Library Street. The Italian house also collaborated last year with the label Detroit vs. Everybody, founded by Tommey Walker Jr.

"Sep 8, 2022","Gent London is bringing a blend of sustainable fashion and contemporary and street art to London Fashion Week this month. It’s reworking fashion pieces to “create wearable works of art” and is collaborating with artists including Sophie Tea, Rich Simmons and Emma Gibbons, among others.

Launched during lockdown in 2021, the brand aims to “breathe new life into vintage fashion classics by turning them into vibrant and collectable artworks”. It said it does this via “striking and playful” collabs that also “respect the clothing brand”.“Working closely with its international artists, [it] takes luxury vintage clothing and upcycles each piece to make it truly unique”, the company explained.

It added that it “ethically sources grade A vintage classics and works with its artists to ensure only sustainable materials are used for the collaborative project. A percentage of each sale is also donated to environmental charities”.

Its latest initiative sees Sophie Tea (“who has challenged the traditional art world by selling solely on Instagram”) updating a vintage Burberry trench coat with her signature ‘compliment hearts’. 

Meanwhile Rich Simmons “has also been inspired by the iconic British brand with his pop art-inspired ‘Blow My Mind’ design, featuring his distinctive ‘Skullerflies’."" 

LA-based and globally renowned artist Punkmetender has three pieces within his collection showcasing his colourful designs. 

Other artists with ongoing collaborations include TikTok sensation Onnika Caldeira (aka Girl Scout Shoes) who recently launched a luxury handbag collection influenced by the New Romantics of 40+ years ago.

And the label has also announced a new collaboration with the actor, screenwriter and artist Tom Moutchi. He’ll “bring his ‘prophetic drawing’ style” to his collaboration.

"Sep 8, 2022","The house of Karl Lagerfeld has unveiled its latest creative collaboration, a link-up with British model and actress Cara Delevingne. 
Entitled Cara Loves Karl, it is billed as a “perfect for back-to-school” collab capsule, which will debut on September 8 in Karl Lagerfeld stores, on Karl.com and via select wholesale partners worldwide.
 
Cara is “a character. She’s the Charlie Chaplin of the fashion world. She’s kind of a genius, like a character out of a silent movie,” Karl is quoted as saying in a release, which features  images of the collection.Designed in sustainable fabrics for all genders with signature “transformable pieces that offer a diverse range of styling options in just one garment,” the Paris-based house stressed in a release.
 
Aesthetically, the clothes blend Karl’s signature black and white German expressionism with Delevingne’s quirky sense of humor. So, Lagerfeld’s classic crisp white cotton shirt is reborn as a two-tone vertically divided white and pale blue shirt, and then dissected with buttons above the tummy. Other mannish versions come with the buttons along the spine. While unisex gent’s suits are cut with deep-gorge jackets with cross straps, worn over Peaky Blinders-worthy wide pants. 
Add in faux-fur biker jackets; unisex denim pants; voluminous hoodies and transformable bombers and it’s a neat blend of posh industrial style and European tailoring. While accessories include beanies, totes, bovver boots and fanny packs.
 
“(Karl) believed in me when so many others didn’t, including myself. He is a visionary, a genius but more than that a dear friend,” comments Delevingne, whose 31 acting credits include Suicide Squad, Anna Karenina and music videos for the likes of Chanel, Dior and Jimmy Choo.

"Sep 6, 2022","The CFDA, which celebrates its 60th anniversary, opens New York Fashion Week on Thursday evening with mega labels, global brands, rising stars and Gracie Mansion 
New York Fashion Week, which currently boasts a total of 141 live shows, spread over eight days, seems to be rebounding quicker than many rivals, in a season featuring events by over a dozen star European houses,  local global brands and a diverse new cast of rising stars.
 
The officially opening cocktail in Gracie Mansion is not the first time that the grand colonial building on the East River has hosted fashion: Mayors Bill de Blasio, Michael Bloomberg, Rudy Giuliani and even Abe Beame, back in 1977, all hosted events there. But since his election in January Mayor Adams has become happily known as a fervid fashion fan, having enjoyed runway shows by Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren, and attended a Met Gala. Adams showed up in a graffiti-flavored frock by Brooklyn designer Laolu Senbanjo of Nigeria, which read dramatically “End Gun Violence.”Moreover, Adams has been vocal in his support for the fashion industry and its twice-yearly season, which was estimated to have attracted 150,000 visitors and generated some $600 million per season prior to the pandemic.
 
“City Hall has always been a friend to fashion. But to have a major who really appreciates fashion’s role in job creation and in the overall economy is really great. We could not be happier that Major Adams and  Anna Wintour are kicking off the new season at Gracie Mansion,” explained Steven Kolb, CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the official organizer of the New York season, who will cohost the event. 
Hizzoner’s reception also underlines a new dynamism in New York Fashion Week, led by a drive to create far more inclusive seasons, backed up by a policy of unearthing a new generation of talent.
 
“I am really proud of the fact that this season over 20% of the brands are led by designers of color. There have long been questions about lack of diversity in our industry. But it’s a global issue. It’s a very important conversation we have been having in the States. And to see the lineup for the coming season reflecting greater diversity, well -- I’m very excited about that,” said Kolb.
 
One important driver has been the CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund, many of whose finalists will be showing in NYFW. Among that list, Kolb raved about several. Notably Sukeina, by Omar Salam, a Parsons School of Design graduate who did stints at Sonia Rykiel and Christian Lacroix before forming his own label – named after his late mother, and standing for light.
 
Also earning his imprimatur: “a really cool knit brand” named Judy Turner; and a spruce new label using explosive prints named Fe Noel, by Grenadian-born Felisha Noe. Another to watch is the beautifully named Harwell Godfrey, a jeweler who skillfully blends ethnic, ancient and posh bohemian. 
Plus, Puppets and Puppets, an art-driven project by mixed media artist Carly Mark. “That will be an awesome show!” insists Kolb in a Zoom to his home in Pennsylvania.
 
Though the heart of the matter in New York will be powerhouse billion-dollar-plus brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, Coach and Tom Ford, who is billed as rounding off the season with an evening show on Wednesday, September 14. Proenza Schouler opens the official catwalk action mid-afternoon on Friday, September 9.  Though, that morning also begins a New York Men’s Day, featuring menswear brands like Nobis, Terry Singh, Amirok, Atelier Cillian, TEDDY VONRANSON, Todd Patrick, Fried Rice, Hola Market and Nicholas Raefski; along with two genderless labels SO.TY  and A.POTTS.
 
Though perhaps the biggest surprise is the arrival of a quartet of thriving European houses to stage runway shows. Ranging from Fendi, the Roman-born star brand of luxury conglomerate of LVMH, which will stage a 25th anniversary event for its Baguette bag, to Bottega Veneta of rival Kering, and Marni, the darling of the art house avant-garde fashion cognoscenti. Even including active sport giant Puma and Swedish architectural style label Cos.
 
“Marni and Fendi are conversations we have been having with those brands for quite some time. I see their arrival as a reaffirmation of the power of the US market. We are big country where a lot of people shop. And the best reach way to reach American consumers, and to build a brand and business in USA is to come to New York. So, we really welcome them. It’s all part of a growing recognition of New York city as a platform for global brands. And I am not trying to be so nationalistic. I feel same way for Thom Browne or Altuzarra when they show in Paris and raise our American flag,” enthused Kolb.
 
Elsewhere, a slew of European labels are also getting in on the action – with parties by Isabel Marant, Givenchy and a skyscraper penthouse bash to fete the new Cara Loves Karl, a linkup with Cara Delevingne and Karl Lagerfeld. US Vogue has a 130th anniversary on Monday and there’s Harper’s Bazaar Icons event – it’s first since the pandemic struck - done with Bloomingdales, to add an extra  level of enthusiasm. 
While other labels sure to attract intense demand for invitations are Altuzarra, Brandon Maxwell, Carolina Herrera, Gabriela Hearst, Jason Wu, KHAITE, LaQuan Smith, Prabal Gurung, Sergio Hudson and Victor Glemaud. Plus, first-time additions to the schedule’s in-person activations include AnOnlyChild, ASHLYN, Heron Preston, Foo and Foo, Midnight Studios, ONE/OF by Patricia Voto and Tia Adeola.
 
That said several notable marques like Marc Jacobs, Monse or Pyer Moss are not on the official schedule. Monse will show off-calendar on Thursday with American Express, part of a consumer activation with internet card holders. Jacobs hasn't shown on calendar in quite some time, and Pyer Moss’s last event was a couture show by designer Kerby Jean-Raymond off calendar in July of 2021.
 
“Lots of people prefer a personal strategy, which is fine. And one reason why when Tom Ford was CFDA chairman we also created an overaching umbrella – American Collections Calendar. So, wherever an American showed, even in Europe, we captured that,” noted Kolb. 
However, the biggest missing name of all is Ralph Lauren, America’s single most famous brand, who after staging a one-off show inside the Museum of Modern Art in New York, will now decamp – for at least one season – to LA for an October 13 show.
 
“I’m not at all surprised by Ralph’s decision.  Ralph Lauren is theeee ambassador of American fashion and him going to Los Angeles is a great consumer angle, a tremendous idea. And I would not be surprised if he went to Paris one day. He has the global infrastructure,” said the CFDA CEO.

The CFDA has also teamed up with Polygon Studios and The Sandbox, to provide professional development programs to explain opportunities within the metaverse to designers and fashion professionals.
 
“I totally believe in creating NFTs. Even if after being immersed in the metaverse it is still like speaking in a foreign language! And who knows where it will be in three months or a year? Brands are very interested but also confused. But we’ve had huge demand for these programs!” underlined Kolb.
 
All shows and presentations will be presented via Runway360, CFDA’s centralized digital hub and business tool to support American fashion brands’ collection releases year-round.
 
“Last season I said the theme was resilience and optimism. This season it is about power and action. Of course, the pandemic meant a gradual return, but this is finally a full-on fashion week,” Kolb concluded.

"Sep 6, 2022","Weinsanto is expanding his brand universe by launching his first NFT wearables for K-pop group Lightsum. Former dancer Victor Weinsanto, known for his queer, fun and exuberant style, is working on a virtual project for his brand that will be presented during Paris Fashion Week at 35-37 rue des Francs-Bourgeois, Dover Street Market's cultural space on September 26, on the same day and location as his show. The NFTs will then be launched in October on the bnv.me website.The digital fashion experience entitled 'M3TALove' will be promoted by the virtual fashion platform, bnv.me, launched in 2021 by Hong Kong-based start up Brand New Vision (BNV). Together with BNV's team, the French designer created eight exclusive looks as NFTs for the eight Lightsum members: Sangah, Chowon, Nayoung, Hina, Juhyeon, Yujeong, Huiyeon and Jian.

The designer interacted with each of the girls from his Paris studio, sharing music videos and sketches via Zoom meetings over the summer, before meeting them in person in Los Angeles at the K-Con festival held in August.""My plan was to connect with the spirit of Lightsum. Each girl has such a strong personality, and that really inspired me,"" said Weinsanto in a statement.

""This opportunity to work in the metaverse gave me extra motivation and impetus. It allowed me to reinterpret and accentuate my own cabaret-inspired designs, to play with virtual fabric effects, volumes and colors. (...) Web3 and innovative technologies offer a new horizon, both in terms of creativity and in addressing environmental concerns through new supply chain and production possibilities. I love the fact that Weinsanto can now be both virtual and physical,"" he continued.

The Alsatian designer studied ballet in Stuttgart and received his fashion training at Atelier Chardon Savard. He went on to work for Y/Project, Jean Paul Gaultier, Lecourt Mansion, Maxime Simoëns and Chloé before going solo in 2020, presenting his first ready-to-wear collection at Paris Fashion Week. Adrian Joffe, of Dover Street Market, has been supporting the commercial development of the young Parisian brand, which is distributed at H Lorenzo in Los Angeles, Maria Luisa in Doha, Penelope in Brescia (Italy) and Selfridges in London, among other retailers.

"Sep 4, 2022","Vancouver, Canada-based global lifestyle brand Herschel Supply has opened a new space to support emerging creative entrepreneurs with advice and resources to help launch their careers.Dubbed the 'Bank of Creativity', the space is located in the former Brooklyn Bank in Brooklyn, New York and recently opened their doors to 18 up-and-coming creators with the aim of help them elevate their creative careers.

Historically, private financial institutions have never favored artists and creators. Herschel Supply Bank of Creativity was established by asking the question: 'what would banking look like if it were designed for and by creatives?'Each creator was carefully partnered with one of the three advisors based on their areas of interest and expertise including established creatives Olivia Rose, an interdisciplinary artist and landscape architect, and founder of Original Rose; Danny Cole, an interdisciplinary artist and director of Creature World; and Sophia Wilson, a photographer and visual artist. 

Unlike traditional banks, the mentorship advice was personally tailored to each individual, their unique backgrounds and their craft. In addition to the mentorship, Herschel provided resources and supplies that are critical to their career growth.

“It was important for us to demonstrate our support in a way that would be impactful to creatives,” said Lyndon Cormack, co-founder and managing director of Herschel Supply Co. 

“Who better to provide those breaks than artists who’ve experienced the tension between creativity and commerce first-hand, and who’ve come out on the other side?”

Herschel has a long history of projects geared towards uplifting and empowering creatives and their communities. Most recently, in May, they launched the Nova Art Project, a series of bi-annual partnerships with female artists.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 2, 2022","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) has announced Black Boy Knits as the 2022 DHL Logistics in Fashion Award winner.

"Sep 1, 2022","The streets of Copenhagen exude fashion. The city's inhabitants are renowned for their unique style, a far cry from the usual conventions of their European neighbors. They parade around on bicycles wearing meticulously careless looks, bright color combinations, voluptuous bucolic dresses or technical and environmentally friendly fabrics. The idealized picture of minimalist Danes with a ""hygge"" ethos is more than just a stereotype; it has become the unwritten rule in a capital city plagued by functional Rains raincoats and Ganni logos. Between August 10 and 12, the capital hosted its most important fashion events simultaneously: the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair (CIFF) and the Copenhagen Fashion Week shows. Let’s take a closer look at a capital city that sets itself apart with its drive for innovation and sustainability.More than 700 international brands gathered at the 59th edition of CIFF, an event held in the middle of August a few weeks ahead of the traditional ""rentrée"" of trade fairs and fashion weeks in September. Held in its usual location, the luminous Bella Center on the outskirts of the capital, the event celebrated its particular return to normality under the slogan ‘Together Again’.

Although CIFF only cancelled one of its fairs due to Covid-19, in February last year, its last edition was the first one organized without the restrictions of the pandemic, resulting in widespread enthusiasm in its corridors, as attendance of firms, buyers and foreign press exceeded last year's figures, when the event attracted 198,000 visitors and 500 participating brands. Among the international buyers, the UK was particularly well represented by Browns, Harrods, Selfridges and Fenwick.Christina Neustrup, director of CIFF during the last two years affected by the health crisis, stepped down from the position during the last edition of the fair, which she described as a ""cooperative movement"". She handed over the baton to former L'Oréal executive Sofie Dolva and became CEO of the jewelry firm Kinraden. 

“It has been a tough period, but we have focused on developing CIFF as a global platform with fixed objectives linked to our community. We are convinced that we do things better together. I am happy to see the return of American, Asian and European visitors. Momentum is back,"" said Neustrup, summing up the state of the event upon her departure. The first edition led by Dolva, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the event, will take place from February 1 to 3.The halls of the show were marked by innovation and sustainability, the two core values of CIFF Sustain, a space set up three seasons ago and dedicated to leading brands in the field, such as German labels Oftt and Black Velvet Circus, Hungarian brand Manuela Collage Arts or Ukrainian brand TG Botanical. Founded during the pandemic by Tatyana Chumak, TG Botanical employs 25 women and is committed to local production, experimental dyeing techniques and fabric production technologies from nettles, flax or hemp. After the Russian invasion, the brand is struggling to relocate its business.

TG Botanical was not the only Ukrainian firm in search of international contacts to ensure its survival after the war. The artisanal tailoring brand Litkovska (formerly known as Litkovskaya) presented garments made from surplus fabrics. It shared the spotlight at the entrance to the main hall with the impressive installations of local label Han Kjobenhavn, New York-based brand Quod and Labrum London, whose African-influenced British tailoring has already paraded at London Fashion Week. Present at CIFF since 2017, Labrum noted that ""before the pandemic, the fair was huge and it was easy to get lost in,"" adding that ""now it's smaller, but the space is very well curated.""

“Attendees come looking for Scandinavian inspiration, but it is important to offer a comprehensive universe as an overview of the industry capable of surprising"", said Neustrup. In fact, the new Vintage area (the only area dedicated to the BtoC of the entire fair), complemented the Danish designs with brands from London and Los Angeles; and the men's space presented a good handful of Japanese and British collections, such as those of Aton or Kaptain Sunshine. However, several international buyers consulted described the range offered in the menswear area as ""limited"".The future of Danish events: sustainability and innovationLikewise, the more commercially oriented Scandinavian and international womenswear had two large dedicated spaces and an area devoted to circular economy, with more than 40 Danish brands promoted by the Lifestyle & Design Cluster. The spaces served as a dissemination area in which sustainability was addressed from the circular design approach by brands such as Andersen-Andersen or KnowledgeCotton Apparel; the sourcing of respectful and innovative materials by Copenhagen Cartel or Design Agger; responsible production and distribution by the BrandTag tool or the packaging company Re-Zip; the extension of the life cycle of garments by Ganni’s rental service or Aiyu’s repair service and recycling done by companies such as Green Cotton Group or Haack Recycling.“We cannot forget that trade shows are a business, but at the same time we are obliged to use our voice to steer things in the right direction. It is imperative that the fashion industry addresses the climate crisis. One of my main goals has been to turn a platform into a sustainability and circularity educational and training tool, as well as to push technologies to be more sustainable,"" said Neustrup, admitting that ""although it is a very specific field, it is where we can make a difference"". 

Together with Copenhagen Fashion Week, CIFF has set sustainability and transparency targets for 2023 that will place minimal demands and accountability on participating brands. ""Sustainability should not become a competition but a shared goal. In our industry there are networking groups, where firms can share knowledge and ideas on sustainability. As most brands face difficulties when confronted with the same challenging issues, it is important to support each other,"" said Cecilie Thorsmark, CEO of Fashion Week, on the importance of building synergies in this area. 

In order to have a physical presence in addition to its biannual celebration, CIFF has 20,000 square meters spread over 2 floors dedicated to showrooms of brands throughout the year. When asked about the future of fairs and their format, Neustrup stated that ""they should be places where innovations are built together, functioning as spaces where conversation and inspiration take place, not necessarily for traditional business trade.”In her opinion, digitalization will be ""the most disruptive element in the industry"". ""I am confident that at future trade fairs there will be no need to produce swatch books; instead, we will use avatars on the stands to modify sizes and colors. Collections will be presented using NFT and 3D technology that will recreate the motion of the garments,"" she added. Fashion week takes over the city“In Scandinavian creative practice there is honesty, purpose, and authenticity. The way our designers have translated this has had a very positive effect on a large scale, as these values are aspirational and it is possible to identify with them,"" enthused Thorsmark, commenting on the appeal of Copenhagen Fashion Week and the international exposure of Scandinavian brands.

Building identifying narratives seems to be one of the secrets of Danish success. Easily wearable garments, relatively accessible brands with values shared with their clientele and shows free of grandiosity and with a democratic style, with diverse and inclusive model castings and events often open to the public, are examples of the strategy behind the specific and relaxed nature of Copenhagen Fashion Week. 

While the well established brands Iso.Poetism by Tobias Birk Nielsen and Rotate opted to hold their shows at CIFF's very own venue, the Bella Center industrial space, others such as Ganni, Saks Potts and Wood Wood preferred to take over different open spaces in the capital. The former, founded by Ditte & Nicolaj Reffstrup in 2000 and now a mainstream phenomenon outside the Danish borders, organized a massive fashion show on Ophelia Plads. With the local sunbathers seen on the docks serving as a backdrop, pastel decor, diving ramps and social media star Emma Chamberlain in attendance, who also starred in the campaign of the brand’s latest collaboration with Levi's, Ganni brought life to the city by displaying cheerful looks in bright colors, models riding bicycles and two collaborations dedicated to ""upcycling"" with Barbour and 66'North.A strong love for Copenhagen was also felt in the central Kongens Nytrov square under the attentive gaze of tourists and passers-by, at the show of the brand founded by designer duo Barbara Potts and Cathrine Saks, Saks Potts. Inspired by Princess Mary of Denmark, the collection featured long leather coats, fuchsia sequined dresses and skirts, golden garments and fringed details. Some exceptional guests like local influencer Pernille Teisbaek or designer Аna Kraš were among the models that walked down the runway.

Stine Goya, another of the most internationally known names that showed at the fashion week, unveiled Tap1, an industrial space on the outskirts of the city that the brand decorated with columns of sand that gradually collapsed. The collection presented fluid garments in fluorescent tones, oversized silhouettes and watercolor prints and geometric patterns that stayed true to the signature style of the brand launched in 2006 by its eponymous designer. The brand is set to open a store in London this September. 

Wood Wood, founded in Nørrebro in 2002 and boasting stores in Berlin and London, decided to take its collection to the Lille Langebro bridge, usually crossed by cyclists and pedestrians who, on this occasion, watched the show from opposite sides of the river. The show was a tribute to the brand's ties with the city held in the form of a sunset rave, with avant-garde garments featuring denim overlays, camouflage prints, sporty silhouettes and splashes of orange and neon green.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

The monogram, which was created from an interlocking T and H, was introduced as a “new mark of distinction” for the brand. “Since 1985, the ‘TH’ monogram has stood for authentic prep style, playfully reinvented for all,” Hilfiger said in a release. “Fergus Purcell has been a truly inspiring collaborator.

"Aug 9, 2022","Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, whose global career spanned more than half a century, has died aged 84 of cancer, it emerged on August 9.He died on August 5 and his funeral has already taken place, with ""only relatives participating"" in line with his wishes.

Miyake was part of a wave of young Japanese designers who made their mark in Paris from the mid-1970s. He pioneered high-tech, comfortable clothing, side-stepping the grandiosity of haute couture in favour of what he called simply ""making things”.He established the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo in 1970, and soon afterwards opened his first Paris boutique. The fashion innovator said he was driven to create clothes that ""bring beauty and joy"" after witnessing the horrors of Hiroshima.

Alongside Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, Miyake was part of a wave of young Japanese designers who made their mark in the French capital from the mid-1970s, following the lead of fashion greats Kenzo Takada and Hanae Mori.

Among his innovations was the Pleats Please line of permanently pleated items that don’t crease. The futuristic triangles of Miyake's geometric Bao Bao bag were much-copied and he made more than 100 black turtlenecks for his friend, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Miyake also impressed runway audiences with his A-POC (A Piece Of Cloth) concept, using computer programming to cut whole garments with no seams.

""When I grow weary with where I'm going, or when I stumble, I'll return to the theme of 'A Piece of Cloth',"" Miyake said in 2006 after winning the prestigious Kyoto Prize.

""From ancient times, in Greece or Africa, every culture has started (making clothes) from a single piece of cloth, or skin,"" he explained.

HIROSHIMA SURVIVOR

Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945. He survived the blast, which led to the end of World War II after the bombing of Nagasaki three days later.

Although the bombing left him with a lifelong limp, he rarely spoke of his trauma, once breaking his silence in a 2009 New York Times article calling for nuclear disarmament.

""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience: a bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape,"" he wrote. ""I remember it all. Within three years, my mother died from radiation exposure.”

Having graduated from Tama Art University in Tokyo, Miyake moved to Paris in 1965, where he studied at the elite Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne.

As a young designer he worked under Guy Laroche and Givenchy, but his outlook was also influenced by the huge student-led uprising of May 1968.

Seeing protests engulf the French capital made him realise ""the world was moving beyond the needs of haute couture for the few and towards simple more universal elements such as jeans and T-shirts,"" Miyake told CNN in 2016.

After establishing the Miyake Design Studio and opening his first Paris boutique, he continued to innovate and by the 1980s, he was experimenting with materials from plastic to metal wire and even artisanal Japanese paper.

Teamwork was essential to Miyake, who preferred the anonymity of his research and development lab full of textile scientists and engineers to the bright lights of the catwalk.

""You always see things in a different way when you allow others to become part of a creative process,"" he told the New York Times.

He pulled back from designing his Paris collections at the turn of the century and has since given a series of talented young designers their big break.

But he continued to oversee the brand, and his obsession with technology endured -- with everything from fabrics to stitching explained in minute detail in the notes of every catwalk show.

Miyake is especially revered in France, whose former culture minister Jack Lang came to Tokyo in 2016 to award him the Legion of Honour at a major retrospective.

Lang, who still wears Miyake pieces he bought many years ago, described the designer in October 2021 as a ""man of a deep humanity, open to everything”.

""Issey Miyake is a researcher, a discoverer, a real inventor who conceived of and used new materials and textures the world had never seen,"" he told AFP.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Jul 27, 2022","New York's women's fashion week is looking increasingly attractive with the addition of another prestigious name to its program. Following in the footsteps of other fashion labels, Marni, owned by Renzo Rosso's Italian fashion group OTB, has decided to present its Spring/Summer 2023 collection in the Big Apple on the evening of September 10, as revealed to the press by the brand's artistic director Francesco Risso.""This fashion show is part of a new strategy initiated after the 2020 lockdowns with the desire to explore new territories,"" explained the fashion house, confirming the announcement made by Risso to Vogue Business, without, however, revealing the location of the show.

The show will be accompanied by events in the brand's three New York stores and will again be organized in collaboration with Iranian-born American artist and creative director Babak Radboy and British-American musician Dev Hynes.In September 2020, Marni launched its video project ""Manifesto,"" which saw its summer 2021 designs worn by all different types of people in different international metropolises, from Dakar to Tokyo. The project was filmed and subsequently broadcast digitally. Seeking to get ever closer to its community, the house orchestrated a memorable show in Milan a year later, involving everyone in the show, from its staff to the audience.

The New York event should allow the brand ""to reconnect with its audience,"" as Risso explained, revealing his plans to ""go on tour"" thereafter. New York should therefore be the first stop of a world tour that will take Marni away from the Milanese catwalks to parade its collections all over the world. After the United States, the label will head to Asia in February.

Marni is the latest brand to announce its move to New York in September. Fendi will also be present with a special show to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its Baguette bag. Tommy Hilfiger will return to the city after three years, as will Italian brand Chiara Boni, which after the pandemic chose to show last January in Florence. Puma is also returning to the Big Apple after a five-year absence with a ""phygital"" show that will combine both sportswear and ready-to-wear.

“In 1997 designers received a call from the Ukrainian Fashion Week to unite in the industry, and today UFW is developing in key areas – sustainability, digitalization, inclusion and diversity. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, all of us are living in a state of incredible stress and survival that everyone feels in every corner of our country. However, Ukrainian designers found the strength during the war to create new collections to tell the whole world about Ukrainian resilience and courage, as well as to show Ukrainian national identity through clothing”.“As we continue to focus on the responsibility of our movement to incubate and strengthen the future of vegan fashion, we are incredibly humbled and proud to welcome Ukrainian Fashion Week as this year’s guest and take the opportunity to introduce their exceptional vision to our international audience”, said  Emmanuelle Rienda, founder of Vegan Fashion Week.

“I look forward to activating our partnership and parallel dedication to celebrating creativity in meaningful design."" This unique fashion collaboration will introduce the best of Ukrainian fashion through a collective runway, a designer showroom and authentic conversations surrounding ethics and sustainability in fashion hosted by the newly renovated California Market Center in downtown Los Angeles.

The show will feature more than a dozen Ukrainian brands and designers, including the eco-responsible label Chereshnivska founded by Irina Kokhana, the hemp textile and ready-to-wear brand Devohome and its designer Oksana Devoe, and the avant-garde brand DZHUS founded by Irina Dzhus. Other accessory brands will also be present, such as Ochis, a brand of glasses made from coffee beans by Maksym Havrylenko. Rienda plans to cultivate the global fashion scene with exciting collaborations and activations, such as the exclusivity for the launch of a capsule collection by Nous Étudions (LVMH Prize 2020 Shortlist Designer) in collaboration with Desserto cactus-based biomaterials. And, continue to establish Vegan World, the only professional trade show focused on vegan fashion, beauty and lifestyle brands.
 
Ticket purchases and additional donations will benefit the VFW Mentorship Fund, which provides continued support for emerging sustainable fashion designers to increase their exposure and business opportunities in the U.S. market. This season’s benefits will support Ukrainian fashion designers.

"Jul 27, 2022","Sustainable fiber and technology solutions firm the Lycra Company, announced on Tuesday a partnership with Browzwear, the industry's leading 3D software for apparel design and development. The partnership will provide designers using VStitcher and Lotta, the pioneering platforms for 3D fashion design, the ability to develop products incorporating fabrics containing Lycra and other sustainable fibers.

In particular, designers can digitally create activewear, denim, swimwear, ready-to-wear, and intimate apparel fashions using fabrics showcased in the Lycra Brand Materials Library. All the materials with digital versions in the Lycra Brand Materials Library can be sourced directly from one of 15 global mills initially featured on Browzwear. These materials have all been tested and certified by The Lycra Company, ensuring they contain the company’s authentic fibers. “At The Lycra Company, innovation is in our DNA, and we constantly look at new ways to create value for our mill customers, brands, and retail partners,"" said Julien Born, CEO of The Lycra Company. 

""Digital transformation and sustainability offer opportunities, but also stretch our approach to innovation as fast and meaningful advances in those areas cannot be achieved alone. By teaming up with Browzwear, we are taking an important step in that direction, with the goal of ultimately changing the way the apparel industry will engage and interact digitally to optimize the sourcing of high-quality fabrics that extend garment wear life and reduce the need for samples.”

The Lycra Company has been pioneering a multifaceted digital transformation since last year when it launched the Lycra One customer portal, an online marketplace connecting brands, retailers, and garment makers to a global network of partner mills in a virtual capacity. 

This partnership also advances the Lycra Company’s sustainability commitment, as creating digital garments via Browzwear streamlines the production process and reduces the need to manufacture samples, thus reducing waste. 

""We are thrilled to collaborate with The Lycra Company and enable our users to leverage its well-known performance fibers to better incorporate them into designs, faster, easier, and more sustainably. Our Fabric Analyzer ensures the 3D versions of fabrics made with fibers from the Lycra Brand Materials Library result in true-to-life simulations of the garments, with physics and movement that reflect the durability and unique functionality of these fibers,” said Avihay Feld, Browzwear co-founder and CEO. 

“We believe this partnership will drive positive impact throughout the industry by helping brands and retailers to operate a more sustainable, efficient development process.”

Looking ahead, the Lycra Company said it will continue to work with Browzwear to add new resources to the materials library as they become available.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 26, 2022","""Jors,"" or jean shorts, are a top trend of the summer that's all the rage on social networks. And women are the latest adopters of this long and wide style of denim shorts, inspired by menswear looks.Women are increasingly drawing fashion inspiration from men's wardrobes, it seems. After the suit and tie, ""jorts"" are now riding high in the womenswear department this summer -- although not everyone will be pleased to hear it! This fashion item, which already appeared in men's wardrobes last year, has even been adopted by the Hadid sisters and certain luxury brands.

While women are no strangers to wearing denim shorts in summer, it is a version cut a little longer, and especially quite wide, that's making an appearance this year. On TikTok, the #jorts hashtag already counts more than seven million views. It includes videos of women and men who explain how to cut off old jeans to the right length to get the on-trend look, or offer tips on styling outfits with their ""jorts.""Continuing the trend for all things ugly?

But this fashion item is not a hit with everyone, whether among men or women. These denim shorts are not necessarily flattering for all body types, and some people balk at the outfits suggested by influencers. Under one video with 25,000 likes, posted by the TikToker jenisshit, comments such as ""I wouldn't be seen dead wearing this outfit,"" stand in stark contrast to those from fans of the trend.

""Jorts"" are often matched with tank tops, loose tops and visible socks, sometimes even with the famous Birkenstock sandals that are still proving popular. It's a masculine/feminine mash-up of a look that's very trendy right now. This look is also reminiscent of the ""weird girl"" aesthetic that has been another recent craze.

""Jorts"" seem to fall in line with the broader trend for ugly clothes returning to fashion. So, are you ready to cut off your old jeans or to let yourself be tempted by a pair of these long-cut denim shorts?

"Jul 26, 2022","Made from recycled military truck or aircraft tyres, Vietnam's handmade rubber sandals, the famously rugged footwear of the Viet Cong, have travelled vast distances over the decades.In the bustling capital Hanoi, all kinds of shoes are on sale: from $1,000 Gucci heels to $2 plastic slippers.

But for those seeking a nod to yesteryear, the hard-soled rubber sandals -- evocative of the communist state's resourcefulness under fire -- are available at markets and small stores alike.- Uncle Ho's sandals -

Dao Van Quang paid $8 for a standard pair at a shop outside a Hanoi museum devoted to the country's revolutionary leader -- and dedicated rubber sandal wearer -- Ho Chi Minh.

""I wore rubber sandals when I was at school, in the 1980s,"" the 47-year-old from central Quang Nam province told AFP.

""They are of historical value, easy to wear and look nice.""

At the museum, the well-worn pair belonging to the former North Vietnam president known affectionately as ""Uncle Ho"" are displayed in a glass box with his Chinese-style uniform.

Ho's sandals have even been lauded in national songs praising his simple lifestyle.

""These sandals helped Uncle travel a long way, and with them, he overcame difficulties to build the country,"" the lyrics of one song say.

The Vietnamese first began making rubber sandals in the late 1940s, during the First Indochina War against the French, using tyres from an ambushed army truck.

They found the sandals were cheap to make and survived well in wet, muddy and hilly conditions, as soldiers marched through thick jungle.

Later, during the Vietnam War, the simple but sturdy footwear became a symbol of the communist Viet Cong forces' ingenuity in their fight against the United States' military might.

Even in peacetime, the design remains popular for sustainability reasons, said Nguyen Duc Truong, who has spent his life crafting the shoes.

""I think there is still much potential for rubber sandals,"" the 58-year-old said.

- Rising popularity -

Vietnam is one of the world's top four countries for shoe manufacturing and its factories produce pairs for major brands such as Nike and Adidas.

The footwear export industry generated nearly $12 billion in the first half of this year, according to government figures.

While the humble rubber sandal does not quite generate the same revenue, it is high on heritage value and its popularity as a casual shoe is rising.

Vua Dep Lop, which started as a small business and became Vietnam's rubber sandal leader, sells the footwear for around $10 a pair.

At its workshop in Hanoi, shoemakers use sharp knives and chisels to craft the sandals from huge tyres that are almost the same height as the workers.

While the traditional black models are bestsellers, a colourful modern twist is helping the sandal appeal to a younger demographic.

Nguyen Tien Cuong took over the business from his father-in-law in 2011, and has sold more than half a million pairs of rubber sandals since then.

""We tried to make them softer and more fashionable. After changing the style and format, we started having more customers,"" he said.

"Jul 22, 2022","Sofia Sanchez de Betak is kinda the It-Gal of the It-Gals in Paris.
 
Mum, graphic artist, influencer, entrepreneur and fashion designer, Sanchez de Betak debuts her latest collab for her brand Chufy this weekend in Spain. 
Her latest gal-pal linkup: with iconic actress Rossy de Palma, Pedro Almodóvar’s fetish thespian and offbeat fashion plate. Their launch location: La Residencia, part of the LVMH-owned Belmond chain, located in Deià, the beautiful and artistically inhabited seaside valley on the west coast of Mallorca. 
 
Deià is where the brilliant novelist Robert Graves penned his greatest works; Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote some of his Broadway musicals; The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and David Bowie hung out and where Kate Moss, Nicolas Ghesquière and Harry Styles vacation. It’s also where Sofia and her hubby, power producer Alexandre de Betak – the guy behind the stellar Dior shows – have a rather swish house.“It’s a nice honor and a neat thrill to work with Sofia. And she’s going to throw me a greatttt party!” chuckled Rossy when we caught up with her at Olivier Rousteing’s collection for Jean Paul Gaultier, a designer for whom she has modelled.
 
Besides being a lady of great taste, Sofia is also a smart designer who manages to combine dashing cosmopolitan chic with looking great just off a late-night plane panache. Her custom-designed prints in blotchy subtracts, funky folkloric or jumbled-up florals have real élan. 
Born in Buenos Aires, matured in Manhattan, resident in Paris, the big-eyed Sofia has led a gilded life, yet there is nothing self-indulgent about Sofia and her brand Chufy, culled from her childhood nickname. Chufy now retails in over 100 doors. Last year it created a hit Mango x Chufy collection.
 
She has even written a coffee table book published by Assouline, exalting her haute luxurious bohemian travels and myriad inspirations.  It would be easy to be envious of la Sofia, but hang it all -- her clothes are feminine, flirty, fashionable and fun. So there.
 
So, we caught up with the willowy mid-thirties mum in her Seine-side Paris home for a pow-wow on Chufy, running a business from Buenos Aires and collaborating with Rossy.
 
FashionNetwork.com: Tell us about your background?
Sofia Sanchez de Betak: Well, I first moved to New York, 12 or 15 years ago. I don’t even know how, but I started doing art direction. I got a job with Doug Lloyd for some years and then I worked for Raul Martinez and then with Alex in New York and at other agencies doing art direction for fashion. I came to Paris and saw Alex and couldn’t keep my full-time job. So, I started freelancing and then eventually I got brands asking me to do capsules for them and collaborations. 
 
FNW: Is that how you became an influencer?
SSDB: If you want to call it that, but I don’t really talk to the camera. I don’t really interact that much.
 
FNW: So, you don’t consider yourself as an influencer ?
SSDB: Exactly, I’m not. I have a really hard time telling people what to choose. I just live my life. I share a little bit of a very narrow part of it, and I work a lot. I don’t think I share much of my work online. So now I don’t consider myself of an influencer.FNW: What were the first things you did with Chufy?
SSDB: Back in 2017, Bergdorf and Colette kinda’ at the same time, asked me to do something for them. So, I did kinda’ like did a capsule for them both.
 
FNW: Did you target an age group?
SSDB: No, I just got inspired by Argentina.
 
FNW: Is Chufy targeted at young women?
SSDB: Not really. There was some, like, more timeless pieces for all sorts of ages. In fact, our pricing was always a bit above young. I would say I’m over 35 years old at least.
 
FNW: So, you began by selling in Bergdorf?
SSDB: It was on the designer floor. And they gave us a window in Colette and things went really well. They kind of sold out. So, I did another little capsule, and it sold out.  All sudden I had a brand. In the middle of this a kind of partner showed up, who knew about the business and how to manage all the production side and all that. So, we partnered, and it’s been going pretty seriously since then. I mean, during the pandemic, I thought, ‘guys we need to close it! It’s never gonna’ work!’ But we have our team in Argentina which makes for pretty healthy fixed costs for the company. So, during the pandemic, we were healthy, as we didn’t have a crazy rental in New York.
 
FNW: So, your team is based in Buenos Aires?
SSDB: Yes, I have 14 people there, including doing the website. 
FNW: So, you have a proper business?
SSDB: Yes, we have like 100 retailers. No accessories but contemporary dresses. Mostly printed. All travel inspired by different destinations. It keeps you on the holiday mode when you’re in the city, but still dressed for light meetings in everyday life or also to wear on a trip. It’s easy to pack, easy to wear and fresh.
 
FNW: What fabrics?
SSDB: From organic cotton to packable and mostly sustainable fabrics.
 
FNW: How much you invest?
SSDB: A few million. I mean without investment. With my partner, we grow the company with its own income. We began taking dividends from last year. It’s healthy and somehow, I mean with the Argentinian setup it makes it cost efficient. We are now doing this collaboration with Rossy De Palma, whom I think is incredible. We try to do an artist collaboration each year.  Just for me to work with her it’s amazing. It’s fun for the team and it allows me to have a contact with my culture and my language. 
 
FNW: Tell us about the Rossy de Palma project?
SSDB: Well, we debuted on July 8. And we will do a big Belmont Hotel launch party in Mallorca on July 23rd because Rossy is from Palma de Mallorca. Alex and I have a house there, so I’m kind of living there.

"Jul 22, 2022","Adidas Originals has linked with Craig Green to unveil the CG Squash Polta AKH, a new style that’s “a tribute to Adidas design heritage”. It launches on 27 July.The shoe is a recreation of the 1988 Squash, a performance style “built for swift and nimble movement”, but now “reconsidered for the 21st century using a transparent mesh upper, exposing and celebrating the shoe’s integral layers”.

It’s an interesting design with the internal construction revealed both with that transparent upper and a cutaway outsole to show the foam midsole, “revealing the industrial colours that are usually left hidden, through exposing them and keeping them in their raw form”.The company said it’s “a fresh take on the ghost layers that are a signature of Green’s work with Adidas Originals”.

The transparent upper is printed with the Adidas 3-Stripes, “creating different transparencies where it crosses with the internal construction”. 

And the inner canvas is also on show and is printed with the 1988 serial number of the original shoe design, F.6314b Squash. 

The company has retained a suede trim around the outer sole and a perforated tongue to “maintain a design dialogue with the original shoe”.

The style also has new laces, combining three fine laces that are joined together at the tip, “evoking the spirit of the 3-Stripes”. There’s also Craig Green and Adidas branding on the shoe.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 22, 2022","In the most traditional of Italian ways—over great food—the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), led by chairman Carlo Capasa, welcomed the New York press to a sumptuous lunch feast Wednesday to promote the upcoming fifth annual Sustainable Fashion Awards in Milan.

The event returns live on September 25 after a physical hiatus during the pandemic in 2020. The Italian fashion organization took the opportunity to announce the nominees of the Bicester award, the ceremony's celebrity host, and restate its mission of establishing a concrete set of guidelines for the fashion community across the globe to adhere to.Held at Casa Cipriani on South Street in lower Manhattan, the lunch was made possible in collaboration with the Ethical Fashion Initiative (EFI) of the United Nations, a program of the International Trade Center, and with the support of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Italian Trade Agency, and the Milan City Council.

Desiree Bollier, chair and chief merchant of Value Retail Management and creator and operator of The Bicester Collection, a luxury multi-discipline shopping destination, joined Capasa for the event. The retail group partners with the CNMI and sponsors the Bicester Collection Award for Emerging Designers, one of the twelve awards to be given. ""Part of our DNA and raison d'etre is to support talent – fashion, art, and music at large. We are committed to this, and one of our values is innovation,"" Bollier said before announcing this year's finalists: Torlowei, Nkwo Onwuka, and Themoiré (the former are both Nigerian brands and the latter Italian).

Bollier explained the winner would display and sell their collection at the eleven Bicester Collection Villages across Europe and China. Additionally, they will have the opportunity to design an exclusive range of products to be sold at the group's U.S. affiliate properties, The Ozone boutique in San Diego, and the Isles Lab concept store at the UBS Arena.

Winners also receive a year of mentorship to guide them through the business aspects of helming a collection.

""When the 2008 financial crisis hit, we realized young designers would not survive if we didn't step in and support them. So, we established the Creative Spot pop-up for designers to display and sell their collections. Over time we added a mentorship program to help designers with practical matters such as contracts, leases, and other non-creative decisions,"" continued Bollier. Previous designers to benefit from the program include Richard Quinn, Tiziano Guardini, Mary Katrantzou, Christopher Kane, and Erdem Moralioglu.Also in attendance was Riccardo Vannetti, who serves as CNMI's strategic projects director. He announced the evening's host, Rossy de Palma, as a multi-hyphenate in cinema, fashion, music, modeling, and performing arts with a personal commitment and passion for philanthropy in sustainability, human rights, and environmental justice. Vannetti also confirmed the location as Milan's Teatro alla Scala and other details for the approximately twelve awards to be given out. Winners are selected based on their commitment to sustainability in its highest meaning pertaining to vision, innovation, commitment to craftsmanship, recognition of differences, circular economy, human rights, and environmental justice.

Besides Capasa, the panel of twelve judges includes Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder and chair of trustees, Ellen MacArthur Foundation; Simone Cipriani, head and founder of the Ethical Fashion Initiative at the International Trade Centre, chairperson of the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion; Federica Marchionni, CEO, Global Fashion Agenda and Kerry Kennedy, President Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.

The New York lunch was the last stop on a global tour promoting the awards that included meeting with The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode in Paris; the German press in Munich; and the British Fashion Council in London. The aim was not only to spotlight and familiarize foreign press with the event, which took place live in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and then digitally in 2020, but also to reiterate the need for a cohesive approach to all pillars of sustainability as outlined by CNMI. These include design, raw material choices and their processing methods, distribution, marketing and sales practices, management systems, contribution to the national economic system, business ethics, transparency, and education.

In his welcome speech, Capasa talked about CNMI's early days of getting Italian powerhouse brands such as Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Prada, Valentino, Versace, Bottega Veneta, Fendi, Moncler, and more, on board with sustainability goals.

""Italy produces 70 percent of the world's luxury goods, so we have a huge responsibility, giving us the right to help establish guidelines. It's the second largest business sector in Italy, valued at 100 billion euros in wholesale sales yearly, which is 250 billion euros on the market,"" he explained while also making light of his country's current political woes.

Alluding to the belief that cooperation isn't the Italians' strong suit, he said initially; the brands were wary of sharing their practices with one another.

""Once they started to get to know each other and discuss sustainability, they realized you must all do it together, or it doesn't exist. The whole chain must be sustainable with the whole community working together. Now they share new innovations they discover. There is new cooperation that was not in fashion before,"" he continued, pointing out the shared production and distribution chain.

The CNMI worked with the United Nations Ethical Fashion Initiative and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation to give a framework of rules and guidelines. From this, the ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) due diligence table was created by EFI in collaboration with the CNMI.

""Now we have over 92 percent of the Italian supply chain using the chemical guidelines; that's 67,000 production and 60,000 distribution businesses using it.

""We must share the rules; it has to be part of the whole system, not just by brand or country. Let's cooperate on these practices and set up a system that works for all.

She will present her new luxury collection during the spring 2023 women's ready-to-wear shows, which run between September 26 and October 4.Paris Fashion Week has poached a number of British talents recently, including up-and-coming men's designer Craig Green, who returned to the catwalk in June, also for the first time since the pandemic.

Beckham last held a live show for her luxury brand in London in February 2020, then put on online shows in September 2020 and February 2021.

She was notably absent from London Fashion Week in February, having previously stated that high costs were making it difficult to stage live shows.

"Jul 20, 2022","Last week, the Tom of Finland license unveiled its new collaboration with JW Anderson, the third of its kind. Over the last 10 years, more than 30 brands, from Comme des Garçons to Diesel, Sweden's CDLP or the French Carne Bollente have been associated with the homoerotic imagery created by Finnish artist Touko Valio Laaksonen in the late 1950s. A work that is now distributed in many countries and emblematic of gay and queer culture forever thanks to the Tom of Finland license, owned by the Tom of Finland Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles and dedicated to preserving the work of the artist, the erotic arts in general, and to offering a cultural program and hosting artists in residence. A look back at the phenomenon with Joakim Andreasson, who has been director of the Tom of Finland license since 2014.FashionNetwork.com: What messages and values does the work of Tom of Finland represent today?
 
Joakim Andreasson: In the most universal terms, Tom’s body of work represents tolerance, acceptance, pride, joy and freedom. His imagery has become symbolic of the advancement of gay rights and sexual freedom. FNW: The capsule collections signed with fashion brands and houses brought Tom of Finland’s imagery to the streets. Who started to buy these pieces ?
 
JA: The distribution of Tom of Finland designs has evolved in tandem with human rights and increased visibility of the LGBTQ community around the world. Over the past near ten years, we have worked hard to embed Tom of Finland’s role in popular culture through commercial partnerships across categories, including fashion, the adult sector, spirits, home textiles and lifestyle merchandise. Most of our collaborations have been released in Europe and North America, but we are also doing projects in Asia, including a ready-to-wear collection with the Thai brand Leisure Projects which will be released on the 22nd of July with a special pop-up at Central Original in Bangkok. The online store, CULTUREEDIT / Tom of Finland Store, established in 2017 with a storefront in Hollywood, has been instrumental in making our collaborations available to a worldwide audience and generate interest from partners to collaborate.
 
FNW: Tom of Finland brought gay arts into fashion. Does this mean that the subject of sex is more uninhibited today? That it is easier to talk about it, to the point of displaying it?
 
JA: I think there are multiple levels of sexual expression in fashion – be it through shape and form, attitude and personality or references and imagery. Tom’s work influenced countless iconic fashion designers including Jean-Paul Gaultier, Helmut Lang and Tom Ford to name a few. It's only as of late however that the fashion world has embraced and featured actual Tom of Finland imagery on garments through our official partnerships. It required a few brave fashion voices, including our ongoing relationship with Jonathan Anderson (JW Anderson) and past collaborations with Nicola Formichetti (Nicopanda), Hubert Pierre Pouches (Rufskin), Andreas Palm and Christian Larson (CDLP) and Max Schiller (Eytys), to break the mold. The acceptance of the display of erotic art on garments is certainly relative to where you live and to how progressive and an area is. Regardless, I think there will still be limits that are not necessarily contingent on the ability to express, but rather contingent on people’s comfort with “wearing sex”. An example would be the new Tom of Finland x JW Anderson tank top, which features phallic imagery. The beauty of such garments however is that they inspire people to tap into a part of themselves that they otherwise would not through fashion.FNW: Recently Diesel and Happy Hour Skateboards have signed collaborations with you. How do you explain the enthusiasm of “mainstream” brands for the work of Tom of Finland?
 
JA: Even within more mainstream brands, it takes brave voices to challenge the status quo and incorporate art that challenges that norm. For Diesel, it was their creative director Glenn Martens who spearheaded the partnership, and for Happy Hour Skateboards it was Jarkko Propudas, an openly gay Finnish skateboarder. I think the enthusiasm is multi-faceted, and beyond the appreciation of Tom’s art and its message, my experience with more mainstream brands is that they choose to work with us to align themselves with the LGBTQ community with a stronger stance – daring to not only have the conversation about love and human rights, but also sex and desire.
 
FNW : With what direction and philosophy are you directing the Tom of Finland license?
 
JA: I always try to maintain a mix of high-end and more accessible products, be it a cock ring, a hand-knotted rug or fine fragrance. Together they create a tension that evokes the unexpected. Contrary to other artist estates, we can communicate Tom of Finland’s work on multiple levels, including matters of human rights, fashion, art and sex. In Finland, we have realized projects that are communicated more broadly as Tom is considered a national treasure. That said, I mainly credit the continuous lifecycle of our licensing projects to our collaborative nature and openness to exploring ways of interpreting and working with Tom’s body of work. It is very important that each project has creative integrity and channels not only Tom, but also the voice of the brand we work with.
 
FNW: How do you choose your collaborations today? 
 
JA: It is a very organic process and dialogue – especially for more creative partnerships in fashion, where it is much more important to be aligned in terms of vision and execution. Some take years to come into fruition, and others a week, so with that said, there is no strategy. Partnerships happen when the gay fashion stars are aligned. Many partnerships are based on my personal relationships and dynamics I established in the near 20 years of working with Mr. Helmut Lang and via brands we carry at CULTUREEDIT / Tom of Finland Store. Collaborating with designers we also sell allows for a more honest conversation that is based on an established relationship that goes beyond the capsule at hand – leading to a more authentic outcome that could only have been achieved with time and regular engagement.FNW: JW Anderson has just released his third capsule collection with Tom of Finland. What does this collaboration mean to you? 
 
JA: Jonathan Anderson's methodology in incorporating Tom’s work into the world of JW Anderson is different from others in the sense that he only features works that he acquires for his personal art collection. Collecting art is immensely personal, so this equation in determining imagery becomes much more intimate. And sheds further insight into Jonathan’s appreciation for Tom’s work.
 
FNW: Has fashion's new spotlight on Tom of Finland's work sparked any negative reactions from anti-gay organizations or similar?
 
JA: Not from organizations or media per se, but if you look at social media comments at times, we are very well aware that there is still a long way to go and that outside of what appears as a queer bubble, there is an immense amount of work to do.
 
FNW: Finally, Tom of Finland, is it a message of freedom?
 
JA: Yes, absolutely. And what is more freeing than uninhibited sex?FNW: What are the next developments for the Tom of Finland license?
 
JA: We are continuing to develop new partnerships, most notably in Finland in anticipation of an upcoming exhibition there. In fashion we will next see our collection with Honey Fucking Dijon hit stores this fall. In general, I am an advocate of ongoing relationships rather than funneling Tom’s work through a never-ending list of brands, so I look forward to continuing and furthering those we have in place and look forward to exploring what other facets of Tom’ work they want to encapsulate. But there will for sure be surprises along the way! And if anyone in the skincare world reads this – call me!

"Jul 14, 2022","PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger label is returning to New York Fashion Week in September for the first time in three years, with an “experiential” runway event built around its latest see-now-buy-now collection for Fall 2022.The company said it will also be “immersing audiences physically and digitally into a refreshed brand world”.

The show happens at 7pm on 11 September and it said “the interactive experience draws inspiration from New York’s one-of-a-kind creative scene: an epicenter of people and subcultures, a collision of lo-fi and hi-tech, and a fusion of style and creativity”.The event will “connect people through spontaneous moments of creativity at an IRL showcase set at the Skyline Drive-In in Brooklyn and in a parallel metaverse activation”.

Tommy Hilfiger, whose eponymous brand was originally founded in New York, said: “My heart immediately went to New York’s iconic creative culture when I thought about where to launch our return to fashion week. This is where fashion, art, music and entertainment was all coming together when I first started out in the industry. And today, it is still this approach that inspires me to engage with the cutting-edge communities building new creative experiences. 

“This season is all about the collision of my favorite archival inspirations with new live event concepts and virtual worlds. It’s the perfect expression of what we stand for as we pay homage to our roots with a return to NYFW.”

The company also said that it’s putting in place an industry first by its catwalk show being live-streamed into the global Roblox community of over 50 million daily users, accompanied by avatars dressed in looks from the collections “who will take over the remixed virtual city of New York”.

The brand’s Roblox partnership launched last December and as this new development shows, is continuing to evolve.

While the main event happens in NYC on the runway, the company said that the collection will also be brought to life elsewhere — from New York itself and  ""European capitals to Chengdu, and beyond"" — with new retail concepts in select brand stores. And there will also be takeovers with key wholesale and pureplay e-tail partners worldwide to complement the ‘phygital’ showcase. 

“Partnerships with global talent will debut on and off the runway, heroing Tommy Hilfiger’s roots in shaking up prep classics,” the company added.

Every style on the real runway will be available to buy globally, as will the digital product exclusives on Roblox.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 12, 2022","Italian luxury brand Diesel announced on Monday it plans to open its upcoming Milan fashion show to the general public, scheduled for this September.The Diesel Spring/Summer 2023 collection, under the creative direction of Glenn Martens, is slated to take place on September 21, as part of the Milan fashion week calendar. Now, in a company first, any person wanting to attend will have the opportunity to experience the show live on a first come, first serve basis, through an online registration process on the brand's website. Registration opens September 1.

In addition to the live show ticket allocations, the show will also be livestreamed on Diesel’s own digital channels. The co-ed show will be the second collection showing from Martens, after making his debut for Diesel as creative director in February in Milan as part of the Fall/Winter 2022 season. That was followed up by a retake of the Milanese show in Tokyo in June.Diesel's Milan fashion week show news comes two months after the OTB-owned brand announced the appointment of Eraldo Poletto to be its new global CEO.

OTB announced net sales for 2021 amounted to 1.456 billion euro, for an increase of 18% from 2020. In addition to Diesel, the company controls Jil Sander, Marni, Viktor & Rolf, and Maison Margiela, among othersCopyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 11, 2022","While Haute Couture Week and the marathon of fashion shows has come to an end, decisions are being made about the future of two major Parisian fashion houses behind closed doors: Nina Ricci, which parted ways with its artistic directors Lisi Herrebrugh and Rushemy Botter earlier this year, and Louis Vuitton, which is looking for a successor to Virgil Abloh for its menswear collections following his untimely death on November 28, 2021. According to our sources, after numerous exploratory leads, both have drawn up a shortlist of candidates and are close to making a final decision.In early May, luxury streetwear brand Off-White, founded in 2013 by Virgil Abloh and owned by LVMH, announced the appointment of Ibrahim, known as 'Ib', Kamara as art and image director. The Sierra Leonean-born Kamara, who has lived in London since the age of 16, is also the editor-in-chief of the British fashion magazine Dazed and was one of Abloh's longtime collaborators. It was therefore a choice focused on continuity that was favored. However, Virgil Abloh's successor as head of Louis Vuitton's menswear department seems to follow a different logic.

Given the importance of the luxury house, which along with Dior is one of the crown jewels of Bernard Arnault's empire, but also and above all due to the greatness of the iconic designer and the legacy he left behind, the new artistic direction chosen will inevitably have a symbolic impact.With Virgil Abloh, the only black designer at the helm of a major luxury label - along with Olivier Rousteing at Balmain - LVMH has set new standards. Since 2018, its flagship brand has expanded its appeal and audience to new generations and target groups, reshaping its universe around fashion, multiculturalism and social movements.

Seven months have passed since the death of its creative director, during which Louis Vuitton has presented two menswear collections riding on the legacy left by Virgil Abloh. Some believe that the house may take some time before making a decision. After all, LVMH did let a year go by before appointing Maria Grazia Chiuri as head of Christian Dior after the departure of Raf Simons.

""They are not in a big hurry, especially since sales are going very well and the team in place is performing well,"" revealed a group executive.
 
On the other hand, expectations are high and, according to our sources, the group has looked at a dozen candidates. As CEO Michael Burke himself admitted to the press in early June, after Louis Vuitton's last Spring/Summer 2023 show, the house should ""take the next step.""

According to various sources, a handful of potential names have remained in the running, with Martine Rose leading the pack. The English designer of Jamaican descent has been at the top of the list ever since the Paris label's CEO was spotted in the front row at her fashion show in London in June, Vogue Business revealed.

The 41-year-old has considerable experience. She has been running her own menswear brand since 2007. With her penchant for oversized volumes long before they became fashionable, and her sporty, street and workwear style that draws from subcultures and the nineties, her style does not differ greatly from Abloh's. Like the American designer, she is popular with rappers and celebrities and has collaborated with Nike on several occasions. Her resume also includes a three-year stint between 2015 and 2017 at Balenciaga, where she worked as a menswear consultant alongside creative director Demna Gvasalia.
 ""Martine Rose is an unparalleled menswear professional, one of the best creatives in the segment today. She has reached a true stylistic level of maturity. Not to mention the fact that she has worked with a major luxury house while running her own business,"" stressed a key player in the market who knows her well. If appointed, it would allow Louis Vuitton to ensure a smooth transition while innovating thanks to the designer's disruptive touch. It would also be the first time in the company's history that a woman has taken charge of the men's collections.

In addition to Martine Rose, the names of Samuel Ross and Grace Wales Bonner, two other highly regarded talents on the London scene, are also circulating. The 31-year-old Ross began his career in fashion with Virgil Abloh, with whom he was close friends and for whom he worked as a creative assistant at Off-White and Kanye West's Yeezy in the early 2010s. He subsequently launched his own brand, A-Cold-Wall*, in 2015, offering avant-garde couture streetwear. He has been a finalist in prestigious competitions such as Andam and the LVMH Prize, and is known for his sophisticated and conceptual approach to celebrating London street culture inspired by the British middle and working classes, their environment and their clothing habits. The multi-faceted designer has also worked with Nike and Louis Vuitton, collaborating with other artists to redesign the brand's famous trunk to mark the bicentennial of its founder.
 
Jamaican on her father's side and English on her mother's, the 31-year-old Grace Wales Bonner founded her brand in 2014 and from the beginning emphasized in her designs her black identity and African inspirations. She quickly made a name for herself when she won the 2016 LVMH Prize for emerging designers. Known for her cultural sensitivity and multidisciplinary approach, she recently designed a collection for Adidas and collaborated with Maria Grazia Chiuri on Dior's Cruise Collection 2020.

Californian Mike Amiri, who can be seen on the runway in Paris with his glamorous and rocking luxury sportswear brand Amiri, is also said to be one of the contenders.

The group also has another candidate in mind. Jonathan Anderson has been traded as an obvious candidate for months. The 37-year-old Irish designer is more popular than ever, whether with his brand J.W. Anderson, founded in 2008, or with Loewe, the Spanish luxury house owned by LVMH, whose style he has been leading since 2013. His innovative approach, his freshness, his ability to manage several projects at once (he has collaborated with Moncler, among others) as well as his passion for craftsmanship and accessories are all assets for the position to be filled. Not to mention his familiarity with the Parisian group, which could benefit from a very innovative and solid profile.Nina Ricci in search of a new creative talentMajor changes are afoot at Nina Ricci. The Parisian fashion house, owned by the Spanish Puig Group, has been undergoing an organizational restructuring process for several months. After the resignation of its CEO Charlotte Tasset, it also had to cope with the departure of its artistic directors Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh earlier this year. The Dutch duo, hired in 2018, were virtually unknown at the time and had just won the Grand Prix at the Festival de Hyères. Within four years, the pair had breathed new life into the brand, bringing freshness and modernity, but they seemed to have failed to boost sales sufficiently. According to our sources, the selection process for a new artistic direction is also well underway.Initially, the label considered changing its format and focusing on collaborations with different creative talents. In May, Edwin Bodson was named general manager and Nina Ricci returned to the idea of a more traditional artistic direction.

""Discussions are currently taking place with various candidates. The decision should be made shortly,"" revealed an executive within the Puig Group.

The house is extremely discreet about this information. However, as FashionNetwork.com has learned, the choice is said to have initially fallen on Bianca Saunders. The British woman of Jamaican descent has managed to establish herself as one of the most interesting designers of the moment, reinterpreting menswear codes into a wardrobe adapted for both men and women. The 2021 Andam Prize winner was mentored for a year by Balenciaga CEO Cédric Charbit and has been parading on the Paris catwalks since January.

However, Nina Ricci is said not to have made up its mind and decided to resume the search. Various sources mention as candidates in the running, among others, EgonLab, the label of Frenchmen Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix. The two designers, who also specialize in ready-to-wear, reinterpreting tailoring with sportswear and a dash of punk, were honored last year in the Andam competition, winning the Pierre Bergé prize. They have already entered into collaborations with brands such as Sergio Tacchini or, more recently, Crocs, but are especially proactive in the metaverse and in NFTs. This could be a tipping point, as it is said that digitalization will be at the forefront of future development projects carried out by the Spanish Puig Group.

The wait should not last much longer: According to one of our sources, the next artistic director of the house should be announced in September.

"Jul 8, 2022","In a large fashion store in central Kyiv, a mother and her young daughter flick through T-shirts depicting a cartoon dog in a flak jacket and sunglasses.""We have several like this,"" says Tatiana, adding that they may pick up something new.

""We love clothes like this so we shop here often.""The T-shirts by Kyiv-based label J.Cook depict Patron, a Jack Russell dog skilled at finding landmines, who was awarded a medal by President Volodymyr Zelensky in May.

""I like little Patron,"" Tatiana's daughter Valeriya says, as her mother nods.

A trend for patriotic clothing in Ukraine sees T-shirt designs and slogans swiftly pick up on the latest weaponry and war developments.

J.Cook's founder, Serhii Fiut, says the Patron T-shirt is ""currently the most popular"" for the brand, named after British explorer James Cook, which sews garments in western Ukraine.

""In 90 percent of cases, people choose military-themed T-shirts,"" the 34-year-old businessman says, sitting in a Georgian cafe in Kyiv.

""It's like a means of expression. People want to show that 'this is close to me'"".

Sales of T-shirts are growing, Fiut said.

""I have a niche where people are ready to buy.""

Many who buy online are women getting T-shirts for partners and relatives fighting in the war, he adds.

At the large store Vsi Svoi (All Ours) on Kyiv's main shopping street -- which showcases Ukraine designers -- there is a wide choice of war-themed clothing.

A mannequin near the entrance wears a T-shirt showing a US Javelin anti-tank missile on a background of stylised flowers, designed by another Kyiv-based label, SIL' wear.

Mariya Iakniunas, 31, the brand's co-owner says the design, known as ""Talisman"", is one of the brand's most popular.

It is inspired by the Ukrainian peasant tradition of hanging up towels embroidered with bright flowers to ward off bad luck, she said.

""Today, the Javelin in the hands of our warriors is the talisman of every Ukrainian,"" she says, hence the idea to surround it with flowers.

She insists that the popularity of such designs ""is not a trend, it's our voice... This is our unity. To be Ukrainians and to win this war.""

While SIL' wear saw its sales drop in the first month of the war, they are now ""recovering powerfully,"" she says.

Both J. Cook and SIL'wear donate part of their proceeds to the armed forces.

- 'People get it' -

Several T-shirt designs mock Russia's wilder propaganda claims -- such as reports of genetically modified geese and pigeons being used as biological weapons.

One by J.Cook shows aggressive-looking pigeons wearing tank helmets and a cartridge belt, while a gaggle of geese tout rifles and peer through binoculars in another design from the label.

""They (Russians) themselves give us ideas for drawings,"" says Fiut.

""Where are these pigeons and biological laboratories? What are they talking about? We are trying to show this irony, to mock it. People get it.""

Customers are eager to wear their support for the war on their chests.

""There's a lot of beautiful T-shirts,"" says 14-year-old Mykola, shopping at Vsi Svoi, saying he and his friends wear them.

They send ""a certain message and that's why it's important to wear them"", he says.

- 'So patriotic' -

At a pop-up event at a trendy Kyiv showroom called Kapsula, or capsule, T-shirts, sweaters, hoodies and jewellery by Ukrainian designers feature the national flag colours, blue and yellow.

""Everything is so patriotic now,"" says administrator Anna Perebynos, 22.

""We hold such events so people know more about our Ukrainian designers who are working now, who are putting out new collections despite what is happening now in our country.""

On display is a soft hoodie by MY x MY featuring an embroidered map of Ukraine with the slogan: ""Places for happy people"".

A T-shirt by Balcony Garment shows a Russian rocket with nuclear symbols juxtaposed on doves and flowers with the slogan: ""Here and now.""

Perebynos shows clothes to be shipped online including folk-embroidered blouses and linen items in blue and yellow.

""We get a lot of international orders: it's people who may have been born here in Ukraine and it's their home but for some reason, they've gone abroad.""

Patriotism in Kyiv even extends to makeup, with some women wearing yellow and blue flicks of eyeliner, she says, laughing.

""Now it's a very large global trend. It shows that people are really supporting us.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

As part of this partnership, Trussardi has committed to hire “new candidates with a multicultural background,” to organise mentorship and training programmes for emerging talents and the AFA community, as well as to jointly stage a cycle of workshops with AFA, as the two parties indicated in a press release.“This agreement represents a very important step for us in broadening and asserting our commitment to promote inclusivity and plurality policies, both inside and outside the company,” said CEO Sebastian Suhl, describing AFA as “an ideal partner, with whom we share a vision and values.” For AFA, collaborating with an established label like Trussardi means significant recognition, and will surely give the association greater visibility, helping it push forward its projects.

The exhibit will run from September 10 through January 30, 2023 at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. It will feature over 90 designers and iconic American labels such as pieces on loan from Vogue magazine's global editor at large, Hamish Bowles, plus other private collections and household names such as Ralph Lauren, Nike, Vera Wang, and Levi Strauss alongside statement-making styles by designers Virgil Abloh, Carolina Herrera, Patricia Michaels, Virgil Ortiz, Anna Sui, and Isabel Toledo. 

It aims to explore and celebrate the diversity of the country’s fashion heritage and spirit of invention. Along the way, it spotlights the untold stories of underrecognized and underrepresented designers, important contemporary movements shaping the industry, and American fashion’s resonance in global trends and visual culture.“American fashion reflects the complexity of America writ large, weaving together stories of innovation, immigration, independence, self-invention, and creativity. The sweeping story of American fashion encompasses designers from all walks of life — from the rural to the urban, from the regional to the global — who embody history past and present and represent issues related to inclusion and exclusion,” said the exhibition’s curator, Michelle Tolini Finamore. 

“I am honored and excited to have the opportunity to champion work that has too often been overlooked by convention and hope that the exhibition captures the role fashion plays in reflecting the American spirit to the rest of the world.”

In particular, the expanse of American fashion is explored through seven themed sections from denim jeans to bathing suits, sneakers to cowboy boots, zoot suits to leisure suits, sportswear to underwear, and Hollywood glamour to street style. 

The exhibition also emphasizes the work of Black and Native American designers and features geographical representation of fashion designers and histories from across the country.

The introduction of the exhibit was made alongside the announcement of a new partnership with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.

"Jul 7, 2022","With the ""Barbie"" movie currently filming in California, the world's most famous doll is imposing her signature style on the catwalks, red carpets, and even our wardrobes, reinvigorating certain stereotypes thought dead and buried.Women have decided to move on from the comfort of sweatpants to embrace more extravagant clothing styles, bright colors and mismatched patterns. All things pink, ultra-short, ultra-tight and ultra-kitsch appear to be on a mission to conquer our wardrobes this summer, as part of a trend called ""Barbiecore.""

""Life in plastic, it's fantastic""Recently the goth look, hiker style, the 'weird girl' aesthetic, the minimalism of the 'coastal grandmother' and sporty fashion were among the main trends of the season. But ""Barbiecore"" seems to be the absolute antithesis of all these trends, focusing on a stereotypical wardrobe in the extreme, channeling fun, glamour and ramped up femininity.

Pink is the new Black

This aesthetic, inspired by Barbie's world, above all translates into an explosion of pink, a color already adopted by a host of stars across the Atlantic. Megan Fox didn't miss the opportunity to step out in the shade when attending the premiere of the documentary about her dear and beloved Machine Gun Kelly, aptly titled  ""Life in Pink."" She took to the red carpet in a Barbie-esque outfit. An experience that she repeated the following days on the streets of New York.

But the American actress is far from the only one taking style cues from Barbie. Hailey Bieber posted a picture on Instagram showing her wearing an outfit directly inspired by the world of the famous doll -- a pink skin-tight mini-dress and XXL platform boots. 





Similarly, the now blonde Kim Kardashian went as far as accessorizing her metallic pink outfit with a matching handbag adorned with multiple glittering embellishments. It's hard to get more kitsch, and that's probably -- precisely -- the appeal here! Meanwhile her sister Khloe posted pictures of herself looking like Barbie in a pink latex minidress with pink shoes and blonde locks. After two particularly gloomy years, the idea is to show off and have fun, summer being the ideal season to do both.



A lasting trend? 

Even if this Barbie fad doesn't last, the fall season could still be tinged with her favorite shade -- pink. The fall-winter 2022 shows proved a real ode to the vibrant color, starting with Valentino, which splashed the shade on dozens of looks, both in women's and men's styles. But the fashion house isn't alone in bringing pink to its collections. Michael Kors, Versace, Act No. 1 and Dolce & Gabbana are among the brands that hope to keep rose-tinted fashion on the agenda for a few more months.

"Jul 4, 2022","The house of Pierre Cardin celebrated what would have been the 100th birthday of its founder on Saturday, July 2. The trailblazing couturier, who passed away at the end of 2020, not only became a fashion icon transcending all areas of design and culture, but left a rich legacy behind him. His empire-sized creative legacy is currently undergoing a relaunch adapted to modern times through its extensive licensing network.After having celebrated a comeback on a high note with a futuristic fashion show at the foot of a rocket, staged at Le Bourget last January, the label headed back to the designer's native Italy. More specifically to Palazzo Ca'Bragadin in Venice, a sophisticated 1000-square-meter space that Cardin himself acquired in 1981. Located just a few minutes away from the Rialto Bridge, the palace that once saw the very Casanova dance in its halls welcomed 300 guests from all over the world, including celebrities, journalists and the firm's own employees.

Among them were also the stars of the evening: around 120 licensees (about half of those that work with the company worldwide) that Pierre Cardin gathered together for the first time after the pandemic. In addition to commemorating the founder's birthday, the aim of the event was to ""lay the foundations for a new creative relationship"".Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, the grand-nephew of the couturier and CEO of the company, explained: ""The idea of this fashion show is to create a new way of working with our licensees, to share the creative process from the very beginning. We want to be able to inspire them to come up with our ideas afterwards. We have to collaborate hand in hand so that they can create products that reflect the Cardin identity"". The brand's business model is based on creating exclusive collections and staging fashion shows in order to federate, inspire and encourage its licensee partners.

The challenge ahead for the heir is no small feat. ""As of today, licensees sell more entry-level products, sometimes even nameless ones. They only carry the Cardin label. I want our brand to be recognizable,"" said Basilicati-Cardin.

""And this is something that sometimes just requires some attention to detail. From a creative point of view, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We haven't visited the factories in 25 years. My uncle couldn't handle it, but he didn't delegate the task either. His success and independence depended on everything revolving around him. Now we have to travel again, catch up and visit our licensees a year and a half before launching our collections. The results are not immediate,"" he argued, stressing the need to return to the catwalk and into the media spotlight.The retrospective collection, entitled ""Cent"", presented a contemporary reinterpretation of the brand's classic codes, a play on volumes, geometric contrasts and space-age ready-to-wear looks for everyday wear made 50% from recycled fabrics. The house's collections, which represent a limited part of the company's turnover, are only on sale at its store in Paris located on rue Saint-Honoré.

""Pierre Cardin always said that copying is never okay unless you're copying yourself. And the maison has quite an extensive heritage,"" quipped the man in charge of leading a new chapter in the company's history, while trying to stay true to its very essence. To this end, Basilicati-Cardin intends to encourage the use of sustainable, recycled or deadstock fabrics among the collections produced by its licensees and to foster local production ""as much as possible"".

""No matter how eco-friendly the fabrics are, the products have to be profitable at the end of the day. We must support start-ups that work with new materials at a decent price,"" pointed out the entrepreneur, insisting on the difficulties he faces when it comes to finding affordable fabrics and convincing licensees to use them. ""Thirty years ago, my uncle asked me to launch our own textile collection that all our licensees could work with and source from. I now want to make this a reality with new and sustainable materials,"" he said, insisting that being competitive means carrying large quantities.The company's goals in terms of transforming itself extend beyond the textile world. The maison wants to avoid falling into oblivion by making itself known and even seducing a younger audience via the metaverse, with a project that will see the light of day in six months' time.

""My uncle was always interested in innovation. And I find the prospect of expanding into a tech company very appealing. We don't need our licensees to develop virtual reality. And creating wearable NFTs is not expensive. It's a good starting point for attracting a younger audience,"" Basilicati-Cardin explained, acknowledging the current limitations of producing virtual fashion.

In any case, the company is planning to keep up with modern times without making any radical changes. When faced with the possibility of developing the retail or wholesale business, Basilicati-Cardin stood by his original idea of continuing to work more closely with licensees. His agenda does not include appointing a creative director to bring a fresh vision to the brand.

""We believe in our studio. I don't see why we should change our strategy. It would be wrong to hire a creative director only to force him to make collections solely imitating the style of Pierre Cardin,"" said the heir. While the viability of the business model or whether its garments will ever again grace the streets has yet to be confirmed, the brand is planning to present its next collection at a fashion show in Paris in March 2023 that will coincide with the reopening of its flagship store after a major renovation.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 4, 2022","Adidas Originals is linking up again with London-based MrBailey “to ignite the start of an ongoing partnership that will see the innovative designer reimagine the Trefoil’s futuristic Ozworld family of silhouettes”.The collab will include “unexpected product launches, behind-the-scenes content, and much more still to come” with announcements appearing for consumers via the sports giant’s Confirmed app.

MrBailey is the founder of innovative footwear design studio ConceptKicks with the company being drawn to the “nomadic by nature… progressive creator’s practice [that] specialises in an approach to footwear innovation that is distinctly speculative in thinking and undeniably boundary pushing in execution”.The label first collaborated with MrBailey on the “iconoclastic SST Ammonite shoe as part of the brand’s Catalyst for Change program in 2020”.The partners have this time used the “biological research that informed the SST Ammonite silhouette” as the starting point and are informed by the ethos “nature is our greatest luxury”.

They said the collaborative partnership will “explore the innate systems of design within the marine habitat. Building on the inherent wonder and beauty of aquatic lifeforms through design techniques, the partnership promises to challenge the artificial distinction between man made production and the natural world”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 4, 2022","On June 29, Alexandre Mattiussi and Nicolas Santi-Weil, founder and CEO of Ami, respectively, together with Xavier Romatet, general manager of the Institut Français de la Mode, presented the first entrepreneurship prize at the French fashion school.From among 10 finalists, the AmiXIFM prize crowned two young entrepreneurs for their innovative work on leather: Guillaume Hiriart Carriat, founder of the brand Atxi who uses the know-how of his family-owned workshop based in Espelette, and Leopolda Contaux-Bellina, founder of Sed Nove Studio, a young company certified by the Métiers d'art that develops innovations on leather.

""We met at the incubator and we naturally shared our outlook and approach around our businesses,"" the duo explained to FashionNetwork.com. ""And when there was an opportunity to submit a project we logically worked together."" The winners combined material expertise, using dormant leather stocks from Carriat's family workshop with an innovative process designed by Sed Nove for assembling laser-cut leather pieces without wires or rivets. This fundamentally high-end approach, using Atxi's signature zigzag pattern, has been applied to five objects of various shapes and sizes, from a shaker to a chair, posing a challenge to the project's creators to find technical solutions for using buffalo leather.

Ultimately, the concept combining innovation and traditional know-how, and extending far beyond fashion, seduced the jury members who were keen to explore opportunities outside of fashion.

The goal of this prize was to highlight the projects of students and young entrepreneurs incubated at IFM. Of the approximately 20 candidates, 10 were chosen to present their work to a jury composed of prominent figures from the world of creation, art, music, and cinema. The panel of judges included Nicolas Santi-Weil and Alexandre Mattiussi, as well as Sarah Andelman, founder of the Just An Idea agency, writer Leila Slimani, Ubisoft director Déborah Papiernik, composer Max Sokolinski, author Irma Pany, Pierre-Alexandre M'Pelé, head of editorial content at GQ France, Elisha Karmitz, CEO of the MK2 group, and Delphine Plisson, of the Maison Plisson grocery store. All of these individuals brought their own unique approach to a fashion award.

""We didn't want to create just another award,"" explained Romatet. ""The fact that we have such a wide range of people bringing their perspectives and being able to mentor the winners over the next 12 months is an invigorating experience and I think we will do it again. Accompanying entrepreneurs in fashion is also at the heart of IFM's mission. There are students and entrepreneurs who have ideas to reinvent the industry. Looking at these presentations, regardless of the winner, I'm very proud of the projects and of highlighting a young generation with new ideas and concepts"".

The jury also awarded a special prize to the young company Studio Paillette, which has been operating for two months in La Caserne in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. Studio Paillette, founded by Léa Germano who worked on the presentation of the project with five students, is a rental service for high-end fashion pieces that collaborates with fashion houses to allow them to rent out pieces that have not yet been sold.

""With IFM, we are committed to involving young professionals and encouraging them to initiate a decision-making process by making them aware of the opportunities they can generate as entrepreneurs,"" said Santi-Weil.

It was clearly the search for new innovative ideas rather than just fashion that distinguished the candidates' presentations in this first AmiXIFM competition. At a time when the industry's accelerated transformation is necessary, highlighting new ideas is essential. And why not make expand the project for future editions and help boost the best ideas' success by allocating a financial endowment to the first round of mentoring.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 29, 2022","The pandemic is ending, and men are once again keen to dress up. “Let's go out!” was the imperative of the menswear show session that ended on June 26. Going for an evening jaunt, of course, because a convivial mood is back. But going out during the day too, to enjoy the outside world again with sporting pursuits, immersions in nature and sun-kissed holidays by the seaside.

The Spring/Summer 2023 collections unveiled in London, Florence, Milan and Paris, nearly all of them with in-person shows, stood out for their freshness and laid-back elegance, marking a return to more formal outfits that nevertheless aren't jettisoning the comfort they gained during lockdowns. Also, next summer’s menswear showcased in even more distinct fashion the feminine element in men, though still with a humorous nod to certain masculine archetypes, as in cowboy and biker outfits.1 - Laid-back suits

Suits are officially back in favour. Every man in the third millennium must have a suit in his wardrobe, the jacket matching with either trousers, shorts or Bermudas. Naturally, after the lockdowns and the explosion of streetwear, suits are back in new guises, made with lighter and softer materials, featuring extremely ample trousers often fastened with a drawstring, and with deconstructed blazers. Next summer, owing to global warming, they will be preferably worn mismatched and over a bare chest. Suits are genuine must, seen on every runway.2 - Bare bellies

Bare chests and bellies are more than a passing whim, they are well and truly setting the tone for next summer. After enjoying great success in womenswear in recent summer seasons, the crop top is sneaking into men’s wardrobes, as evidenced by ever-shrinking tops laying bare gentlemen's navels and six-packs. Clothes stop abruptly just below the chest. Not only vests, t-shirts, sweaters, and sundry tight-fitting knitwear and jerseys, but also shirts and jackets, including dinner jackets. Fendi and Miu Miu paved the way in Spring/Summer 2022, savagely slashing down their jackets. Now everyone else is doing it, from MSGM to Amiri, LGN Louis-Gabriel Nouchi, Thom Browne, Moschino, VTMNTS and Mowalola, to mention but a few.
 3 - Distressed jeans

Denim has been making a come-back in the last few seasons, but next summer it will take over the entire wardrobe in a plethora of versions, from heavily distressed to uber-formal. Denim is featured in all types of garments, including coats and boots, like the oversize thigh-high boots cut from old denim strips seen at Dolce & Gabbana. Stone-washed jeans, scruffy and threadbare, are making a notable come-back. Not to mention ripped jeans, wonderfully reinterpreted by Japanese label Taakk, which amusingly mimicked tears by using embroidery.4 - Terry cloth

Serial heatwaves are calling for new solutions. Designers have redoubled their efforts in fabric research to find the lightest, freshest and most pleasant materials, with cotton ubiquitous and linen enjoying a revival. In this context, terry cloth, preferably recycled, adds a uniquely summery touch. Among the most attractive examples, the shirt-trouser sets at Marine Serre, the bathrobe coats at Gunther and LGN, and the towels wrapped around the waist like a skirt, at Magliano. 
5 - Leather mini-shorts

First introduced last year, slightly retro minuscule shorts are now very much on-trend. The novelty is that next summer they will need to be made of leather, ideally black leather. Prada built almost the entire collection around this item, featuring mini shorts fastened with double zips. At Walter Van Beirendonck, they come fringed with thick strips. At EgonLab, they sometimes look like knickers.
 6 - Papa's pyjamas

Pyjama suits were already a thing last year, primarily in silky materials and for evening wear. Next summer, they will be worn in effortlessly chic day looks too. When the temperature rises and we want comfort, no need to complicate things, we can go out wearing pyjamas. Provided they are one of those fine old-fashioned pyjamas in light poplin with thin sky-blue stripes. Givenchy used this fabric to concoct a directional total look with shirt, shorts and gloves. Loose trousers in striped cotton with an elasticated waistband are all the rage, especially since they easily combine with pretty much everything.7 - The sarong

A long piece of fabric tied at the waist pareo-fashion, the sarong has become a menswear staple as an alternative to skirts, and was featured in most men’s collections for Spring/Summer 2023. Gender boundaries are blurring, and consumers are constantly seeking greater comfort. From the white towels adopted by Dolce & Gabbana and Magliano, to Craig Green’s quilted carpet fabric and Hed Mayner’s recycled lace tablecloth, there was something for everyone. Including a more rebellious style - a big belt cinching a black fabric swathe at Moschino - or Dsquared2’s unashamedly cool one, with a brightly coloured floral sarong slipped nonchalantly under a jacket.8 - Trompe-l’œil effects

A joyful zest was sprinkled across all collections, without going to extremes of eccentricity. Just a desire to have fun, smile, amuse oneself. It translated into clothes featuring vibrant, unexpected prints, often inspired by the art world, as in the Pop Art collection by Junya Watanabe. Designers also resorted to trompe l’œil effects, sketching make-believe garments on essential wardrobe items (Y/Project, Maison Mihara Yasuhiro and Moschino), or reproducing anatomical details, as if the wearer was stripping naked.9 - Cowboy looks

Cowboy looks aptly represent this festive mood, marked by a return to a rather creative way of dressing. The entire amusing gamut of cowboy outfits has visibly inspired designers, who went for boots, ten-gallon hats, embroidered trousers and tassel-trimmed shirts, belts with oversize buckles or medallions, and typical leather bolo ties. Even a stirrup cropped up at Craig Green! Above all, chaps have tickled the designers’ imagination. These overtrousers cowboys slip over jeans to protect them will be worn next summer on bare skin, affording a glimpse of sexy underwear. They come braided and tasselled at Thom Browne, in indigo, daisy-embroidered denim at Casablanca, strictly in leather at Celine.10 - Quirky accessories
 
Accessories swamped the runways in all shapes and sizes, worn from head to toe, often with a playful vibe. After two crisis years, what better outlet to channel a return to consumer purchases that labels hope will be compulsive? From Kenzo’s elephant trunk tie to EgonLab’s ear clip/cigarette holder, to J.W. Anderson’s skateboard sweaters and handlebars round the neck, the wildest ideas have cropped up on the runways in the first real shows post-Covid.

"Jun 29, 2022","The Spanish accent was heard loud and clear in Paris. Spanish menswear collections claimed their own space within the busy agenda of Paris fashion week, which concluded with the Celine fashion show on Sunday, June 26. The Spanish designers presented pieces that contemporarized classic tailoring or that challenged traditional ideas of gender.Arturo Obegero: a love letter to AsturiasYouth, talent and dedication are words that describe the Paris-based Asturian designer Arturo Obegero. The designer graduated from the prestigious Central Saint Martins school in 2018 and now boasts a brilliant career that has led him to join the ranks of Lanvin or present the first fashion show of his eponymous brand in March 2020, just before the outbreak of the pandemic. However, his big leap into the media spotlight would not come until April this year, when singer Harry Styles wore one of his red sequined jumpsuits in the music video for his long-awaited single ""As it was"".His theatrical and thought-provoking designs returned to Paris Fashion Week with an interactive presentation at the Neoramart gallery on Thursday, June 23. As a love letter to Tapia de Casariego, his hometown, Obegero paid tribute to the landscapes of his land, a natural enviornment endangered by the opening of a gold mine. Entitled ""Song to the Siren"", in reference to the song by the English band This Mortal Coil, the collection was tinted with colors ranging from lilac to yellow, as well as various shades of blue. The color palette was a far cry from the brand's usual chromatic intensity.

The soft colors also brought more relaxed and ethereal silhouettes, creating a romantic wardrobe inspired by the work of surrealist artists Man Ray and René Magritte, featuring long white silk shirts, the brand's signature high-waisted pants, asymmetrical draped tops, an electric blue skirt that fell seductively, double-breasted suits or a white set of feathers surrounding the chest, sleeves or trouser bottoms, which was undoubtedly one of the most striking looks of the collection, for which Obegero was inspired by a mythological being from his region known as the Espumeru, a goblin who hides in caves by the sea. 

Among the attendees at the presentation was Harry Lambert, the stylist behind the former One Direction singer's media-worthy looks. Two eye-catching jumpsuits that Harry Styles will surely covet awaited him: a strapless scarlet jumpsuit and a black high-necked jumpsuit embroidered with sparkly details resembling a starry sky.Oteyza: from classic tailoring to ""street à couture""After his last four digital editions, Oteyza returned to a physical format at Paris Fashion Week with an interactive presentation organized at the Spanish Embassy in the French capital, in which the designer himself guided and positioned the mannequins. The brand's ""return to the stage"" celebrated its sixth participation in the fashion week by presenting its Spring/Summer ""Aire"" collection with a video shot in the Trocadero Gardens, just at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Inspired by shapes in movement and Raoul Dufy's colorful paintings, the garments were rendered in bright blue, pearl gray, fuchsia, beige or the brand's signature deep black. 

The 25 looks stayed true to the fabrics the brand usually uses, from merino wool to linen, including cotton and silk, which were adapted to more contemporary pieces such as deconstructed jackets featuring architectural cuts and flowing drapes, capes with ribbons, pleated pants fastened to legs with ties, elegant Bermuda shorts, skirts, Cordovan hats or overlapping elements creating different volumes and asymmetries. 

""We wanted to present functional yet very elegant garments, without sacrificing our sartorial essence and elaborate tailoring. There is a place in streetwear for sophisticated designs that can coexist with more casual ones,"" explained Caterina Pañeda, co-founder of the company, which was founded in 2012. The latest collection once again included several pairs of minimalist sneakers and introduced, for the first time, accessible pieces such as polo shirts and T-shirts. ""We started as a more niche brand but we are gradually moving closer to the more mainstream market,"" added Paul García de Oteyza, who is also a driving force behind the firm, stressing the importance of maintaining a ""touch of craftsmanship"" and the brand's ""sartorial heritage"".

The brand, which sold a minority stake in its capital to the Perfumes y Diseño group in 2021, has several projects lined up ahead. In addition to planning to develop its own fragrance together with the Perfumes y Diseño group led by Pedro Trólez, the firm is planning to internationalize its business through its new showroom in Paris, No Season. ""We are a family business and are taking a step-by-step approach to expansion,"" explained the creative duo, who are setting their sights on the Asian market. 

The Madrid-based firm has a trick up its sleeve to accompany this project: a contemporary conceptual musical with the National Ballet inspired by the fashion show staged in 2018 which will reflect the cultural and economic importance of merino sheep. ""Fashion is all about ephemerality and we want to rely on the value of culture,"" said the duo. The show will travel to several cities, but will not premiere until next year.Alled-Martinez's Metrosexual pleaArchie, or in other words Alled-Martinez, is on everyone's lips. The Barcelona-born Central Saint Martins graduate was not content with having just presented his first capsule collection for Karl Lagerfeld, and has become a main character in ""First Class,"" Netflix's latest reality TV show that follows a group of friends who are passionate about luxury and fashion. In addition, the former winner of the 2018 LVMH Fashion Student Prize presented his latest collection, ""Reclaiming The Fields,"" on the closing day of Paris fashion week, with an event organized at the Palais de Tokyo.

Under the idea of ""reclaiming the term metrosexual"", a terwhich often veils a homophobic tone, the designer who previously worked at Givenchy reinterpreted the iconic silhouettes of the 00's with a modern twist and with a great deal of ""camp"". The collection featured homoerotic imagery with soccer locker rooms as a backdrop for models wearing pink vichy sleeveless shirts, double denim and unbuttoned knickerbockers, short fitted tops, double layered long sleeve tees, wide peach leather polyester cargo pants and nylon taffeta zippered shirts. The brand's classic knitwear returned with a new take on its iconic stretch knit pants, but this time with a low rise.

The accessories deserve a special mention, which included XXL bags in denim, black canvas or raw silk macramé, as well as belts made by the artisan Alicia Medina. Swimwear was also included in the collection, with retro pieces made in viscose or stretch denim.Mans: an explosion of colors and patternsIn the days prior to its fashion show in Madrid, to be held next Wednesday, June 29, ""Roots"", the latest collection of the men's firm Mans traveled to Paris for the first time. Presented at the Boon showroom, a few steps from Bastille, the lineup designed by Sevillian designer Jaime Alvarez excelled for its unique prints and its strong mix of colors, ranging from orange to fuchsia and electric blue.

Known for its classic tailoring with loose and relaxed fits and its ""Made in Spain"" designs, the firm founded in 2017 experimented with new silhouettes and cuts, which included structured boleros, double-breasted jackets and exaggerated lapels, flowing long-sleeved shirts loaded with flowers or tailoring-inspired shorts. Minimalist sandals or the introduction of oversized leather bags with horse silhouette prints stood out among the novelties. The company, already established in Spain as one of the tailoring brands with the greatest potential, is ready to boost its international expansion and broaden its retail network. Austin Butler, the actor starring in the Elvis biopic, is already among the brand's most high-profile clients. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 29, 2022","Puma is looking to consolidate its presence in the United States. The sportswear brand, which is sponsored by a number of famous muses, is set to boost its growth overseas by staging a show at New York Fashion Week. This represents a comeback for the brand, which in 2016 presented its collaboration with Rihanna for Fenty in the Big Apple.The show will be held on September 13 and will once again feature a number of collaborations such as those with Dapper Dan, Palomo or with Koché for the Italian soccer club AC Milan. The event will also be taking place in the virtual realm. This decision comes as no surprise since Puma is currently increasing its involvement in the metaverse and web3, having for example launched a space on the gaming platform Roblox, and more recently entered into a partnership with 10KTF, a shop in the metaverse that sells virtual streetwear products.

""We are thrilled to be collaborating with the CFDA and to be back on the official NYFW calendar,"" said Adam Petrick, global director of brand and marketing at Puma. ""Returning to fashion week for the first time in several years is significant for us because we knew we needed the right combination of factors to be present. With an emphasis on digital, a great lineup of ambassadors and an amazing creative partner in June Ambrose, the foundation and creativity for a great show are there. And we're excited that this can be the moment for us to bring it to life.""  Puma is planning to present a portion of its Fall/Winter 2022 collection, including products that can be immediately purchased, along with its new items for Spring/Summer 2023. Creative director June Ambrose, who is close to artist/entrepreneur Jay-Z (president of basketball operations at Puma) and who took office in 2020, will be in charge of the creative side of the show.

""My life and work have been rooted in street-culture and the development of the relationship between urban and industrial aesthetics. When I entered the business four decades ago, my mission was to influence generations of people who dream of being visible. It's this perspective that I bring to Puma and reflects my mindset when I curate the Futurograde show,"" explained the American designer. ""I want to connect the emotional narrative of our lives to the show, through the cyclical nature of fashion. I'm excited to see how the audience perceives the way we present the idea of a 'classic forward-looking', tapping into nostalgia and reimagining it for the future. I want this concept to challenge the audience to be creative in their present, while imagining the future.""

Puma has partnered with Future to develop the digital side of this experience. Future's task is to create an original, multi-layered experience that integrates cultural, musical and sport elements. The project has been entrusted to David Stamatis, Future's executive director. Puma's approach and the way it integrates its collaborations, but more importantly its muses, and the business transformation that this may entail will, of course, be under close scrutiny next September.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 28, 2022","Reese Cooper was all smiles the day after the presentation of his ‘Seed and Soil’ Spring/Summer 2023 collection, showcased appropriately at the Jardin des Plantes botanical gardens in Paris, the US designer's first show in the French capital. As part of the show, Cooper officially dropped his first collaboration with Levi’s. The collection was immediately available for sale at a pop-up store in Rue d’Uzès in Paris, and internationally too.Cooper, who founded his RCI label six years ago in Los Angeles, with a focus on workwear and upcycling, had first dipped his toes in Parisian waters, outside the official calendar, in 2018. This time, he came back with a fully fledged collection show.

“We were on the digital show calendar, but this was the first time we were on the [official show] calendar. It’s unreal. It hasn’t fully sunk in yet, there was so much energy. For us it was key, since this is our largest collection to date, featuring nearly 300 items, not counting t-shirts, but it’s also the largest team I’ve ever worked with in the company. It was a culmination of the work done over the last two years, which came to life with this show,” said Cooper.Cooper’s savvy in reinterpreting workwear codes lay of course at the heart of this collection for men and women, evident in the trench coats, jackets and other types of parkas, notably enhanced by modular pockets. Some of the garments were cut in raw fabric, others were patterned with interesting green and blue prints, mixed with some brown, which Coper and his partner designed themselves. Cooper produces his creations at his own Los Angeles-based ateliers, and his style attracted Levi’s during the Covid-19 lockdowns. The show’s first look was the fruit of his work with Levi’s.

“We started on this two years ago,” said Cooper. “This is the first collaboration I said ‘yes’ to with my label. For me, it was the first time I was presented with a real project that had purpose. [Levi’s] allowed me to apply my own touch and materials to their classic silhouettes. Some of the looks are theirs, but have been tweaked by my team, while others were created by me and [Levi’s] then worked on them. It was a genuine exchange. We also worked with what they call deadstock, and we wanted to do something special with these items. But these are limited-edition pieces because, for example, six garments may be needed to create one jacket. What I’m interested in, as with Merrell, with which we can design sneakers, is to be able to work with quality brands with a broad appeal, and bring my own vision to them,” he added.

Karyn Hillman, chief product officer at Levi’s, said: “We struck an instant connection on how to work with fabrics and on sustainability. These are Levi’s items, but clearly infused with Reese’s amazing creativity, mixing function and fashion. We started this project two years ago during the pandemic, planning how to deploy it. Of course, we have a strategic vision on collaborations, but the important thing is that they make sense. The starting point is talking about products, fabrics and archives, sparking the inspiration to create something new. We always want both brands and their narratives to truly come through in a collaboration.”

This collection’s unique feature is that it is being launched in ‘see now, buy now’ mode. It was shown on Wednesday evening, and Levi’s commercialised it from Thursday.

“Nine of this collaboration’s products are already available in Tokyo, Dubai, Shanghai, and at our flagship stores in Paris, Los Angeles and New York,” said Karen Riley-Grant, chief marketing officer at Levi Strauss & Co. “What is important in these collaborations is to make a new line immediately accessible. Prices are appropriate to the products. Levi’s has been committed to greater sustainability for years. But this type of collaboration enables us to deliver the message to consumers, and to generate a greater impact on these topics. Our priority is to be able to connect with customers and communities,” she added.Cooper's label is already commercialised by e-tailers like Mr Porter and Ssense, as well as by Saks, Bodega in Los Angeles, Le Printemps and End.Clothing, and this collaboration is set to give it even greater international visibility and credibility.
 
“I think that right now, even though there is a lot of energy around the brand, we are still building its foundations. I think that’s the most important thing, before we can even think of building something bigger. We are setting up our organisation. There are nine of us, six of whom work at our atelier. My goal is for us to be 15 by the end of the year,” said Cooper.

"Jun 28, 2022","Under its glitzy facade, the Russian high-fashion industry faces an uncertain future.

Scores of Western designer labels have quit Russia as part of a backlash against Moscow's decision to send troops into Ukraine, leaving their domestic competitors to take centre-stage.But at the annual Moscow Fashion Week, which showcases the work of Russian designers, industry professionals said seizing that opportunity would not be easy.

""We need to develop the production of fabrics because our fabrics and accessories are all imported,"" said Yulia Lavrichenko, a fashion stylist taking part in the event last week. ""Unfortunately, our designers are suffering from this for the time being.""Even Russian couturiers rely heavily on Italy to provide the exclusive materials that go into clothing their wealthy clientele.

And while China, Bangladesh, Belarus and Turkey all continue to provide mass-market clothes and materials to Russia, Italy is taking part in European Union sanctions that make trade at the luxury end very difficult.

Olga Sinitsyna, whose brand SCORA designs hats and accessories, said her business was just emerging from the shock of the pandemic when Russia's military campaign began, sending the rouble tumbling and import prices skyrocketing.

The rouble has since bounced back, ""but logistics are 10 times more expensive"", she said, adding that she had been left with no choice but to increase her prices.

""You have to understand that everything you see here is not made from Russian raw materials,"" she said. ""This, of course, affects the cost ... But here the choice is either you do it - or you cry and do nothing. I choose to do it.""

For designer Albina Akkulova, known for fairy tale-inspired dresses embroidered with beads and gold thread, the growing constraints will force designers to come up with creative solutions and innovators to put some of their energy into promoting a domestic fashion manufacturing base.

""For Russia as a whole, it's new possibilities,"" she said, backstage after her brand's runway show. ""We'll create something of our own, develop our own fashion industry.""© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Jun 28, 2022","Paris Fashion Week presented the collections of two lovers of precise and relaxed tailoring: Sir Paul Smith and his '80's-inspired pieces and a French chic lineup by Pierre Mahéo, founder of Officine Générale.Officine Générale explores volumes and fluidityA newfound sense of maturity emanated from Officine Générale’s Spring/Summer 2023 collection. While Mahéo denied having any interest in the 10th anniversary of his Paris-based brand, his relaxed and accessible tailored pieces, presented right after the storm of a late Parisian afternoon in the courtyard of the National Archives Museum, was enriched with voluminous and fluid fabrics. A casual elegant spirit, the materials selected, and the savoir-faire used in the men’s jackets and pants in a color palette ranging from deep black, to celadon green, espresso brown, sand and pale pink, were elements that most notably caught the audience's attention. Both the female and male key pieces were worn with light tone-on-tone shirts or striped tops. Ready for the sea or the desert, the male and female models tied large silk scarves around their necks or in their hair, wearing skin-tight sweaters and cardigans or dresses, pants, and hoodies cinched with drawstrings. They sported leather sandals, nubuck mules or light monochromatic low top sneakers on their feet. This collection enriched Officine Générale's product range with its volumes and materials. The designer dared to offer wider cuts while also exploring greater fluidity in menswear.""Working on the women's collections made us evolve from menswear. I stopped identifying myself in every look I was proposing, otherwise it would only be gray and navy blue and it would get boring. And the color palette functions just the same as the silk or adding width in the pants. But we did this without going overboard with a totally oversized silhouette. I think you can pair a wider jacket with regular pants, and vice versa. These are all evolutions and it's important to be open to new things. We are lucky to have a customer base behind us. Our womenswear is more sophisticated, better constructed than before. We now offer 25 looks compared to the 15 we used to offer, and we even had a hard time choosing which looks to release since we had about 30 that we really liked.”

Silk could be found in loose-fitting pants with geometric prints for both men and women. Denim popped up here and there and so did leather, which was used for jackets as well as for a stunning pair of caramel pants.

Mahéo kept his signature Parisian chic style for this collection, but it served as an opportunity to appeal to a wider audience with silhouettes that could soon be seen in the Hamptons or on the Californian coast. Officine Générale is preparing to open seven new stores with the support of American investment firm, The Untitled Group. ""Since the opening of our store in New York, business is exceeding our expectations in the United States,"" explained the CEO. ""We are opening two new stores in Los Angeles and a second store in New York. We are also going to open stores in France, in Aix-en-Provence and Lyon, and will dedicate a new store in the 9th arrondissement of Paris to our Daily Classics line. Things are coming along very well.”

Despite not wishing to celebrate its 10th anniversary, Officine Générale commemorates it nonetheless by presenting this magnificent collection.Paul Smith: Work and leisure 
Paul Smith managed to conjure up the 80’s without an ounce of nostalgia in the outcome. The British designer crafted a lightweight suit with love, worn by men that appeared to be going to the beach. ""It's encouraging to see people go back to tailoring, but in lighter, more wearable weights,"" said Sir Paul backstage as he stood in front of photographs from the fashion show.

Staged inside a condemned post office in the 11th arrondissement, the collection featured numerous zippers, many of which were finished with artistic references - from floaty coats and gorgeous trenches, to a perfectly cut suit with a air-brushed rust effect finish. The show started and ended with sweaters printed with a variety of colors that were Mark Rothko-worthy.
 
The pieces were all rendered in a contemporary color palette that included lavender, pale grey, pistachio and an impressive dull navy blue and were paired with beautiful jungle print coats and dress shirts.
 
""Liquid fabrics wrapped around the torso, and '80s references like wide lapels and notched low collars,"" enthused Sir Paul, who was inspired by gallery visits and '80s art installations.

""A day in an art gallery, in clothing you can actually wear. I'm quite happy with this collection,"" he smiled, before suddenly handing a pair of socks to critic Luke Leitch and letting out a loud laugh.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 28, 2022","The White House Historical Association announced on Monday a new virtual fashion exhibit highlighting overlooked designers and seamstresses for first ladies. Dubbed 'Glamour and Innovation: The Women Behind the Seams of Fashion at the White House', the exhibit will cover more than a hundred years in fashion history, through a mix of archival photography, portraits, biographies, and press clippings. 

It explores the work of seamstresses, designers, and couturiers responsible for iconic first ladies' fashions including eight entrepreneurial women who forged ahead despite racial discrimination. It begins with Elizabeth Keckley, Mary Lincoln's dressmaker who was born enslaved, through to Mary Matise, who designed Rosalynn Carter's 1977 inaugural gown.The exhibit also explores how American designs could rival Parisian fashion, and how they were designed across the aisle for first ladies of both parties.

The exhibit is the result of an inaugural academic partnership with NYU, which began in January and will continue in 2023, with the next fellow chosen this fall through a competitive application process.

It was envisioned, researched and built by the Association's first Digital Exhibit fellow, MA/MS Costume Studies student Maegan Jenkins, in collaboration with the Association's David M. Rubenstein National Center for White House History's Digital Library team.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 27, 2022","For her eponymous label’s sixth anniversary, Marine Serre set out to impress by staging the Olympic Games of upcycled fashion. And she pulled it off! On Saturday evening, the French designer, aged 30, orchestrated a joyful, spectacular show at the stadium of the Lycée Michelet in Vanves, in a vast park in the south-western suburbs of Paris, presenting a collection with a strong sportswear vibe.
 Once inside the stadium, guests were welcomed by ‘volunteers’ sporting the label's ‘State of Soul’ t-shirts - from the show’s title - with an Olympic logo developed for the occasion by Marine Serre. Like a speaker at an Olympics opening ceremony, Serre herself kicked off the festivities, starting the parade of athletes/models, led by a giant flag made of a patchwork of wind-blown scarves carried all along the blue athletics track. A sure sign of fate, a ray of sunshine pierced the heavy grey clouds that had been gathering ominously until then.
 
Swimmers opened the pageant, clad in swimming costumes made of recycled fibres. The same material cropped up later in a series of skin-tight black bodysuits and jumpsuits decorated with Marine Serre’s signature inverted half-moon, or patterned with golden baroque jewellery prints. They were followed among others by tennis players, weightlifters and footballers, led by former Liverpool striker Djibril Cissé, a Frenchman. “I love sport, it's part of my past. I practised a lot of sport as a teenager. In fact, I have always designed sportswear, since the very beginning, but I’ve never shown it,” said Serre backstage.The collection, as always with Marine Serre, puts a strong emphasis on clothes made from recycled materials. White cotton embroidered pillowcases turn into shirts, shorts and skirts, matched with coats, jackets and dresses assembled from different types of denim. Oversize scarves morph into flowing dresses. A maxi coat is covered with a deluge of appliqué pockets, from the shoulders to the bottom hem. Light-coloured leather triangles are cleverly fitted together to make jigsaw trousers and blousons, while lace doilies are elegantly inserted into crocheted knitwear.
 
For next summer, anticipating future heatwaves, Serre has used terry fabric extensively to fashion snug trouser sets, tight-fitting playsuits and assorted bathrobe-style coats. In a more sophisticated vein, she has also designed chic suits, tweed jackets with golden buttons, outfits with a tonal tapestry effect, and even she wrapped multiple gold chains around the neck, arms and waist of Lourdes Leon, Madonna’s daughter, who brought the show to a close.The collection exuded an air of great comfort and elegance, and was punctuated by sundry accessories. “For the first time, there are many types of accessories. It took me quite a while to develop them properly. They too are made using an upcycling approach,” said Serre, an advocate of organic growth. Renowned for her futuristic couture sportswear and her penchant for upcycled fashion, in six years she has become one of the hottest names in the world of fashion. Her company currently employs about 70 people, and has recently hired its first head of operations.
 
Marine Serre premièred in 2016 with women’s ready-to-wear, and gradually added menswear looks, which are now playing an increasingly significant role in the label's range. Hence the decision to schedule a show for the first time during the Parisian menswear calendar. “This year, menswear sales have increased by more than 30%. I realised that upcycling is rare in menswear, but men’s clothes lend themselves well to this practice, because their shapes are less complex,” said Serre.
 
She was radiantly happy, still struggling to realise how popular she is. To sign off the show, Serre staged a big party, inviting a thousand people from her community via Instagram. “Fashion has to open up to ordinary people. The public was so happy to be able to attend this show. We felt real togetherness. For me, that’s the most important thing,” she concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 27, 2022","After arriving in the United States at a young age as a refugee from Somalia, Mohamed Malim has gone on to found a fashion label called Epimonia that's shattering negative stereotypes about refugees while supporting them in various ways. Based in Minnesota, the start-up collects life jackets worn by refugees and transforms them into ready-to-wear pieces, accessories and jewelry.Mohamed Malim is sending out a strong signal with his fashion label Epimonia, which means 'perseverance' in Greek, created to shine a spotlight on the millions of refugees around the world who have been forced to flee their countries. Beyond the financial and emotional support provided, the label's vocation is to raise awareness about the plight of these exiled people, and above all, to share inspiring stories of success rather than perpetuate clichés. The clothes and accessories offered by Epimonia are crafted by seamstresses who have themselves fled their countries.

A success storyMohamed Malim is himself a former refugee, born in a camp in Kenya, who came to the United States nearly two decades ago after fleeing the civil war in Somalia. Now founder and creative director of the Epimonia label, he launched his start-up to enable as many refugees as possible to receive the same support he and his family received when they arrived in the United States. And all by using the ultimate symbol of the often perilous flight to a foreign land, the life jacket.

Epimonia collects the life jackets worn by refugees as they cross the Mediterranean to the island of Lesbos, Greece, where they are then left abandoned on the beach. These life jackets are then transformed into hoodies, T-shirts, parkas, denim jackets, tote bags, hats and bracelets. Each piece in the collection features an orange rectangle evoking these life jackets, with or without an accompanying message. ""Refugees Welcome,"" ""Refugees United"" or ""Citizens of the World, We are Refugees,"" are slogans featured on some of the brand's clothing items.

Cleaning up beaches, supporting refugees

With this initiative, Epimonia is working to clean the beaches of thousands of discarded life jackets, helping to protect the planet, while supporting refugees in their quest for a better life. The goal is to help them with employment and housing, as well as scholarships and citizenship applications.

""We are driven to break down negative stereotypes of refugees often seen in the media. We use our platform to collaborate and partner with refugee organizations, sports teams, artists, and more to share inspiring refugee stories. Our goal is to create awareness and elevate the global refugee community,"" reads the brand's official website.

Through its EpimoniaLab, which aims to find new ways to recycle life jackets, the label has already partnered with a number of organizations and personalities, including the Minnesota United FC soccer club or the artist, Denimani.

By the end of 2021, nearly 90 million people had been forcibly displaced around the world, including more than 27 million refugees, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Among them, more than half are under 18 years old. This situation has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The international organization now estimates that four million people could eventually flee the country.

Since 2018, Epimonia has recycled more than 500 life jackets, allowing it to give $45,000 to refugees in the form of donations.

"Jun 27, 2022","Menswear’s two most defiantly artistic designers – Craig Green and Jonathan Anderson – began Saturday with two strikingly unique visions in Paris, before the venerable French house of Hermès presented a salutary lesson in nonchalant chic.
 Craig Green: 'Decorated Man' in the Musée de l’Homme 
The inspiration was 'Decorated Man'; the location was the Musée de l’Homme; and the result was the show and collection of the season by Craig Green. 
Masterminding disparate elements from WW2 watch dust covers, workerist garments and comics to Wedgwood pottery, Green presented a brilliant contemplation of men’s fashion, whose influence will extend across all continents.
 
All the way from his opening trio of all-white looks: with surgeon's smock and wide pants; accessorized by Sam Browne belts; dust cover chokers and wristbands; water bottles; face blinkers and the first of many structural extensions – a motorbike seat built as a front harness. Subsequently, playing in similar elements in a gentle beige, in a collection with a perfect color palette – of anthracite, faded gold, gray-blue denim and rosy rose.Throughout, a sense of nomads gathering ideas as they traversed the planet. From silvery padded backpacks, hang gliding harnesses or man-bags, to rose gold laptop covers, belts and trouser trim. Often with the silver patches functional – actual bags in which you could wrap up the garment.
 
Craig also returned to his signature statement, billowing tents, extended off the shoulders of several models, who stood out graphically inside the Paris museum, covered in all-white plastic for the show. 
 
Haute conceptual fashion, but based on great waxy cotton jackets; matte silver dusters, padded blazers and ergonomic pants. No wonder the front row was packed with the best retailers in the industry.
 
Green’s initial inspiration, the Decorated Man, whose concept is the body as art.
 
“We were trying to make a very useful man, so we added a saddle and a ladder. And conceptual objects – cans you cannot drink from, or suitcases you cannot get into,” he laughed in the backstage.
 
A heraldic section of giant padded coats with garlands and coats of arms, was in turn inspired by the patterns and shapes from sports magazines, where one could pick one’s own shield for school. Before a finale with heraldic motif padded coats; tunic and cloaks, all playing on the idea of Wedgwood pottery
 
“It was like watching Antiques Roadshow in my youth, when the ultimate find was a Wedgwood pot!” added Green, who even included a new riskier vision of his oeuvre. Brilliant bio-morphic, cut-out tops in mixes of coated materials and Japanese knitted paper, paired with padded pants.
 
While the all white set suggested the idea of neo-classical pottery where the background is pure white and the symbols stand out more. 
 
Green also went into overdrive with his shoe collaboration with Adidas, the first season that the brand used the 'Boost' sole as a topside material.
 
“I don’t know if I am supposed to say this, but Boost was invented for cow-beds before being used on trainers,” smiled Green, who also showed completely flat pack sandals; and packable and ‘zippable’ shoes trimmed, well, in zips.
 
It was hard to think of any bum note in this collection, because there wasn’t one. To sum it, after 12 days of menswear and almost 100 shows, Green was the outstanding collection of the season.
 Loewe: Nature-meets-technology 

All about the meeting of art, social commentary, nature and cool clothes at Loewe, where another all-white décor for a remarkable sloping set. And a fairly radical switch of direction at Loewe, with plenty of active sports ideas – two-stripe leggings and tops – leavened into an arty concoction.  
Other brands – from Dior to Zegna – have referenced the great outdoors this past week. Loewe’s creative director sent living nature out onto the catwalk.
 
Working with a Spanish artist, who incorporates living plants onto fabrics. The result were sneakers that sprouted six-inch high blades of grass; or moss-covered pants and Crombies.
 
“It’s a little like when you are  young and discover you can grow watercress inside an eggshell,” smiled Anderson, explaining that Loewe planned to sell actual seeds with the footwear in flagship boutiques.
 
Many models wore live screen masks; others eased down the slope in cocoon coats covered with meter sized panels of screens. 
 
“It’s the idea that nature can be technology, or technology nature. And that if we experiment we might find different methods in fashion in order to progress,” he added.
 
All the screens featuring images from nature – like tropical fish or busy bees. All culled  from Internet photo library Shutter Stock. All making for great fashion theatre.
 
“We loved the idea that these photos were made by people and just uploaded,” Jonathan explained.  
 
A key element in Anderson’s revival of Loewe has been his use of Spanish leather, slightly rawer than Italian or French leather, yet with a more subtle hand. His runway was covered in the material; from the cocoon coats to the chunky boots, made in the shape of handbags, all the way to the drawstring closures.
 
“I know fashion is working with the metaverse, but maybe it needs to be more about physicality. A bit like Silicon Valley, an oasis of tech surrounded by an oasis of nature. Fashion needs to be a window onto the world. Especially in this moment, when we turn on the TV and we seem less progressive,” the Northern Irishman concluded.
  Hermès: Chic nonchalance 
Nonchalance, from the old French word meaning disregard, was the key to this latest Hermès collection. As a sense of levity and ease wafted through this show, despite being presented under a threatening sky.Clouds so dark, the house handed out rain-proof parkas and large umbrellas to all guests entering into the courtyard of the Manufacture des Gobelins, the city’s famed maker of tapestries. In the end, not a drop of rain fell, as the clothes suggested summer, sunny terraces; beachside cafes; Mediterranean sunsets.
 
“I wanted to leave the city behind. And I was seeing swimming pools; wavy patterns, distorted when seen through water; sparking colors,” smiled Véronique Nichanian, menswear designer of Hermès.
 
In a surprise move, Nichanian even sent out several mega Birkin bags for boys, made in wide-spaced checks to match shirts.
 
Practically not a suit in sight, but a series on great jerkins and wind cheaters made in nylon, fine cottons and second skin leather. Some completed with inlays that looked like mini tiles. Barely a suit in sight, but lots of cool clingy knits in sunset and rosy dawn hues. 
 
Most everything anchored on techy river-running sandals, as if in a hurry to make a pre-aperitif swim. Sounds like a good idea.

"Jun 27, 2022","Paris menswear witnessed two contrasting visions on Sunday: Thom Browne posh demi-cross dressing in wool bouclé, and Hedi Slimane’s retro rocker statement amid thousands of millennial teeny boppers.
 Celine: Banal clothes, feverish show 
One word we never thought we’d used about Hedi Slimane was banal, but that’s the adjective that came to mind watching his latest show for Celine.Not that the event was banal, just a lot of the collection. In fact, there was sense of palpable frenzy about the whole event, staged in the Palais de Tokyo, along the Seine. Beginning with the huge crowds – at least 3,000 fans – who cheered and screamed in rockers, influencers and, above all, K-pop band members.
 
When Lisa of Blackpink – the queen of K-pop and ambassador of Celine since 2020 – showed up, the crowd outside went into overdrive, overturning barriers, screeching her in. Having 78 million Instagram followers does suggest a certain popularity.Even Bernard Arnault - the richest man in Europe, whose LVMH luxury conglomerate owns Celine – got in on the act. BA trotted outside to record her arrival along pals BTS’s V and Park Bo-gum - on his mobile phone, as a small posse of security men and scores of Asian influencers followed in the multi billionaire’s wake.
 
When the Asian stars were finally took their seats, the paparazzi inside then went into such a frenzy they made piranhas look like Trappist monks.
 
Finally settled, the show kicked off strongly with smartly tailored blazers and tuxedos, doused in crystal and fringed with silver string and pearls, worn over shorts and Chelsea boots with huge soles. Worn by models, their hair dyed and waxed back like early Roxy Music covers. 
 
Hedi’s preferred footwear was a Cuban heel cowboy boot that will surely find followers. As has the brand. After perhaps initially struggling to make his mark at Celine, the brand has been gaining traction. LVMH do not break out Celine’s results, but judging from the cat like smiles on the face of Arnault, and the house’s CEO Severine Merle, Slimane is clearly hitting the numbers.
 
But not perhaps zapping the zeitgeist. For this was a weak collection by Hedi’s standards. From the Smarties hued sequined monkey suits or rather odd Stars and Stripes cable sweater there were a fair few clangers. Even Slimane’s famed tailoring was off it's A Game, with oversized jackets cut with shrunken sleeves.
 
And the sheer repetition of the soundtrack, written and performed by Gustaf – with the endlessly repeated phrase, “You know people do terrible things” – didn't help.
 
Nor did the fact that seconds after the end of the show – normally a moment, when the audience depart rapidly, an announcer insisted: “Ladies and gentleman please sit down you cannot leave.” And those who managed to escape the clutches of security guards and get out of the art space were greeted outside by such huge excited crowds, there was a disturbing Day of the Locust sensation.
 
All told, not a great show or outing from the designer so acclaimed as Slimane. The whole point about Hedi’s career is the skill with which one addresses popular culture and art using the median of fashion. This show, and collection, however, felt like a mere pale reflection of his great moments of previous seasons.  
 Thom BrowneIt’s amazing how much mileage you can get out of a gray flannel suit, especially if you are Thom Browne, who opened his shows with five little boy bankers. Before things went pretty crazy.   
 
The opening quintet appeared in the snuggest of jackets, shorts, wingtips and matching briefcases. Then a gang of icons, society beauties and grand dames arrived clutching invites in mock late arrivals for the show – from Marisa Berenson to Farida Khelfa. Feigning remorse and acting aghast that they could not find their seats.Eventually seated, the cast resumed their tour inside the Automobile Club in Place de la Concorde – in the key fabric of wool bouclé, the sort normally favored by Chanel, in peppermint, pink, lime and sea-blue, finished with metallic threads. Coco for cool cats.
 
All cut suavely into blazers, mini jackets, top coats and redingotes, albeit with plenty of kinky accessories. Men in bouclé bras; or bouclé jockstraps. The latter worn with bumster skirts and shorts, so one could see plenty of bottom.
 
Bouclé on loafers, belts, ties and even anchor shape miniature face jewelry and adornments, all the way to a kennel worth of bags in the shapes of dogs – Jack Russells, terriers, corgis or dachshunds. 
 
Faint cowboy references mingled together with posh Wasp codes, underlined by a country-and-western song on the soundtrack about bucking broncos.
 
In further fun moves, all the cast carried small signs with their numbers  - like in old couture shows – except completely out of order. 
 
All the way to the final look, with a bare bum bouclé wool cowboy. He had probably had never ridden further west than where Christopher Street meets the Hudson river, but did a great imitation of a barn dance, to the tune of Madonna’s Don’t Tell Me.
 
Talk about enormous applause, and after 12 days and some 100 shows the biggest cheer of the whole menswear season in Europe.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 25, 2022","Cool T.M. has been a hit since its launch, mixing couture, streetwear, and irony. At 38 years old, Thomas Monet is already a veteran in the overcrowded field of emerging French designer brands, but it’s without a doubt his more than 15 years of experience in the luxury industry that has allowed him to successfully launch his brand on the verge of the pandemic. From the start, Cool T.M. positioned itself as a playful, carefree and irreverent brand, quickly finding an audience and commercial success. Monet, the Burgundy-born designer and only French finalist in the running for this year’s Andam Prize, joined the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode’s Sphère showroom this season, which presents the most promising young designers on the Parisian scene. He unveiled a colorful Spring/Summer 2023 collection on Thursday in the unconventional setting of an ‘80s resort where kitsch vied with tackiness but of course continued to be very cool. 
 
Between clothes and accessories, such as a chain necklace or a distressed tweed bucket hat, the looks were all very appealing. Whether in the streetwear register with oversized sweaters or with plaid dark velvet maxi-suits embellished with rhinestones, or in the more couture category, with a yellow tweed mini-skirt set, printed silk lavaliere shirts or a sumptuous white suit featuring an oversized double-breasted jacket under which an impeccably cut wrap skirt slipped over the pants.Cool T.M. delivers a nonsensical mix, where genres clash with style. ""This brand is first and foremost about attitude, as its name suggests,"" said Monet, who said he wanted to bring ""lightness and benevolence"" to the somewhat pretentious world of fashion. ""I want to break down the barriers that limit us and put the human being back at the center. I want people to feel themselves, to dare. Dressing up should be fun,"" he added. 
""I make products that inspire me in a very instinctive way. I'm interested in people's personalities,"" continued the designer, who designs all his collections in France and produces them in France, Italy and Portugal. Positioned in the designer brand segment, Paris-based Cool T.M offers, among other things, T-shirts from €190 to €390, shirts at €450, tweed jackets at €1090 and embroidered jackets for €1190.
 
The brand, which launched in 2020, seduced about 25 multi-brand retailers in its first season, continued to grow during the pandemic, and now boasts around 40 clients including some of the best boutiques in the world, from Joyce to 10 Corso Como, and from Ssense to Farfetch.

Cool T.M.'s success was built on a solid track record. After studying at Esmod Bordeaux, Monet started working for Daniel Crémieux in menswear, then moved on to Balmain, where he worked with Christophe Decarnin followed by Olivier Rousteing, whom he had met at his fashion school. He then gave it all up and launched Cool T.M. as he ""wanted to express himself"". His brand is undoubtedly one to keep an eye on.Rains dreams up a futuristic and optimistic Club KidsRains, another brand already established in European multi-brand stores and department stores, is asserting its creative approach. After taking its first steps on the Parisian catwalks last winter, the brand (led by creative director Tanne Vinter) was eagerly awaited to present its first summer fashion show entitled ""Connect"".Founded in 2012, built around rainwear and down jackets, the Danish brand's potential for summer is yet to be explored. And this Thursday, in the morning heat of the huge industrial warehouse of 104, a cultural venue in the 19th arrondissement, a colorful army straight out of an urban and optimistic sci-fi universe strolled between the walls of speakers, referencing New York's Club Kids movement of the 1980s.

The brand opened the show with a first look taken from the familiar terrain of outerwear, with an ankle-length sand-colored parka with four large pockets worn with conviction over a black T-shirt and mid-rise pants, with which Rains' lineup ventured into new horizons. The boys wore wide knee-length shorts with wide superlight nylon windbreakers and long-sleeved or sleeveless fleece jackets paired with baggy pants.The color palette ranged from gold and silver to black, but mostly featured aqua green, electric blue and mimosa yellow. The girls wore XL jackets or oversized crop-top sweatshirts over mini shorts with black knee-high socks. Bags and accessories could be found everywhere and in all sizes, a sign that the brand wants to develop its full potential in this product category. Models wore ultra-light clogs and mules reminiscent of the pieces seen at Yeezy over the past few seasons.The iconic piece of this collection: a cap-cape available in different sizes. The short size resembled the silhouette of a male runner. The acqua-green mid-length version which reached down to the calves gave impetus to a young woman wearing a loose nylon windbreaker in the same color over a black bodysuit and large leggings that started above the knee. The show’s final look was a long metallic gray flowy cape that moved to the rhythm of the model’s steps.  ""After winter last season, we had to bring our brand's DNA to this summer collection. We worked with new, lightweight and breathable materials. It was a challenge, but we are very happy to be in Paris,"" explained Philip Lotko, co-founder of Rains alongside Daniel Brix Hesselager, after the fashion show. The brand has just gained a foothold in the French market and opened its showroom in the Marais district of Paris.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

 AmiAlexandre Mattiussi’s latest show for his burgeoning brand Ami was a hit from the opening look. Audrey Tautou opening in a cool trench before the Sacré Coeur of Montmartre, before an audience of Naomi Campbell and Carla Bruni.
 
Instant applause both from the guests and a couple of thousand fans at the bottom of the steps up to the famed church. The mere fact the city and local church agreed to let Ami stage its show in front of the legendary basilica, another indication of how much this contemporary Parisian brand Ami means in France. Cheers rippling through the audience as the likes of Liya Kebede – in khaki waistcoat and matching pants – Cara Delevingne – prancing like a saucy schoolgirl in leather biker jacket and unbuttoned shirt.
 
“A schoolgirl in Montmartre. French girls and French boys; romanticism, Paris, Paris, Paris!” enthused Alexandre, post show, before the giant panoramic view.
 
“My first apartment when I came to Paris was in Montmartre. Now I live in an apartment with a view of the Sacré Coeur. I see it every time when I go to bed. So, it’s my Coeur Sacré. And that’s the name of the collection,” beamed the bearded designer. 
Presenting a real mix of chic citizens, including racy ladies, who pair crisp green wool blazers with thigh-high boots; seduce in lipstick-red leather jackets, like “une pute de Pigalle,” the designer cackled, using the French term for a hooker.
 
All the way to the little black dress, in a cute reference to Edith Piaf. Before a privately educated Parisienne got raunchy in skinny sailor’s sweater, micro mini and thigh-highs, as she parties in this funky district.
 
Mattiussi will always love a big enveloping coat, this season in Tati gingham, an homage to the famed low-cost department store that once was the anchor fashion tenant of this north Paris neighborhood. Also showing great pink Tati-style one-button blazers and mini skirts as the bronze equestrian statues of Joan of Arc and Louis XIV looked down benignly. 
 
For guys, faded jeans and blazers, each finished with his new heart-shaped Ami-logo golden buttons. All blended together with Argyles, stripes and touristy shirts.  Nothing too revolutionary but a hyper focused collection that said, well, Paris, Paris, Paris.
 
Another indication of how hot this brand Ami boasts 15 stores in Japan. Pre-pandemic there were just three. 
 
Legend has it the Romans beheaded Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris, at this site. On Thursday, as the sun set, it felt like the city had just consecrated Mattiussi as its latest fashion saint.
 
 Amiri: Icy blue in the Jardin des Plantes 
Mike Amiri, a designer who has been causing quite a buzz in Los Angeles, greeted Paris in a show that elevated his California off-duty-movie-star look to a more sophisticated level.
 
During the pandemic, Mike produced a series of swish videos and shows – shot in iconic mid-century modern villas and in historic movie locations in LA. His sense of savvy showmanship was evident again in Paris, with a giant pristine logo runway, the third the size of a grid iron, built as a platform overlooking the historic Jardin des Plantes. While his demi-gothic logo reached twice as high as any of the lanky models.
 
What worked best was his great ice, blue, ecru and faded-cement palette, seen in all sorts of cool sportswear, beachwear and loungewear.
 
Amiri isn’t Giorgio Armani, but he is adept at cutting a soft-shoulder jacket, and he has a great eye for casual chic. Plus he can shape shorts like Brâncuși, whether in terry, toweling, cotton paisley or khaki cotton. Made voluminous; as skorts; combined with kilts; or finished like an intarsia ice field, they all looked great.
 
“He’s been really growing as a designer. It takes time to really make great fashion, but Mike is getting there,” commented Renzo Rosso, whose Only the Brave holding company owns a significant minority stake in Amiri.
 
All finished with white logo sneakers and accompanied by a soothing soundtrack of Shade and Kool & The Gang, this was an important victory for Mike Amiri. He had earned and won Paris’ respect. Not something handed out easily in fashion.

"Jun 23, 2022","The second day of Paris Fashion Week presented subtly renewed menswear on Wednesday. Brands played with proportions and volumes, seen with Lemaire and Hed Mayner. Lemaire, led by Christophe Lemaire and Sarah-Linh Tran, made clothes light as a feather with a delicate lineup, while Hed Mayner, founded by the eponymous designer, played with volumes.
 At the Lemaire show, time was suspended as models seemed to be waiting for a ghostly train at a station. They mingled with the audience in the beautiful hall of the Musée des Arts et Métiers, complete with wooden windows and ceiling and mosaic floor and accompanied live by Californian singer and guitarist Ana Roxanne. The models walked through the space unnoticed, stopped to look out the window, or leaned against a wall to daydream, dive into a book, draw, or chat passionately with a group of friends. Lovers held hands in a corner while an exhausted traveler fell asleep on a bench. 
 
Designers Lemaire and Tran were inspired by romantic and nostalgic poetry to revisit their key pieces such as trench coats, pleated pants and loose-fitting shirts. The garments were light, never bulky, delicately enveloping the wearers, with silk/nylon or viscose dresses that looked great when wrinkled. Suits in silk mixed with metallic thread held the fabric’s pleats.""We tried to make the garment as light as possible. To reinforce this feeling, we worked a lot on the idea of parachute with light cotton clothing"", said Tran. The poplin or seersucker garments expanded or, on the contrary, contracted, through ribbons of the same fabric knotted at the waist or ankles. Another of this season’s novelties were cotton pajama sets featuring fine stripes with long tunics paired with pants that look like sleeves, ending at the foot with classic shirt cuffs.
  
The monochromatic looks were rendered in a natural color palette, as if sun-kissed, and offered bursts of freshness with baby pinks and sky blues. Tropical flowers appeared on certain pieces, as well as raw art drawings by Noviadi Angkasapura, an artist from New Guinea. 
The same minimalist spirit reappeared in natural tones at Hed Mayner, but in a completely opposite register, whether in thicker, more solid textures or oversized volumes. As always, the Israeli designer draws his inspiration from the world of workwear to create a protective and functional unisex wardrobe, replete with oversized pockets. This time around, he explored new constructions that left garments completely backless. 
 
Trench coats were completely open at the back and tied with a ribbon, like an apron, while a chunky knit sweater appeared normal from the front but was open from the back. T-shirts also revealed the lower back area. Even classic blazers were simply hanging from the neck by the collar, while sleeves dropped down to leave shoulders exposed.
 
Hed Mayner also gave pride of place to upcycling. The designer found old-fashion linens in the markets of Tel Aviv and in Parisian retailers. He cut out sheets, tablecloths and other fabrics in embroidered linen and white cotton and inserted them into his pieces to create breezy garments with a vintage flavor. An embroidered pillowcase became a beautiful square top, and doilies were delicately placed on shoulders or bordering shorts, shirts, pants and tunics, like slips and petticoats.
 
As for the rest of the collection, bomber jackets and extra wide pants played with volumes and shapes, such as a denim jacket-pant set and a military anorak worn with zouave pants.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 23, 2022","Loro Piana has announced the winners of the sixth edition of its international Knit Design Award competition. The contest is dedicated to talented students” who give their own creative interpretation of yarns “that represent the excellence” of the house. It sees a number of prestigious design schools taking part and the theme of the 2022 edition was Rediscovery. The winners were students Po-Chieh Chiu and Shanon Poupard from the Institut Français de la Mode, Paris.

As well as the award, they receive an employment contract with the company (the first time in the prize’s history that it has offered this). They will also have the opportunity to create the finished garment in the firm’s knitwear workshop. And the project will be shown during Pitti Filati later this month.Also taking part were students from North Carolina State University, Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, the Politecnico di Milano, Tel Aviv’s Shenkar College and Tokyo’s Bunka Fashion College.

They were asked to reinterpret the brand’s Traveller Jacket and “create a personal, knitwear version, delving into tradition and future, tailoring and experimentation”. 

The final took place this week during a special event at the firm’s new Milan HQ. The judges included the company’s CEO Damien Bertrand, Sara Sozzani Maino of Vogue Italia, founder of Stylenotcom Beka Gvishiani, knitwear designer Chet Lo, and Letizia Schätzinger who’s a TikToker and content creator.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 22, 2022","On a steamy Wednesday in Paris, Givenchy went full logomania, after rising star Bianca Saunders opened the day with a pioneering collection of sculptural street tailoring.
 
 Givenchy: Logo overload 
Logo overload at Givenchy, though why not, since this led Matthew Williams to produce his most powerful fashion statement for the Paris house.
 
It also felt that these clothes were why they hired Williams in the first place - to update the codes of the house. Though very much the codes laid down by Riccardo Tisci rather than any of the six other successors to founder Hubert de Givenchy.To be fair, Williams was handed the reins just as the pandemic struck, and his ability to harness the avant-garde street style with which he built his reputation at his own house, 1017 ALYX 9SM, has been limited.
 
Which is what made this such a good show, where models marched through a pond of what looked like fat-free milk, at the center of which was a large pristine white cube – their putative backstage. All set within the confines of the Ecole Militaire, patrolled by grumpy camouflaged troops with machine guns, looking, quite frankly, faintly comical. Almost extras from Toy Story, as they surveyed the coiffed audience of some 800 editors, buyers and VIPs. 
 
In a busy moment, Matthew showed a powerful 1017 ALYX 9SM collection with great panache at an abandoned Olympic sized swimming pool in Milan last Friday.
 
Back in Paris, Williams' biggest idea for Givenchy was logomania, from the opening look – a padded ecru baseball jacket, embossed and printed with Givenchy; the brand’s rectangular four G's and '1952,' the year of the house’s founding. He paired the jacket with the first of many chopped-off rubber wellingtons, ideal for splashing about the three-inch-deep pond. 
 
After that, pretty much every look had a 'G' or a 'Givenchy'. Studded logos on the back of black hoodies in collegiate lettering; stamped across the rim of cashmere mujahidin beanies; prominent in white boxer shorts peering over jeans, Marky Mark-style; painted onto Day-Glo orange and lime sweatshirts.
 
“I love working with our logo, because Givenchy has such a beautiful logo that has not changed in 70 years. I love wearing it!” explained Williams in a post-show chat with fashion critics.
 
All told, an inner-city nomad look with plenty of punch and polish and active-sports references. Thanks to great zippered pants; techy parkas and cool nylon dusters.
 
“I think every look is grounded in reality. I can see pretty much every look existing on the street. For me that is a modern approach to fashion,” said the 36-year-old designer.
 
Finally, after experimenting with grander tailoring and couture references at Givenchy, Williams is doing, surely, what LVMH hired him to do. 
 
There have been rumblings of discontent from within LVMH, but this sure has Williams embarking on the right path at Givenchy. For how long only time will tell.
 
 Bianca Saunders: Sculptural sartorial street styleSculptural street style at Bianca Saunders, a UK designer who has created an impressive body of work after just five years.
 
Saunders' great gift is ennobling modest fabrics like denim and fine cotton with couture-worthy cutting, resulting in something that is refined yet very hip.
 
Staged in a spare setting, with a nylon mesh caban backdrop, the collection contained some very clever cutting and tailoring. From superb trapezium denim jeans, cut with the cleverest of panels, to a series of natty jackets. These were made mega-rouched at the nape of the neck; cut with high regal collars and a scalloped back and finished at the front with curvy patch pockets. They all looked great, as did some arty great coats in frayed mercerized cotton and an open salvo of silk pajama looks made in blood orange or copper.“I wanted something light that also looked very strong,” quietly explained Saunders of her tailoring, as she greeted fans backstage inside a show space within Comme des Garçons Marais art center.
 
Since launching her brand in 2017, Saunders has been named a One To Watch by the British Fashion Council, before winning the Andam Grand Prix award in 2021.
 
To sum up, Saunders is very much a designer of the moment, creating personal and propelling fashion ideas.

"Jun 21, 2022","Ahead of the eagerly awaited women's ready-to-wear show in September, Filippo Grazioli has provided a glimpse of the direction he intends to steer Missoni in. At Milan Fashion Week Men, the long-established Italian label's new creative director has presented his first collection, dedicated to menswear, showing how he is softly, subtly transforming Missoni.
 Grazioli’s appointment was announced in March, but he had joined the label, well-known for its knitwear and the famous zigzag patterns, already a year ago, keen to have the time to immerse himself in Missoni’s history and archives, “with the whole staff and the [Missoni] family’s support.” He was notably able to consult with Rosita Missoni, who founded the label with her husband Ottavio in 1953, and their daughter Angela, Missoni's current president, who took over from her parents in 1997 and was in charge of design until last year.
 
“I’m here to rekindle the flame and help this label, with its powerful codes, transition into the 2020s. You have to have a huge amount of respect, for what Missoni is for a start, and for the materials you need to sublimate. We have fabrics and designs, but not really a Missoni silhouette, and I’ll be focusing mostly on this,” Grazioli told FashionNetwork.com, speaking at the collection’s presentation in the label’s via Solferino showroom in Milan.Grazioli wants to work on a style that is “rather relaxed, urban, easy, generous and comfortable,” the idea being to “engage with men’s daily lives, infusing the entire wardrobe with the comfort and lightness of knitwear.” For this first menswear collection, Grazioli drew his inspiration from founder Ottavio Missoni and his famous cardigans, focusing on the label’s signature knitted fabrics produced at Missoni’s own atelier in Sumirago, north of Milan, using the Raschel machines that have been crucial for Missoni’s success.
 
The Spring/Summer 2023 collection features Missoni’s classic, colourful striped patterns in sweaters matched with jersey darted trousers pleated at the waist. The zigzag patterns are often barely visible, embossed tone-on-tone in a white ensemble, as a mere detail at the back of a pair of white sneakers, or on the pocket, collar and cuffs of a shirt. Sometimes the patterns are magnified in a fresh twist, elsewhere they mix and match in different sizes. 
Grazioli prefers total looks and monochrome sets that put the accent on textures. His style is quite understated, mostly featuring primary colours like white, black, yellow, red and blue. Knitted tops are sometimes trimmed with stripes typical of varsity jackets, or styled in more of a chic French Riviera mood. The wardrobe is completed by a sportswear capsule collection designed in collaboration with Davide Tognetti.
 
A graduate of Milan's Istituto Europeo di Design in 2003, Grazioli, 41, started his career with an internship at Staff International, the production arm of Italian fashion group OTB, where he met Martin Margiela, with whom he worked until 2013. “That was a very fine experience, it was marvellous,” he reminisced. After a stint at Hermès with Christophe Lemaire, in 2015 he joined Givenchy, working with Creative Director Riccardo Tisci, whom he then followed at Burberry, returning to Milan in 2021, after spending 18 years in Paris.
 
“I sought to create a spontaneous, timeless aesthetic, talking about Missoni through the details,” he said. According to Grazioli, the goal is to “lead Missoni into the future by injecting it with a more luxurious feel, and heightening its quality in terms of details.”
 
As part of this repositioning effort, the prices of some product categories have been raised. Grazioli has also designed a capsule collection of high-end cardigans, made with patchwork fabrics or knitted using special stitching, priced between €1,200 and €1,490, while tops are priced at around €1,000 and trousers between €600 and €790.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 21, 2022","The Milan menswear season finished Monday night with a path-breaking, sprightly and jaunty Zegna collection unveiled before a giant vista of the Italian Alps, in a season marked by a longing for a return to this country’s roots.
 
A season of earthy shades – terracotta, wheat, corn gold or daffodil – nowhere more so than at Zegna, where creative director Alessandro Sartori sent his models out on the roof of Zegna’s historic textile plant. A red-brick chimney sprouting “non-hazardous” steam just seconds after sunset in the foothills of the verdant Alps, as the first of the cast appeared. 
Post-show, the evening led to a happy few dinner, hosted by Anna Zegna, granddaughter of founder Ermenegildo Zegna. Born in 1892, Ermenegildo must rank as one of European fashion’s greatest entrepreneurs. Opening a small textile maker and building it into the most important source of quality fabrics in Italian menswear. And, with his left hand, creating an eco-friendly forest garden, 'Oasi', long before the word ecology was inventive. As well as buying and stewarding a whole mountain side in Piedmont’s Alps.
 
“When I used to come into this room as a little girl, we were told to be very quiet for our grandfather. But we are very happy for you to make plenty of noise tonight,” smiled Anna, in a gentle discourse before a huge oil painting of Ermenegildo in a three-piece suit, as some 50 guests dined within the marble splendor of grandfather’s neo-classical villa.The founder’s suit a far cry from what we saw in this weekend’s Milan runways. It’s been a season where multiple men’s tailors have grappled with the questions: will many men ever wear suits again? How do you dress to be taken seriously in zoom, boardroom or after-hours?
 
No one has addressed the conundrum quite as directly as Sartori. And with the most élan of any of his colleagues, his whole raison d’etre these past few seasons has been developing post-pandemic style.
 
“It’s about new creating hybrid functions,” explained Sartori, citing as an example in a pre-show preview volume pants paired with terry cotton oversized Mao jackets. 
 
His bravest ideas were menswear couture-worthy fabrics – like double-face knitwear, with inside flat stitched cotton and outside terry. Or ensembles of over-sized shirt and outerwear finished with leather trim. 
One of Italy’s best tailors, Alessandro’s big statement was a single-breasted, single button tailor-made jacket with raw edges. Made in mohair, silk or three-ply linen.
 
“It’s the new interpretation of tailoring,” insisted Sartori.
 
Other must-haves included silk technical poplin wrinkle-free raincoats, so light they could fold inside the pocket of your jeans. Prints referenced the hills above Zegna's hometown of Trivero, with forest prints in ecru ultra-light linen jackets. Or tie-dyed knit jackets finished with a membrane to impact an eco-futurist feel. Real collectors’ items.
 
But, like all paradigm shifts this felt very much like a work in progress. With many oversized looks intriguing rather than flattering. Indeed, one felt nostalgic for the razor-sharp tailoring which made Alessandro’s name.
 
Guests were guided through the factory to the rooftop show, via an elevated gallery to the very noisy sound of machines churning out fabric. This turned out to be a tape of the plant since all the workers had gone for the night. But ended up sounding like a sleepy DJ on Quaaludes in an East German techno club.
 
And, oddly, despite being 700 meters above sea level, mosquitos went into overdrive devouring the privileged guests. And somehow tickling one’s conscience on how good this collection really was?Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 21, 2022","Sexy women's underwear didn't fare too well during the jogging-bottoms-and-pyjamas phase of the pandemic, but from the red carpet to lingerie shows, ultra-sultry intimate apparel is making a comeback -- and is now much more visible.

Rihanna helped set the mood with her radical approach to pregnancy fashion -- sporting a transparent babydoll dress over a black thong at the Dior show in Paris this winter.Or there was Megan Fox's all-but-invisible Mugler dress over a white thong at last year's MTV Awards.

Having your undies on display has been tried by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and even fictional fashion icon Carrie Bradshaw on ""And Just Like That...""""It's a trend that we see a lot in pop culture. Rihanna, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian -- they've seized on these styles in a very extroverted way and with a real feminist dimension,"" Renaud Cambuzat, creative director for Chantelle, told AFP.

Lingerie brand Chantelle was previously associated with comfort above all, but it has joined the trend, launching a new Chantelle X line that prioritises sexiness.

That was the dominant vibe across this year's International Salon of Lingerie in Paris which concluded on Monday -- where many were embracing the new appetite for thongs and transparent designs.

Experts say there has been a shift, however, and that this trend emphasises women wearing lingerie for themselves rather than trying to impress others.

""We are witnessing the return of the scruffy sexuality of the 2000s -- styles that refer to the archetype of the objectified woman, but which no longer have the same meaning,"" said Benjamin Simmenauer, philosopher and professor at the French Institute of Fashion.

""It is no longer a question of being ordered to seduce, but of a feminist reappropriation of sexualised clothing,"" he added.

- Re-investing in sexy -

The return of sexy lingerie marks a course correction after several years of change in the lingerie business, Chantelle's Cambuzat said.

""Four or five years ago, we were in #MeToo, and there was a desire to move towards something seen as more respectful,"" said Cambuzat.

""The #MeToo fight is not completely won but the field has opened up. There are women and brands that have found legitimate ways to reinvest in ultra-sexy styles.""

The change is evident in the way the big brands have embraced greater diversity in their models and advertising.

Victoria's Secret -- which was seen as symbolising a narrow beauty ideal in the past -- has abandoned its slogan ""The Perfect Body"" and its army of ""Angels"" in favour of more full-figured models and strong personalities such as footballer Megan Rapinoe.

""We must not confuse #MeToo and puritanism. A woman can also wish to seduce out of her own conviction,"" added Samar Vignals, of French lingerie brand Aubade, which has asserted the need for ""more audacity"" in the post-pandemic moment.

The company, previously known for its monochrome close-ups on bums and breasts, is now running ads that show faces, sometimes staring straight into the lens.

Aline Tran, founder of the erotic lingerie boutique Les Rituelles, said there needs to be less anxiety around seduction, and it should instead be seen as something empowering.

""We talk a lot more about acceptance of our bodies,"" she told AFP. ""Seduction is a great feminist asset. It allows us to regain control over our body and by extension over our mind.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Jun 21, 2022","Milan has become the most powerful magnet for young talent and millennium dreamers in Europe, and the clothes in the Italian menswear season reflected that new found belief and boldness.
 
In a word, the Milan menswear season was the most bustling and brilliant in the past decade. We caught up with six diverse brands that all heralded something new and unexpected.
 Tod’s: An earthy new sensibility 
Walter Chiapponi’s latest collection for Tod’s felt almost as if it had sprung from the earth of Italy with its hues of terracotta, sand and soil.
 
A sense heightened by a video projection at Tod’s presentation this weekend, which featured a gang of handsome youth shot as they wandered around a rural corner of the Apennines, finally gathering within a giant rust-colored cylinder.“It’s not a narrative, but more a sentiment of hope. A collection with a younger silhouette, freed more from the body. Where the video represents the idea of a personal moment lived together,” explained Walter before a board of his multiple looks.
 
Presented, as is the tradition for Tod’s, in the garden of Villa Necchi, a masterly modernist mansion in central Milan, where there were plenty of new takes on the brand’s signature codes.Parkas and wind-cheaters composed with leather inlays; a great petrol blue workerist cotton jacket; trench-coats constructed in rubberized cotton; and biker jacket and parkas jazzed up with rubber studs. 
 
In among them, a new take on the house’s iconic Gommino entitled the 'Bubble', a softer shaped evolution of the moccasin finished with a metal T Timeless buckle and a contrasting studs on the sole in bright summery colors.
 
Softer tote bags and backpacks in sporty ethnic fabrics looked just right for a fun weekend getaway. Everything looking very Italian, and managed to inject a neat dosage of easy modernism into practical clothes.
 Marcelo Burlon: Tenth anniversary, newfound respect 
Fashion likes few things more than a good anniversary and the great and the good gathered Saturday evening to fete Marcelo Burlon, whose brand County of Milan celebrated its tenth anniversary.Originally a DJ, Marcelo has always loved a large space to stage his shows, and few could be bigger than his latest location, the Velodromo Vigorelli, a giant cycling track. A space so large it contained an American football field within it. No wonder the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Clash were able to play there. 
 
County of Milan will always be about clubbing with a twist. And Burlon’s Spring 2023 ideas had plenty of the latter – from the broken-pattern check judo suits in faded pink and white hoodies covered with graphic sketches of rib cages, to patchwork light wool sweaters in sorbet hues cut off to expose acres of tummy and three-piece fantasy paisley suits made with Nehru jackets.
 
There was a time when crueler critics were mean to Marcelo for being a DJ far more than a designer. But this weekend, many of them should eat their words. This was a fine collection with a fresh vision that fully merited the huge cheer it earned Burlon at its finale.
 Doucal’s: Luxurious flexibility 
One brand very much on the move is Doucal’s, which opened a spanking new showroom in one of Milan’s finest buildings on Saturday, and revealed some great new men’s shoes.
 
Located at 5 via Gesù, in Palazzo Bagatti Valsecchi, with windows looking down on Milan’s most famous hotel, the Four Seasons, and on the Versace family home.
 
At the top-end of the product range, perfectly made loafers composed of Louisiana alligator in hues of steely blue and flint blue. Presented under a painted wooden ceiling of Renaissance nobility, the sort one only ever sees in Italy. 
 
Another great thing about Doucal’s is how it also manages to link uber high-end gents shoes, with elements of skateboarding. Close by, one finds a cool series of sneakers, in soft muted hues of mustard and putty. With soft interiors making them ideal for skating or just leisurely strolls.
 
“And you can do this with them,” smiled Gianni Giannini, creative director and CEO, as well as son of founder Mario Giannini, as he twisted the skater sneakers almost into a knot.
 
Similar flexibility was evident in burnished intreccio leather loafers and shoes; or smart, light-weight suede monks.
 
Looking ahead, Doucal’s, a family-owned brand based in Le Marche, Italy’s key footwear region, is predicting strong double-digit growth this year, from its annual turnover of 20 million euros.
 
“Our future is looking very rosy,” beams Giannini, dressed in a perfectly cut ecru whip-chord Lardini suit anchored by a pair of Doucal’s alligator loafers.
 Woolrich: Embracing the great outdoors 
Woolrich is a venerable American brand, that’s been revived by Italians based in Bologna; and now guided creatively in menswear by a Dutchman, but it’s heart will always be in the great outdoors, though in the finest of new materials.“It’s about elevating the product, making it lighter and a little more fun but always real,” explained creative director Mark van Beek in a tour spring 2023.
 
A meeting of noble fabrics – Tuscan-made plaids or super 100 fine wool – with technical-like linens and cottons supported by fine membranes. All mirroring the mood-board, which featured photos of the Woolrich Lodge, located at Zavikon Island, on a river border of America and Canada, just east of Lake Ontario. One T-Shirt featured the old world lakeside speedboats that ferry you to the lodge.
 
That frontier spirit given a fresh twist by subtly faded sweatshirts, pants and tops in jersey. Or in a great series of matelassé iconic check shirt/jackets that were cool and hyper practical. Multiple looks that can be worn in an urban context of out on a trail like the Pennsylvania Walk, the state where Woolrich was born.
 
Finished with a new minimalist sheep model, this was a clever expression of an iconic brand retooling for the global consumer, while keeping its American roots.
 Villa Eugenie: Coolest cocktail in town 
Milan’s coolest cocktail party was to celebrate the opening of the Milan office of Villa Eugenie, the highly respected production company helmed by Etienne Russo, which produces shows of the caliber or Dior Homme and Dries Van Noten. 
A gaggle of designers and men and ladies about town  - Alessandro Dell’Acqua, Giorgio Guidotti and Anna dello Russo – showed up to imbibe bio-wine and strong cocktails like a gin bash.
 
“It’s an important year for Villa Eugenie, our 30th anniversary. So, it feels right to open a new office in Milan. I feel there is a great new wave of creativity here now which is so inspiring. Milan is bubbling at the moment,” enthused Russo, a Belgian of Italian origin.
 
Located inside a storied south Milan palazzo, artfully restored to leave its faintly decayed frescoes and moldings contrasted with mid-century Italian furniture and works of conceptual art.
 
While there are occasional debates about Etienne’s choice of footwear, one can only admire his ability to blend haute-gamme sophisticated with cool and quirkiness. Meaning, if any of the events he produces in Italy look as good as his Milan office, his clients should be very happy.
 Luca LarenzaItaly will always be a unique source when it comes to knitwear, and one brand developing some great new ideas in this sector is Luca Larenza.In a charming piece of staging, Luca had eight handsome young guys pose at a café on via Lecco, located in the most happening multi-cultural corner of bustling Milan, the four blocks north of the Giardini Pubblici.
 
Showing blends of silk, linen and cotton to create super airy, semi-transparent striped soft collar polo shirts; striped tops and tanks. He paired these with wide, full pants in hemp and linen with big deep side patch pockets; contrast by shorts with tiny patch pockets.
 
“The key for me is lightness and optimism. We have to be positive about the future,” smiled Larenza, a Neapolitan who founded his brand in Milan. He now sells on the giant e-tailer Zalando, and next week will be in Paris showing in a Marais showroom.
 Moorer: Lake-side cool 
Italy is all about its regions, and their considerable diversity – well expressed by Moorer, a brand born on the shores of crystal clear Lake Garda, just north of Verona.
 
A lakeside marque with a very particular take on outerwear, seen in its latest collection presented in Milan this weekend.
 
Their big idea was fusing practical and stylish weekend clothes with fine and novel materials. Case in point, a great series of goose down jackets made of Japanese denim wade with contrasting bright nylon panels. Many finished with interior lining featuring images of elegant speedboats and villages on the giant Alpine lake.
 
Italians referencing their own little environment, even as they think globally – the leitmotif of this season.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 21, 2022","After a great turnout at Pitti Uomo in Florence and Milan Fashion Week, Paris is getting ready to fill up as well. Men's Fashion Week returns to the French capital from Tuesday, June 21 to June 26 with a very nice lineup. In addition to the already dense official program, there will be multiple off-calendar fashion shows, parties and special events, serving as an opportunity for brands to express themselves fully on the catwalks once again.
 From the AZ Factory and Highsnobiety pop-ups, to the DRP Drop Culture Festival, the Tranoi fair, boutique openings or the launch of capsule collections such as Karl Lagerfeld's with Alled-Martinez, the fashion world has had plenty of opportunities to celebrate the return to normality after two years of pandemic. One other highlight will be Marine Serre's show on Saturday evening, June 25, which will position itself on the men's calendar for the first time with a co-ed show and celebrate its fifth anniversary with a big open-air party - which will also be open to the public by reservation - at a still secret location.
 
This season, more than 80 fashion houses are on the official calendar, which includes 44 shows, of which only four will be held in digital format - those of Asian labels Sean Suen, Yohji Yamamoto, Juun.J and Sankuanz. There are also 40 presentations scheduled, including for the first time Chinese label Feng Chen Wang and French labels Fursac and Jeanne Friot, whose gender-neutral, eco-conscious brand will be in the Sphère showroom.Like Milan Fashion Week, the Paris week will continue to be broadcast online via the platform set up since the pandemic.

As for the fashion shows, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) announced no less than eight major brands returning. Starting with Celine, which will be closing the week on Sunday evening, June 26. Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, Craig Green, Givenchy, Junya Watanabe Man Namacheko and Thom Browne are also making their comeback; as is American Amiri, who after a hiatus in Los Angeles in January, will hold his first show in the official Paris calendar, where he has already presented his collections in the past.   
 
Other designers will also be returning to a physical format, such as Walter Van Beirendonck. In addition, the collections of two other newcomers will be on display, who in recent years had already attracted attention outside the calendar or in the official presentation program: English designer of Bulgarian origin Kiko Kostadinov and Lazoschmidl, founded in 2014 by Swedish-German duo Josef Lazo and Andreas Schmidl.
 
Among those absent this season are Andrea Crews, Uniforme, Jil Sander, GmbH, Avellano, Henrik Vibskov, Sacaï, White Mountaineering and Wales Bonner, who just appeared in Florence as special guest of Pitti Uomo. However, other big names will undoubtedly light up the City of Lights, such as Louis Vuitton on Thursday, whose collection was designed by the studio since LVMH has not yet appointed a successor to Virgil Abloh; Dior Homme on Friday; Hermès on Saturday, and Kenzo on Sunday.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 20, 2022","Moschino's return to the men's calendar in Milan did not go unnoticed on Sunday. As per usual, creative director Jeremy Scott staged a bold and colorful runway show, drawing on the fashion images and illustrations that have forged his fashion culture.
 All the right ingredients for a fantastic lineup were present: bright colors, art, trompe-l'oeil, Latin-Hispanic style, military influences, and a dash of S&M. These elements have been featured in different menswear collections designed by Scott for Moschino, the Italian Aeffe-owned brand, and can now be found coming together this season in one single collection.

The common thread? The famous illustrator and fashion photographer of the 1980s, Tony Viramontes. The Mexican-American artists, who died of AIDS at the age of 31 in 1998, created an imaginary world with his images featured in magazines such as The Face that have inspired many designers as well as Japanese artists. Scott was able to draw from the artist’s archives to reproduce several of his drawings on clothing. Abstract paint strokes, sketched portraits, patterns and graffiti were seen in technicolor on jackets, suits, T-shirts, sweatshirts, and jackets. Scott smeared big pink brushstrokes on black trench coats, shirts, black pants, as well as accessories: hats, bags, boots… You name it! Some looks reproduced the creases and folds of the fabric in trompe l’oeil. Others seemed to have been hastily scribbled with colored markers, with fluorescent strokes on chic blazers and biker looks. Several black ensembles sported squares scribbled in white chalk.    
For one look, Scott was inspired by the Buffalo movement of the '80s, promoted in the pages of The Face by photographer Jamie Morgan and fashion stylist Ray Petri. This style, revolutionary for its time, encouraged a new sexy, strong, and provocative anti-establishment attitude, in which men wore skirts or strutted around in boxers and Dr. Martens.
 
This is the spirit that permeated Moschino's new collection, in which models wore chunky boots or tall black leather boots and seville hats or military berets on their heads, at times adorning their look with large leather belts or long black glamorous vinyl gloves.

Pleated skirts were sometimes layered over pants. Coats, on the other hand, appeared to be split in two, like a leather jacket paired with a wrap skirt made in the same material, or a waterproof jacket worn with a mid-length skirt cut from the same camel fabric to form a trench coat.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 19, 2022","A breath of fresh air, particularly appreciated in the pesky Tuscan heat, blew Thursday at Pitti Uomo. Rwandan designer Moses Turahirwa held his first fashion show for his menswear brand Moshions in the picturesque setting of Villa Romana, a neoclassical villa nestled in the hills of Florence surrounded by a beautiful park. 
The designer welcomed his guests at the end of the afternoon in a joyful and casual atmosphere to unveil his Spring/Summer 2023 collection complete with African dancers and musicians.

His personal style mixed African references, notably through printed patterns, dyeing techniques like tie-dye, and draping - a real passion of Turahirwa - with Italian influences such as using ""sartorial"" cuts.Pants and tops were kept loose and flowy, wide black shorts were paired with short-sleeved classic white shirts, long tunic tops resembled boubous, and suits bore horizontal colored stripes. However, his approach to draping is what stood out the most, with silk shirts extending into scarves or shawls worn over one shoulder. Others seemed to float, rippled by delicate wave-like drapes. An impressive blazer that extends like a Roman toga or jacket-capes were also stand-out pieces. 
 
Born in Kigali, where he still lives and has set up his studio, 30-year-old Turahirwa originally went into engineering before pursuing his passion from a young age: fashion. He founded his brand in 2015 by drawing on native culture, such as embroidery, weaving and draping, using natural materials and dyes. 
Success did not take long to arrive. A couple of local celebrities started wearing his clothes and gave him visibility and he began to participate in different fashion weeks in Rwanda, Nigeria and South Africa.

In 2021, he will complete a master's degree at the Polimoda school in Florence, where he will explore Italian know-how.

""I found in Florence the same artisanal identity as in Africa, the same passion for these ancestral techniques, which I want to promote through my collections. So I teamed up with some Florentine artisans to make the clothes,"" he explained. 
 
The brand’s gender-neutral clothing targets both men and women, with attention to detail in embroidery, knitwear and dyeing. The brand positioned at the high end of the market is committed to a ""slow and exclusive"" production process.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 18, 2022","Milan’s menswear season opened in sweltering heat Friday, while across Europe Italian premier Mario Draghi was vividly supporting Ukraine’s entrance into the European Union.
 
A major shift in the foreign policy of Italy, which historically maintained rather cordial relations with the former Soviet Union. And notable in a country whose luxury industry has always thrived in Russia and its former satellites. Markets where Italian fashion houses have stopped supplying literally hundreds of franchise stores.
 
Even if here in Milan the dense heat seemed the biggest topic of conversation, with half the audience in shorts, even if the models were dressed up for party action.
 
At DSquared2 – the day’s biggest show - every guy looked determined to have a rollicking good time in acid-dyed denim and beachcomber fantasies. While at Neil Barrett the mood was active-chic for active guys – starring snappy 90s revamps in contemporary fabrics.
 
That said, in a moment when Italian apparel executives are predicting a return to tailoring, at Kiton they softened up the whole mood and silhouette. Understatement at its maximum in the midst of an angry global context.
 DSquared2: Raggedy and RollDesigners have been musing on how to dress men post pandemic for leisure and career, and one clear statement was apparent at DSquared2. Why go to work at all? 
Beachcomber boys, hair astray and everything unbuttoned, wearing patchwork paisley print sarongs over carpet bagger bovver boots opened the action in this show, staged inside a massive new super-sized Super Studio in deep south Milan.
 
Instead of trousers we got silk Indian dhotis; ballooning track pants in imperial purple; cargo pants cut below the knee with pockets big enough to hold copies of War & Peace or loon pants finished in silver metal studs. The same finish seen on some great leather motorbike jackets whose sleeves feature the Honda logo. Plus, jackets were so crumpled, it looked like the cast had slept the night in them before hitting the catwalk.
 
DSquared2’s design duo of Dean and Dan Caten have gone for maximum mash-up mode in recent seasons and the results can be a tad confusing, but the net result this Friday was an optimistic devil may care statement. DSquared2 will always be a brand about celebrating life and living in the moment. Which this collection and show certainly did.
 
Hence their post-pandemic fashion message – flaunt it, and love it, while you can. Especially in your gilded bohemian youth.
 Kiton: Softly, so softly 
One brand reconsidering tailoring is Kiton, perhaps the single most famous gentlemanly sartorial brand in Italy. 
The result was a cool easing up, seen in a presentation inside a giant red cylinder within the courtyard of a storied Milan palazzo. Kiton’s soft elegant tailoring and signature Neapolitan shoulders composed in fresh takes of summery elegance. 
 
The new unruffled and serene attitude coming at a complicated moment for Italian luxury. Kiton has had to stop supplying eight franchise stores in Russia – five of them in Moscow, strictly following the EU’s embargo policy.
 
It’s silhouette and mood, however, is infinitely more relaxed: languid soft herringbone cashmere double-breasted suits, old-world elegance at its modernist best. Slate gray fresh wool suits or faded blood red blazers, all worn with white-rimmed sneakers and loafers.
 
Clothes that whispered quality, even as they hid the wearer’s wealth.
 Neil Barrett: Preternaturally young veteran 
A quarter-century ago, Neil Barrett was a young Turk, or Brit rather, designer revolutionizing menswear. Today, Neil is an elder statesmen, yet he is still breaking rules and reinventing the man’s wardrobe with precision and punch. The collection’s title said it all: 'Urban Oasis'.“I know how to dress myself but I have to dress these guys too,” laughed Barrett, pointing to his cast of rangy hirsute models in his via Ceresio headquarters.
 
Instead of a runway, the UK born designer presented spring/summer 2023 in a great video, projected inside a mini mountain range of dark brown sand.
 
“It’s good to have 10 minutes with people rather than just a quick wave or hug after a show,” added, post show, Barrett, still boasting the whip thin figure of his early days. 
 
Neil dressing his cast in natty perforated neoprene blousons or grommeted surgeon’s tops. He cut holes pretty much everywhere; from white jean knees and ankles, to white ecru knit tops. Barrett has always had a great touch with transparency and layering – using that with great skill in combat vests and anthracite micro-mesh tops. 
 
And when it comes to making an entrance, his redingotes with mirror sides were fabulous and flattering. In a word, this is one fashion veteran whose oeuvre and ideas has rarely looked younger.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 17, 2022","After the Salone del Mobile and Milano Design Week, which attracted a high number of visitors from June 7 to 12, Milan is looking to build on its success with Men's Fashion Week, which kicks off this Friday, June 17 and runs until June 21. Prestigious returnees, newcomer brands and other festivities combine all the elements needed to guarantee an eventful week. 
Spring/Summer 2023 Milan Men’s Fashion Week has 25 runway shows confirmed, of which only five will be in digital format and presented on Tuesday, the event’s last day.

This fashion week will continue to be broadcast online via the platform launched by the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (CNMI) during the pandemic, but will now return to an almost entirely face-to-face program with a total of 70 scheduled appointments between fashion shows and presentations, 65 of which will be held in physical format.The week-long event will conclude with Zegna’s fashion show 120 kilometers away from Milan. The brand has chosen to unveil its latest collection by Alessandro Sartori at its Piedmont headquarters in Trivero, with the Oasi Zegna nature reserve as a backdrop, on Monday, June 21.
 
Dsquared2 will open the event on Friday, putting an end to its co-ed shows, as will Versace, which is also returning to the men's calendar with a menswear show on Saturday. Gucci will also be back at Men's Fashion Week without a runway show but with a presentation instead. 

Major returning brands include Moschino, Plein Sport, Billionaire and Marcelo Burlon County of Milan, which has announced it will host a grand ""after show"" party on Saturday night to celebrate its tenth anniversary. Another party to look forward to will be organized by Boss, which will launch an exclusive collection created with its ambassador, TikToker Khaby Lame, on Friday. Countless other parties will be taking place throughout the week in Milan.

The return to physical fashion shows will serve as an opportunity to finally discover face-to-face multiple new designers that had to settle for digital presentations the last few seasons. These include Indian designer Dhruv Kapoor, new luxury streetwear brand 44 Label Group launched by entrepreneur Claudio Antoniolo together with Berlin-based DJ and producer Max Kosobil, and British designer Jonathan William Anderson. The latter used to stage his shows in Paris and is also creative director of Spanish luxury brand Loewe, owned by the LVMH group. 
 
Keep an eye out for three other new names joining the event this season: Chinese brand Joeone, designed by French designer Louis Gabriel Nouchi who began to present his collections in Paris last year, as well as two Italian brands, Family First, founded in 2015 by Giorgio Mallone and Alessandro Zanchi, and Simon Cracker by designer Simone Botte.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 17, 2022","On Tuesday evening, Wales Bonner excited her audience in Florence with a show full of subtlety, vibrantly blending a variety of influences, techniques, attitudes and ideas. As the special guest of the Pitti Uomo menswear show, the British designer transported a slice of Africa into the heart of Renaissance Italy. More than that, she drew on the city’s multicultural history to write a new chapter with a vista on multiple horizons.To unveil her menswear and womenswear collection for the Spring/Summer 2023, Wales Bonner chose one of the Medici’s most ancient palazzi, the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, built in 1444 by Cosimo de Medici, notably once the home of Alessandro de Medici, known as il Moro (the Moor) for his African origins, the Florentine republic’s first duke.
 
The palazzo’s courtyard and walls are covered entirely with burlap bags, of the kind habitually used to transport foodstuffs, especially from Africa. The bags were recovered and stitched together by Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama, creating an installation with migration as its theme.“My influences aren't drawn from fashion, but from the outside world. I delve into the past to look out to and project myself into the future,” said Wales Bonner, who called on artisans from all over the world to create the collection’s 36 looks, showcasing their unique skills. Experts in tie-dye techniques from Burkina Faso, embroiderers from India to make macramé dresses decorated with pearls, Savile Row tailors to produce a number of wonderful suits, and a Parisian artisan for a silk jacquard coat. As well as jewellery made by Ghanaian artisans using multi-coloured pieces of bottle glass.
 
All of this blends together in a harmonious whole, the silhouettes both elegant and flowing, masculine and feminine, the style at once couture and sporty. Wales Bonner’s wardrobe is a well-balanced composition, featuring zebra and leopard-skin slippers worn with suits, and Adidas sneakers, re-imagined in silver by Wales Bonner, matched nonchalantly with white knee-high socks and ample shorts. 
 
Wales Bonner is equally adept at using a variety of codes, switching from contemporary style to eclectic chic, as with the double-breasted gilet-blazer or the hybrid khaki trench coat, its back enhanced with finely striped white cotton fabric, then adopting a sportier register only to segue with hand-crafted items and end on a rocker flourish, with electric blue suede jackets decorated with silver studs. Notable too are the maxi shirts in blue cotton with white bibs, looking almost like boubous, worn unbuttoned over ample, sarong-style double trousers layered over one another. 
 Wales Bonner, 31, born of a Jamaican father and an English mother, knows exactly what she wants. “I started with menswear, because it's a more structured kind of fashion, and that also allowed me to break some rules. Nowadays, womenswear has the same weight as menswear in my collections,” said the designer, whose couture items are all made in Italy, and whose label is available at 85 top multibrand retailers worldwide, including Sacks, Ssense and Le Printemps.
 
Wales Bonner, who from the outset has put black identity at the heart of her fashion, caught the industry’s eye right after graduating from the prestigious Central Saint Martins academy in London in 2014. Her graduation collection, called ‘Africa’, won the L'Oréal Professional Talent Award. Her first collection, ‘Ebonics’, for the Fall/Winter 2015, was highly praised by critics. In 2015, she received the Best Young Talent menswear collection prize at the British Fashion Council’s Fashion Awards.
 
The following year, she won the LVMH emerging designer prize. “An award that has helped boost my self-confidence,” said Wales Bonner, who is very pleased to have remained independent until now. “More and more I appreciate the freedom I have and the possibility of expressing myself,” she concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 14, 2022","The Accessories Council announced on Monday the honorees for this year’s 26th annual ACE Awards.Taking place on Monday, August 1, the event honors individuals and companies who have furthered the awareness and use of accessories in the fashion industry.

"Jun 13, 2022","Loewe returned to Milan Design Week and set itself apart with a beautiful basketry project that cleverly combined sustainability, creativity and commercial success. Led by its creative director, Irish designer Jonathan W Anderson, the Spanish luxury leather brand owned by the LVMH group took over the grand courtyard of the renaissance palace Isimbardi to unveil “Weave, Restore, Renew”, a carefully curated project that took two years to complete. 
 The brand’s aim is to once again emphasize the craftsmanship that has always characterized Loewe through a sustainable and creative approach centered on three ancestral weaving techniques. The company recovered 240 old wickerwork objects from around the world in a wide variety of styles. The baskets, bags, satchels, and other styles found throughout Europe, China, South America and Japan were handed over to Loewe’s Spanish craftsmen to reconstruct. 
 
Idoia Cuesta, Belén Martínez, Santiago Besteiro and Juan Manuel Marcilla mended and repaired the baskets using leather straps and gave a new life to these objects, some of which had arrived in very bad condition. The regenerated products were displayed around the courtyard during the Salone del Mobile, with a label indicating, among other things, their origin and the number of hours of work employed in their restoration. The items were offered for sale between 1,500 and 3,000 euros, and almost all of them sold out within five days.A second part of the project showcased coroza, an ancient weaving technique from Galicia in northern Spain, using straw, reeds, heather and other natural fibers to make thick straw overcoats and hats to protect the riverbank from the rain. Several examples of these heavy overcoats were displayed in the center of the courtyard. They have inspired the fashion house to turn to the designer and basketry specialist Álvaro Leiro to create a series of bags and baskets with the straw bangs that are typical of this tradition. 
Finally, the last part of the project was assigned to Young Soon Lee, Korean finalist of the 2019 edition of the Craft Prize organized by the Loewe Foundation. The artist used her country’s traditional weaving technique, Jiseung, made from paper strings, to create a series of bags.
 
Loewe wished to illustrate the regenerative power of handiwork through this project, proving that recycling and authentic craftsmanship can be creative and environmentally friendly as well as generate business.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 13, 2022","Deep diving into the archive, but always using contemporary fabrics, designer Mark Weston on Friday presented his clearest fashion statement for the house of Dunhill to date. 
His starting reference, a billowing umbrella coat culled from the archives, but reinvented as a slate-gray layered raincoat, the epitome of understated elegance.
 
Seen in a spring summer 2023 collection shot on the roof of the Woolwich Arsenal, a military structure which is a mix of 19th-century brown brick and huge contemporary glass windows.“It’s a great space to shoot, a blend of the original with modern luster. I wanted that idea of  old meeting new just like in the collection,” explained Weston in a Zoom from Dunhill’s UK headquarters.
 
“The idea was taking special fabrics to make the collection feel lighter than ever. Challenging myself and the team on what we can do,” added Weston, standing before a moodboard including a 1998 Peter Lindbergh shoot from Uomo Vogue, seen back when Mark was working in New York. 
“What I loved about that shoot was everything all shot in profile,” he smiled, the better to highlight super-light fabrics.
 
Like the blend of water-resistant wool and silk used in the new Umbrella coat or in several crisp and classy midnight-blue suits. While a first-rate blazer is composed in second skin leather finished with a super fine membrane to stop ripping.  Totally clean inside, it’s side are perforated, keeping the torso cool. And another super light leather layered car coat is perforated at the back, on the shoulders and behind the  sleeves.
 
Weston confesses to having a “love-hate relationship with seersucker,” but his solution to the conflict is ingenious.  Creating a natty white parka in military seersucker on a ripstock grid of nylon. The same material seen in great utilitarian trousers paired with a black-on-black denim blazer. 
Made in mix of slate, mid gray, ochre and Yale blue, the collection manages to combine drama with fluidity. It will start selling in store and online in early December.
 
Paired with a new range of collapsible leather goods, like pebble leather totes and belt bags finished with a 1893 harness that showcase Dunhill’s origins as a supplier to carriages. New racing semi-wrap auto-racing glasses again riff on the brand’s early days supplying the fledgling auto industry.
 
Seen also in an old turn-of-the-century ad on Weston’s moodboard for Dunhill Motorities, and a gentleman sitting inside an open-top car.
 
“It caught the sense of protection I wanted, but super elevated for today in the finest of cloths,” concluded Weston.

"Jun 9, 2022","Shanghai Fashion Week was the very first fashion week to go digital in March 2020, and thus played a pioneering role during the early stages of the Covid 19 pandemic. Two years later, the event has been forced once again to adopt a virtual format from June 17 to 19.While China's financial capital and its 25 million inhabitants are gradually returning to normality after being in partial and then full lockdown since the last week of March due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, it's too late for the Fall/Winter 2023 Shanghai Fashion Week, which was originally scheduled to take place from March 25 to April 1 and then postponed, to be held in physical form.As announced by the organizers on their official website and on social media, the fashion shows and events of their Fashion Week, organized in partnership with Douyin, will be broadcast mainly on the Chinese version of TikTok and on YouTube, streaming various content such as shows and backstage interviews for six hours every day. Around 30 brands are expected to participate in the event, compared to more than 100 at Shanghai Fashion Week’s last physical edition held in October 2021.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 9, 2022","French fashion school Esmod, the world's oldest fashion academy, will launch in the autumn a course called Meta-Wear, dedicated to digital fashion design. Véronique Beaumont, Esmod’s executive director, spoke to AFP explaining why this course is essential for the next generation of designers, who will be able to juggle artisanal skills, fashion expertise and digital technology, creating a new vision for the future of fashion.Q: Why are you launching the Meta-Wear course on digital fashion design?

A: It was important not only to meet the expectations of new generations of students, but also to adapt to the changes occurring in the fashion industry. We carried out some research on this, and realised that it was crucial to boost our digital software education. This wasn’t an entirely new field, since we have partnered with Lectra for courses focused on modelling and product development, including everything to do with manufacturing, and were already testing the Clo3D software that works with digital avatars. We initially decided to develop Clo3D courses, then the metaverse came into being. One of our lecturers, Fabrice Jonas, founder of MyFashionTech, advised us to go even further and stage fully fledged courses to train students on these new fields. We are truly committed to adapting to the new professional skills required by the metaverse, while still respecting traditional know-how, which is essential in fashion.Q: Will the course focus on teaching digital fashion design only? 

A: The focus will obviously be on product design, but the whole NFT environment and cryptocurrencies will be covered too. However, it will always be a matter of enhancing the physical world. We truly believe that these new virtual worlds will be used by fashion labels primarily to showcase their more classic products. There is an obvious marketing aspect, and this is good because we are always trying to meet the expectations of a new generation of designers with a hybrid mindset. They no longer want to be regarded solely as artisans, but as entrepreneurs too. It’s a generation keen to be able to build their business from very early on. 

Q: Who is this new course addressed to? 

A: The Meta-Wear course will be aimed at second-year students, because we absolutely want [students] to learn the fundamentals of physical fashion in their first year. It’s a development of our curriculum combining Esmod’s long-established, traditional teaching of technical and design methods, with digital techniques. Starting next September, the new course will cover two second-year modules, but students will of course keep following the standard programme at the same time. And we'll even go a little further, in order to train them on new professional skills. We want to make them work in other sectors such as videogaming, since this fits with employers’ demand for new profiles, like metaverse and digital costume designers, for example. 

Q: Do you have to understand videogaming to become a fashion designer nowadays?

A: No, I don’t think so. It’s simply a way for our industry to diversify. The metaverse is a very real phenomenon but, paradoxically, our students are increasingly asking to be taught artisanal skills and hand-crafting. On the one hand there is tradition, on the other modernity. One will not replace the other, they are complementary. Gaming is a very interesting field, and that's why we're going to integrate it into our teaching methods, but designing fashion is synonymous with emotion, physicality, and that is still key. It’s not a question of disavowing Esmod’s DNA, still based on knowing how to make a physical product, but of creating bridges between physical and digital fashion.

Q: In terms of teaching, how does digital fashion differ from physical fashion?
 
A: Digital fashion is very attractive in terms of communication and perception. Teaching is very difficult today, even simply capturing the students’ attention. We have realised that for them digital design is more versatile, more creative, because it moves much faster than physical fashion. But this is also the reason why the two complement each other, and for us, switching completely to digital fashion is out of the question. Some students are not interested in the Meta-Wear course, and prefer craftsmanship or couture workshops. We are keen on [studying] the metaverse, but as a complement to the standard programme. We will soon stage a short course on the metaverse, in partnership with DressX, for Esmod alumni and industry professionals who wish to acquire digital design skills.

Q: Do you think this kind of training could become a must for aspiring fashion designers? 

A: It will all depend on the direction chosen by the student. Digital and physical fashion can by all means co-exist, allowing everyone to do what they prefer. At the end of the 1960s, some people predicted that haute couture would disappear because of the arrival of ready-to-wear, and it’s absolutely clear that this never happened, just as genderless fashion has not replaced either menswear or womenswear. We mustn't be fooled, this is how fashion works. It doesn’t mean that such phenomena won’t make their mark, but they will not supplant fashion’s DNA. However, they allow designers to be more and more creative.

Q: Some fashion names have started to experiment with the various opportunities afforded by the metaverse, with digital fashion and NFT collections, but aren’t not far ahead of the pack?
 
A: I think the industry is indeed pushing forward, but this is normal because it is now driven by a new generation. In the last few years, the fashion industry has been living at this generation’s pace, propelled by highly connected, innovative influencers. Everything changes very quickly, but there may indeed be a gap between this innovative, ultra-connected generation and those consumers who do not necessarily resemble it. It often starts this way. You simply have to look at sustainable fashion, which was of no interest to anyone 10 years ago, and is now at the heart of people's concerns. In fashion, desirability and attractiveness are two very important concepts, so the industry, despite everything, owes it to itself to forge ahead.

Q: Do you see digital fashion as tomorrow's luxury, or as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fashion?

A: This is a tough question. I truly think that digital fashion will simply make it possible to sell more physical products. Everyone is having a go, from leading luxury groups to fast-fashion ones, it’s no random thing. Ultimately, it’s a new way of communicating, one that is much closer to marketing than to design. It’s great to be able to dress an avatar, but we aren’t going to spend all our time in the virtual world. We will always need to buy physical clothes, paying attention to their provenance, their fabrics, and the way they are produced. Digital fashion will instead make it possible to test garments, to see if this or that item is more attractive. As for the luxury industry, it must keep up with the times, of course, but we mustn’t forget that the essential tenet of luxury is high value, a taste for the exceptional, and rarity. This is somewhat the case with the metaverse now, but if it will become more democratic, things might change. In this sense, I don’t think digital fashion is the future of luxury.

"Jun 9, 2022","Celine will stage the final runway event of the upcoming  Paris menswear runway season this month, with a climatic show on Sunday night, June 26. 
Seeing as Celine Creative Director Hedi Slimane has been one of the half dozen most influential menswear designers in the past two decades, the decision is a major boost for the Paris calendar. News of the show emerged on Wednesday on the final schedule of the Paris menswear season, released by the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French high fashion’s governing body.
 
The next Paris menswear season will take place from Tuesday, June 21 until Sunday, June 26, and include such major league names as Dior, Dries Van Noten, Rick Owens, Hermès, Thom Browne, Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garçons.This Celine show will mark the first time that the house has staged a live runway display since was back in February 2020, when it held a co-ed runway show in Paris.
 
Since then, Slimane has restricted himself to shooting elaborately staged video displays inside historic French locations. Like the Negresco Hotel on the Mediterranean shoreline of Nice, and before that in Château Vaux-le-Vicomte, near Paris, or Chambord, the giant Loire Valley chateau.
 
Slimane largely reinvented the menswear runway format back in the late 90s, staging giant yet poetic shows with customized soundtracks that attracted  rock gods like David Bowie, Mick Jagger or Pete Doherty, as Hedi went on to achieve rockstar status himself.
 
In typically quirky manner, so far neither Slimane nor Celine has commented on the decision on their respective Instagram accounts.

"Jun 7, 2022","Roman luxury label Fendi will design the off-pitch wardrobe of AS Roma, one of the Italian capital’s Serie A football teams, for the next two seasons. The looks will be presented at the end of August, at the start of the 2022-23 season.“This unprecedented collaboration originates from shared values and a common heritage, celebrating the city of Rome and two companies founded [in Rome] in quick succession: Fendi in 1925, and AS Roma in 1927,” said Serge Brunschwig, president and CEO of Fendi. 

Silvia Venturini Fendi, Fendi’s creative director for accessories and menswear, has designed a selection of formal and casual outfits featuring the label’s codes of tradition and innovation, with a special focus on artisanal craftsmanship. The common thread of the collection, produced entirely in Italy using high-quality fabrics, is the colour navy blue, symbolising elegance and refinement, combined with the football club’s signature hues, red and yellow.

“What Fendi and AS Roma together mean for the city of Rome, its history and tradition, speaks for itself, and this was the main driver of the collaboration we have jointly created,” said Ryan Friedkin, vice-president of AS Roma. 

“The idea behind this collaboration is reinterpreting the codes and values of Fendi and AS Roma, creating a nexus between sport and the world of fashion through a common denominator: our respective Roman roots and strong connection to the Eternal City,” said Venturini Fendi.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 7, 2022","“It’s all color and movement, and that’s it!” said Silvia Tcherassi.

The Colombian designer was on hand with her children, who have key roles in the business—daughter Sofia Espinosa Tcherassi as director of RTW and Mauricio Espinosa Tcherassi as director of innovation—to present her Resort 2023 collection with a breakfast-slash-fashion show at the new Fasano Restaurant New York. The show was two years in the making, having been initially delayed due to the pandemic.Color and movement summed up the collection that was strong on tiered full skirts and bishop sleeves. Batik fabric treatments, strategic cut-outs, and one-shoulder gowns in an array of bright tropical colors and bold patterns may have suggested a typical Latin style, but daughter Sofia suggests otherwise.

“We design for a specific type of woman, very feminine; we love to cater to entrepreneurs, for instance, but we don’t do a traditional suit,” she said herself sporting a Silvia Tcherassi draped belted white jacket with satin batik print pant, adding “We do it with our DNA and our clientele doesn’t have a nationality, she is a type who wants happiness in her life.”While she notes that being from a hot climate and currently the family resides in Miami does have an influence, the pattern and color aren’t the antitheses of the New York client.

“A business associate said to me, ‘Americans are scared of color, and I disagree. I think English people might fear color, but truly for me, I found it’s a misconception. New Yorkers and Americans love color.”She backs this up with an example. “One of our top three retailers is Bergdorf Goodman, and they are only located in New York City. Saks is always number one, but they have stores around the country.”

The designer Silvia Tcherassi insists it’s the versatility of the clothing. Wearing a long white tunic dress, cream boots, and an oversized embroidered clutch, she remarked that this city ensemble would also be at home in Capri with sandals and a straw bag.

The brand’s North American expansion started five years ago when son Mauricio joined the company and expanded the typically vertical direct-to-consumer brand to wholesale in the United States. “The brand is having a great moment in the U.S., especially in the southern states when the client resonates with our clothing,” he said.

While having previously announced plans to reopen their Bal Harbor retail store post-pandemic in a newer and more prominent space in the mall, the brand executive announced plans for more stores across the American south. Currently, the brand has eleven stores globally with six in Colombia, Madrid and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, among others.

“We are planning to open five more stores in the U.S. in 2023 in cities such as Palm Beach, Houston, Dallas, and Tampa,” said Tcherassi’s son, adding the wholesale partners such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, and Moda Operandi have highlighted where the fans of the brand gravitate. “For example, Tampa. I had no idea that Tampa was a cool market or had a lot of wealth. Today, we have four women who flew up on their private jet from Tampa, a client from the Glazer family of the Tampa Buccaneers, and another connected to Tampa Bay Lightning. There is a lot of American wealth in that city. Maybe they don’t want to go to Miami for the whole scene there, so a lot of money is there. I am eyeing that next and the same with Palm Beach,” he continued.

Events like the Resort show have been vital to brand awareness. “We went to these markets to do trunk shows or runway shows like today, and we have seen an amazing reaction to the brand,” he said, noting an event last September with Tootsies in Houston attended by 400 customers that raised over $400,000 for the Lance McCullers Jr. Foundation.

"Jun 5, 2022","The LVMH Prize had a few surprises in store on Thursday, June 2. A few minutes before announcing this year’s winner (British designer Steven Stokey Daley), Delphine Arnault gave the floor to Olympic medalist Eileen Gu. The professional skier, tasked with awarding the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, shocked those present at the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris by announcing that ""due to the exceptional quality of the competition” the award would go to not only one, but two of the finalists: founder of the brand ERL, Eli Russell Linnetz and Idris Balogun of Winnie New York.Renamed the Karl Lagerfeld Prize in 2019, in honor of the iconic German designer’s tenure as a juror for the LVMH Prize over the years, the award will grant the two American-born designers a one-year mentorship program within the French luxury group as well as €150,000. The award previously known as the Special prize has helped boost the careers of designers and brands such as Hood by Air, Jacquemus, Vejas, and Rokh.  

""Karl Lagerfeld is definitely one of my idols and a fashion legend. To win an award named after him is very exciting,"" Linnetz confessed when speaking to FashionNetwork.com, just after receiving the award which he dedicated to the jury, the Arnaults and his own family. ""ERL was created as an escape, a place to create without asking myself too many questions, a world full of experimentation and risk-taking. But I never expected anyone to wear my clothes,"" beamed the Venice Beach-based designer, who draws much of his inspiration from his homeland.  The 31-year-old fashion designer, who launched his first complete menswear collection in January 2020, described his style as ""relaxed and not always too serious, but with a good story to tell"". His signature label is also defined by ""the colorful and the California vibe,"" which permeate simple, yet sultry interpretations of American basics delivered as menswear, womenswear and genderless collections. ""I've never seen myself as part of the fashion industry. Narrative design is my true passion,"" said the American creative, a self-confessed lover of photography who studied screenwriting in college.

The brand already noticed by Kim Jones

Linnetz designs have so far not only seduced the LVMH Prize jury, but have already earned him a look from the Fall 2021 collection in the 'In America: A Lexicon of Fashion' exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Dior Men's creative director Kim Jones, who also served on the jury, catapulted him into the spotlight last May. A creative alliance between Linnetz and Jones was born out of an informal conversation via Instagram. The British designer, known for his passion for collaborations, chose him to be a surprise guest at Dior's latest runway show in Los Angeles. The Spring 2023 menswear show presented the fruit of the collaboration between the two designers: a maximalist capsule collection filled with vivid colors. As for the future of his brand, which is now available in 85 stores around the world, Linnetz stated how he is planning to expand into new product categories and continue growing his studio.

""Every handcrafted garment made at the studio in Venice is created from repurposed materials. In the future, I would also like to build my own local factory where everything can be manufactured and sold,"" he explained about the importance of upcycling in his brand's DNA. In addition, the creative is considering opening his own store in Paris in the near future. ""It's normal - after all, I've traveled to this city 12 times this year!"" he quipped.From Burberry and Tom Ford to Winnie New YorkThe 29-year-old American Balogun, the man behind Winnie New York, already boasts an impressive track record. The Brooklyn-based designer of Nigerian descent graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and trained at London’s bespoke tailoring street Savile Row before joining the ranks of Burberry, where he worked under Christopher Bailey and oversaw menswear, and then moved to Tom Ford’s made-to-measure department. Balogun went on to present his own brand’s first collection in February 2020 in Paris. 

His brand’s premium positioning and solid trajectory earned him the well-deserved recognition of a jury composed of some of the leading names in men’s fashion, such as Silvia Venturini Fendi, Nigo, and the aforementioned Jones. ""It has been an incredible journey and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to be part of this platform,"" said the designer, dedicating the award to his mother, siblings and friends. In fact, his brand’s roots were also built on family ties.

""I created the brand in tribute to the memory of my grandmother, nothing could make me happier than for her name to be next to Karl Lagerfeld's,"" explained Balogun emotionally to FashionNetwork.com, detailing how his brand’s identity represents ""luxury in its purest form"", opting for classic techniques, craftsmanship, sustainability, tailoring and exquisite fabrics.

Winnie New York's garments are made of natural fibers such as cotton, linen and wool, in order to ""facilitate their recycling"", and its designer encourages the use of recycled materials and leftover stock in his collections. This sustainable approach can be further explored thanks to the credit received by each winner for purchasing fabrics at Nona Source, LVMH’s online resale platform of deadstock fabrics from its fashion and leather goods brands.""I had certain respect, I find it very difficult to speak in public and I did not know what to expect when presenting my brand to the jury, but they made us feel very comfortable and it has been an experience from which I have learned a lot,"" described the designer about the feedback received, detailing that the main questions put forth focused on his brand’s approach, the prospects for his business and its growth potential. These opinions were shared by the remaining 7 finalists of the 2022 edition.

The financial reward of €150,000 will help Balogun recruit employees, as he currently is the only member of his team, expand his brand's product portfolio and develop its online and direct-to-consumer business. In addition, Balogun is finalizing the details of Winnie New York’s upcoming presentation, which is scheduled to take place in Paris on the first day of Fashion Week Men's, June 22.

"Jun 3, 2022","After travelling to Hawaii in March, Jacquemus is going back to its native Provence for its next show. Simon Porte Jacquemus, the designer who founded the French ready-to-wear label and hails from the small town of Mallemort, between Marseilles and Avignon, will present the Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection with a show in Arles, in the south of France, on June 27. 
Three years after staging a show in a lavender field in Valensole, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region, Porte Jacquemus is going back to his roots, returning to sunny southern France, since 2009 the main source of inspiration for his fresh, sensual creations.

Some of the label’s accessories, like the famous tiny handbags and the giant straw hats have been instant best-sellers.

Jacquemus has more than 4.6 million followers on Instagram and employs 100 people, generating a revenue of approximately €25 million. The label recently appointed its first managing director, Bastien Daguzan, an external hiring.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

“Miami Fashion Week is the first global fashion week to bridge the physical-first fashion industry to digital-first Web3 designers and brands together through several Metaverse Group powered metaverse experiences and activations congruent with the week's events. Our Fashion Estate has become a pillar in the virtual fashion community and a popular virtual destination to host metaverse fashion events,” said Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Tokens.com and Metaverse Group executive chair.Lorne Sugarman, CEO of Metaverse Group, said “We are excited to add the L’Atelier to the Luxury Fashion District in Decentraland.

"Jun 2, 2022","On May 30, creative and tech companies met for the We Are Challenges award ceremony organized by the venue dedicated to creativity and technology We Are and the Vivatech event. Two weeks before the big Viva Tech event, which will take place from June 15 to 18 at Porte de Versailles with 1,700 start-ups and 400 people expected to attend, the spotlight was on several promising start-ups that fuse technology with creativity selected out of 168 applications.In the Fashion Tech category, five finalists were in the running under the engaging title: ""The Future of Fashion"". While for its first edition, the event targeted the secondhand market and rewarded the companies Luxurynsight and Faume, it also honored a start-up with an innovative business model that integrated emerging technologies. The jury, composed of investor Pierre Denis; Maeva Bessis, who runs La Caserne; the director of creative industries at BPIFrance Nicolas Parpex; Nicolas Santi-Weil, CEO of AMI; and Diaa Elyaacoubi, CEO of Monnier frères, selected the companies Isla Collective, Nemmès, Today We Are, Veesual and The Second Life. In the end, Nemmès received the 2022 award for its disruptive concept of being an accessible jewelry brand that provides customers the option to customize their pieces. 

Founded by Arnault Daubresque, Julie Pascal and Quentin Leroy, Nemmès allows its customers to easily design their own rings, bracelets, earrings and pendants by selecting different criteria via its website or mobile app.“This was our first time participating in this type of contest,” explained Daubresque. “The presentation was 10 minutes long and the question period should have been 5 minutes, but we exceeded it. It was very informative to be confronted with questions from well-known personalities. I think that what they appreciated was our unique concept of offering a genuinely custom-made product made locally since we work with workshops in France whereas the vast majority of accessible jewelry is made in Asia. It’s a combination of technology and know-how"".

The members of the jury were not the only people to be seduced by Nemmès' products. The young brand, which employs a dozen people, is currently preparing its first pre-seed funding round with financial investors. This operation should allow the company to develop a technical solution to add stones onto its jewelry. For the moment, its pieces, which start at 69 euros, are made with renewable and recycled brass. Nemmès, which for the moment produces hundreds of pieces of jewelry each month, must now build on the success of its business model. This is an essential step for a young company that aspires to be the next Pandora.

Other candidates also proposed practical solutions for companies. The Second Life, for instance, offers real estate companies and brands solutions for recycling used clothing and reusing waste.

Veesual provides brands with tools that allow them to visualize the rendering of a collection on different types of models. The start-up launched this service together with La Redoute for women's lingerie with, for the moment, three different models (one model of sub-Saharan African origin, one of Asian origin and a curvy model of European origin). Additional profiles and product categories will be available to users in the near future.

Isla is an upcycling fashion marketplace that focuses on taking old clothing and giving them a new life. The company launched in 2020 has already carried out projects with Citadium and Fusalp and is looking to work with secondhand platforms.

Last but not least, Today We Are is a young start-up that is developing a marketplace based on live shopping technology and highlighting the performance of this sales channel in China, arguing that 1.5 million French people have participated in a virtual session in 2020.

During the evening, the company Pianity received the award for start-ups in Web 3.0 and creative industries and the company Vocalcoach was recognized for its innovative education technology solutions.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 2, 2022","Don Draper would be experiencing some serious FOMO if he wasn't fictitious.

The stereotypical 1960s Madison Avenue creative director and protagonist of Mad Men, would have a field day in 2022 where the worlds of physical, digital, and the metaverse converge in advertising, marketing, and content. In these three worlds, Matte Projects manifests its creative storytelling projects. The agency, founded in 2011, has recognized and cultivated the talent community crucial to their work as the medium shifted from IRL (in real life) to online.

Enter the 'Originators', a global creative community that draws visual artists, creative directors, photographers, filmmakers, chefs, writers, and painters who work alongside the agency developing campaigns and projects that spotlight hype, narrative, and design.Matte Project is led by Matt Rowean, chief creative officer and partner; Max Pollack, co-founder and managing partner; Brett Kincaid, founding partner; Francesca Valente, head of talent; and Tom Lee, creative director. FashionNetwork.com caught up with the team via email to break down what these ""creatives-behind-the-creatives"" do.

Anyone who followed the work of Ye and Yeezy in the last two-and-a-half years has seen Matte Projects' work; i.e the Donda album launch and Yeezy X Gap.In December of 2021, according to Rowean, the firm shot the first-ever live concert in IMAX with Ye and Drake at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The firm is known for its work in the luxury sector as well.""On the services side, this is so constant it's hard to single out one. Next week, we are doing an event with Givenchy, work a lot with Bottega Veneta, and just completed a very cool event with Mark Ronson and Audemars Piguet that involved Originator Director Andre Bato,"" said Rowean, adding, ""On the Matte IP side, our next big project will be during NFT.NYC in June.""

A good example of their scope of production for a luxury company is Cartier. A marquee experiential event was the French jeweler's Haute Joaillerie Gala featuring glittering jewelry in an expansive glasshouse on Governor's Island in New York City with a performance by Stevie Nicks. They also worked with the jeweler on Met Gala imagery of bold-face names wearing the high jewelry and their work for Cartier has earned them Clio Awards. For Gucci they’ve created experiences at Art Basel Miami.Matte hopes to make household names of these Originators versus other talents who, in the past, were tucked behind the scenes.

""Another shift [in the agency] has been our belief in putting talent front and center, one reason for starting Originators. Our industry's 'old way' was to protect your source, keep talent behind the scenes mainly out of fear of poaching or that clients didn't like the concept of talent that wasn't in house,"" continued Rowean. 

Pollack described the evolution of the typical creative agency to a brand in this way. ""We're now at Creative Agency 3.0. 1.0 was just getting it started, building the skills of production, curation, and design. 2.0 was producing, becoming masters of the craft, and creating award-winning campaigns, Emmy nominated documentaries, and massive experiences around the world. Now at 3.0, it's moving beyond a creative agency that produces amazing work and into Matte being the platform,"" he explained.

Rowean, Pollack, and the rest of the team are breaking the mold by cultivating top creator talents and giving them a direct voice with clients.

""Originators help establish the look, feel and purpose [of a project] and holistically produce from digital to content to experience. It's an ecosystem model of creativity that we're trying to propagate,"" added Pollack.""Originators is a new way to put talents in the spotlight and support the creation and promotion of original content. Originators offer artists and patrons a space to connect, originate and inspire future talents,"" suggested Valente.

Lee feels standing out from the crowd is crucial to be an Originator. “The criteria is originality. In this industry, qualities like imagination, craft, cultural acumen are almost par for the course. Putting something legitimately and distinctly original into the world is a step beyond that and its value cannot be overstated,” he believes.

Suppose one considers the typical creative director and client role, especially in the context of working photoshoots. In that case, Matte Projects breaks down the hierarchy that kept many on the team from adding to the vision.

Perhaps the most known of the inaugural batch of Originators is DJ and producer trans woman Honey Dijon who has appeared in campaigns for both Bottega Veneta and Calvin Klein and laid the tracks for Kim Jones' shows for Louis Vuitton.Wunderkind young chef Flynn McGarry makes the list, as well as designer, activist and academic, and leading expert on indigenous technologies, Julia Watson.

Others, such as Benjamin Gordon and Oscar Zabala, come from more traditional agency roles. 

""Benjamin was one of our first 'proof cases'. He had been our digital creative director for years before going off on his own to pursue a true arts direction; we wanted to support that in every way possible. Bringing him on as one of the artists at Matte Black and providing him a budget to showcase his work and perform live was a full-circle moment for us,"" said Rowean.

Oscar Zabala worked for Matte as a commercial photographer, 3D artist, and creative specialist.

Matte Projects helped him stage his first fine art exhibit, something Rowean described as ""mandatory,"" and recruited the Matte community to attend.

""Oscar's opening also had great synergy to what we're doing with our web3 platform Matte.Word, where we provided special preview access to our Discord and Black badge holders,"" he added referring to the members-only NFT art, merchandise collaborations and artist exhibit space in the metaverse.

The IMAX concert hasn't been the only film with which the agency-slash-platform-slash-brand has been involved. They also co-produced the Netflix documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened about the infamous ill-fated island music festival. Had the event not gone belly up and were it sponsored by legitimate luxury and consumer brands; it could have been the type of event Matte Projects would have slickly produced.

According to Pollack, more are on the way. ""We have a few original films in development. One is on tokenism in the fashion industry which we're developing with a few Originators. We also are developing a series inspired by Lo-Tek, Julia Watson's monograph.""

"Jun 1, 2022","Haute couture in Paris this July will feature collections by 29 houses as the season bounces back from the pandemic, according to the provisional calendar just released on Wednesday afternoon. 
However, the four-day season will be devoid of several prominent houses, including two Russian couturiers who have shown in Paris for the past several years – Ulyana Sergeenko and Yanina Couture.
 
That said, powerhouses like Christian Dior, Chanel, Elie Saab, Giorgio Armani Privé, Balenciaga and Fendi Couture will all stage live shows in next month’s season, which debuts on Monday, July 4 and ends Thursday evening, July 7, according to the schedule released by the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French high-fashion’s governing body.Only Paris boasts two annual seasons of haute couture, the true laboratory of the industry and the highest expression of fashion on the planet. A rarefied world of barely 2,000 clients – movie stars, princesses and billionaire’s wives – which each January and July takes over the French capital, clogging the streets with chauffeured limousines and booking out all the best restaurants.
 
By far the biggest debut will be by Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing at Jean Paul Gaultier, the third guest designer invited in by Jean-Paul to stage a guest collection for the quirky French modernist marque. While Spanish couture star Juana Martin has won the honor of makng her first appearance on the official calendar. 
The season kicks off on Monday morning with Schiaparelli, which American couturier Daniel Roseberry has made into one of the hottest luxury brands in fashion, and finishes on Thursday evening with veteran French couturier Adeline André.
 
All told there will be 29 brands, and 27 shows. Only Christophe Josse and Maison Rabih Kayroux will not stage physical shows, and just appointments by rendezvous.
 
Several other brands are sitting out the season, including happening young star Charles de Vilmorin and French rock glamour marque Azzaro.

In other news, Jacquemus, the Instagram-driven hipster French house will stage its next show in Arles on June 27, the day after the six-day Paris menswear season ends. Furthermore, Paco Rabanne, Patou and the house of Alaïa will present their women’s ready-to-wear collections on Sunday, July 3, at 4:30 PM, 6 PM and 8 PM CET respectively.

All told, after several years of cancelled shows and largely digital seasons due to the pandemic, Paris couture suddenly looks in final fettle.

"May 31, 2022","The outbreak of the pandemic forced 080 Barcelona Fashion to opt for a digital format to guarantee its survival like so many other international fashion events. Barcelona fashion week intends to take advantage of this accelerated transition towards new technologies and formats while exploring hybrid options to strengthen its positioning and its plans for global expansion.""We have used this period of transition to define exactly where we want to go. Small scale fashion weeks are rapidly evolving, and we have to be very flexible moving forward,"" explained Marta Coca, director of the 080 Barcelona Fashion event, regarding the editions held in digital format since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. Only one event, a ""première"" organized last April, was held in person. The physical event saw 300 guests while the fashion week presented the ""fashion film shows"" of 22 designers and brands. Among them, names such as Custo Barcelona, Paloma Wool, Is Coming, Avellaneda or Eñaut stood out. The designs were immortalized at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona (MACBA) for the first time.Finding the right dates""We started to organize this edition during the Omicron wave and we had to be cautious with the physical attendance part, but our appraisal has been positive. We are satisfied and we have had a more qualitative than quantitative return, which reflects our positioning, values and DNA,"" said the head of the fashion event sponsored by the Government of Catalonia through the Consortium of Trade, Crafts and Fashion (CCAM). The project has an annual budget of 3 million euros, split between its two editions.The change in dates was essential to achieve favorable results. ""Initially, the change of dates had to be made due to sanitary conditions. But now we have left the international calendar out of our own free will,"" said Coca, acknowledging that the event becomes ""invisible"" in the months of January and February, given the difficulties of carving out its own niche during the major international fashion weeks season. ""We don't have to go back to our former dates, we want to separate the fashion week from the traditional calendar to increase awareness"", said the leader of the event which will hold its next dates in October this year, when it will celebrate its 30th anniversary, and in April 2023. Meanwhile, the 080 Barcelona Fashion Connect event will be held separately in March like it was during its last edition.A non-traditional hybrid future""We are a public initiative, a modest platform on an international level, but well positioned in terms of quality"", boasted Coca in terms of the evolution of the fashion event, which has been working for two years on a micro-segmentation strategy that ""is now beginning to bear fruit"". This growth is based on the premise of changing the paradigm and expanding beyond collections or seasons, so that 080 Barcelona Fashion becomes a ""vehicle of expression"" to establish brands in the long term. ""We want to test formulas and not abandon the whole path we have taken since the pandemic. Public fashion weeks can renew their program constantly, not just every few months,"" said the director, recognizing that ""it makes no sense to have an event that only holds shows twice a year, but rather to function more like a Netflix for accessible fashion"".Under this 360º approach, 080 Barcelona Fashion will explore streaming outside the dates of the event as a tool ""better adapted to the viral marketing strategies for brands"" and will rely on the digital format to experiment more with gender identity, without the need to present collections in a male or female fashion week. ""It is necessary to adapt the presentation schedule to the needs of digital native brands or established brands that need to rejuvenate their targets,"" said the manager, detailing that not all firms need to present their collections twice a year.

On combining this digital approach with the physical realm going forward, the director is willing to try new formats. ""Creators miss physical formats and CEOs love digital formats. We will have to combine both,"" said Coca, announcing that the platform is looking into the possibility of holding one physical and one digital catwalk a year to cater to all strategies. She also stressed the need to reassert Barcelona as a powerful ""European capital"", merging relevant initiatives in fashion, crafts, tourism, culture and gastronomy.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"May 26, 2022","Dr Martens is linking up again with the Heaven by Marc Jacobs brand, the project that since its launch in summer 2020 “has embodied nostalgia for the youthful rebellion of the 90s — a technicolour manifestation of a binary-defying, forward-facing generation”.That description feeds pretty well into what Dr Martens has been doing for decades so it’s no surprise that it’s back for more after an earlier sold-out link-up with the label.

This time it has worked with Heaven creative director Ava Nirui and “explores new ways to play with two DM’s silhouettes that capture the playful, distorted femme edge that defined the 90s — and still captivate today”.The pieces include a reworking of the classic feminine/children’s Mary Jane that moves it towards a more rugged look rooted in the 1980s. It comes with “durable welted construction and tonnes of attitude”. 

“From a traditional school shoe to a subversive staple. Paris runways, grunge gigs, Harajuku streets,” the new Mary Jane-styled Addina Double Stitch Bex “dials up the distortion to new levels”.

It’s built using Dr Martens’ classic black Smooth leather, stacked on a 1.5-inch Bex outsole — and detailed with a double yellow welt stitch “for an exaggerated dose of rebellious DM’s spirit”. The strap is finished with a brushed silver buckle featuring Heaven’s instantly recognisable double-headed bear logo. The shoe is detailed with a black and yellow scripted AirWair heel loop.

The grunge-inspired collection also includes an adjustable two-strap version of its Ricki sandal — built on its lightweight 1.9-inch Quad Neoteric platform sole. 

The sandal upper is constructed using black Brando leather, and the straps also feature a brushed silver clasp with Heaven’s double-headed bear. It’s finished with the DM’s signature yellow welt stitch and a dual-branded moulded rubber label on the ankle.

The collection launches at retail in 6 June on the label’s webstore and via select partners.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"May 17, 2022","After leading the American fashion organization for the past three years, Tom Ford announced that he would step away from his role as chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).

He will step down as of May 31, 2022, and chief executive officer Steven Kolb will fulfill the duties as interim chair through December 31, 2022.The debonair designer elevated the presence of American fashion at a time when New York Fashion Week was in danger of losing its relevance due to an arduous lengthy calendar filled with commercially driven clothing that often-lacked inspiration on a runway.

While some industry folks may be scratching their heads thinking ""that was fast,"" according to the release issued by the CFDA, Chairpersons/Presidents typically hold the role for two to four years. Ford's role was intended to last two years, June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2021, but was extended one year.That two-to-four years concept was eclipsed by Stan Herman, currently on the board as treasurer, who held the post for 15 years (1991-2006), and Diane Von Furstenberg, who had it for 13 years (2006-2019).

Previous Chairpersons/Presidents—Sydney Wragge (1963-1965); Norman Norell (1965-1973); Oscar de la Renta (1973-1976, 1987-1989); Herbert Kasper (1977- 1979); Bill Blass (1980-1981); Mary McFadden (1982-1983); Perry Ellis (1984-1986); Carolyne Roehm (1989-1991)—held the roles for the typically designed periods.

One trait that Ford brought to the role was an international perspective, thanks to his time at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent and his established design studio and held runway shows in London when he founded his namesake brand in New York. His predecessors were Seventh Avenue-born designers and brand leaders.
 
Ford's critics were easy to pipe up that his brand, now based in Los Angeles—where the designer lives with his son—was not ideal for the role. It didn't help when the designer chose to show his second collection as CFDA Chair in Los Angeles in February of 2020, but Ford had made it a point to show it there during the Oscars in previous seasons. He was quick to remind naysayers that it stood for the ""Council of Fashion Designers of America and not the Council of Fashion Designers of New York,"" according to BoF.

He expanded on this in WWD: ""The decision to show in February in Los Angeles feels very natural to me. It is my home and has a strong impact on the way that I live and work within both the fashion and film worlds. There is an excitement in L.A. on that particular weekend, and the relationship between film and fashion is a strong one. In my role as chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, my main intent and priority is to globalize and bring attention to American fashion. There is truly no bigger or more prominent stage in the world at any given time than Los Angeles during the Academy Awards.""

More recently, Ford returned to New York for his Spring 2022 showing in September of 2021, just days before his beloved husband, fashion journalist Richard Buckley died on September 19, 2021, at the age of 72. The pair had been together since their first meeting when Buckley was a reporter at WWD and Ford was a designer at Perry Ellis.

The couple spent more than three decades together. Ford told WSJ, ""It's been hard after 35 years, very hard. I keep thinking, 'Oh, God, I have to call Richard,' or I need to send him a note about this. And he's not here.""

Ford's business faced another hurdle when the designer had to cancel his Fall 2022 runway show slated for NYFW due to issues caused by the omicron. The virus wreaked havoc on design and production room staff in Los Angeles and Italian factories, which prevented his collection from being finished on time. This was a particular sting to the NYFW season, which had noticeable absences such as The Row, Oscar de la Renta, Marc Jacobs, and buzzy up-and-coming designer Christopher John Rogers. One lasting effect of the pandemic was opening a door for designers to depart from the traditional physical time frames and formats of a typical runway fashion week.

During his term, Ford initiated key initiatives on behalf of the CFDA. First up, he diversified the board by adding four new directors Virgil Abloh, Carly Cushnie, Maria Cornejo, and Kerby-Jean Raymond. According to an undisclosed source, Ford felt strongly about this mission and predated much of the industry's inclusion efforts that sprung up following the Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020.

This was backed up by initiating new programs to bring much-needed diversity, equity, and inclusion to the fashion industry, including CFDA Impact to identify, connect and support thousands of talents through diversity, equity, and inclusion work, and partnering with brands to provide access to hundreds of rewarding jobs, opportunities, and mentorships.

Additionally, he led A Common Thread with Vogue, which distributed over $5 million in relief aid to fashion businesses during the first two years of the pandemic – 79% of them women and minority-owned businesses—which kept many companies afloat when their businesses were at a standstill.

He also strengthened NYFW by tightening the official NYFW schedule to five days and five nights. This was a big move since previously it was sometimes as long as eight days and highly criticized for being that long and overfilled with shows often left best to the showroom selling floor.

The collection schedule is a point of contention in New York. IMG also releases a program that differs from the official NYFW CFDA-released schedule, often making the two organizations seemingly go toe-to-toe. Ford's presence helped forge a stronger alliance with IMG. He also launched the American Collections Calendar to include all American designers regardless of when and where they are showing as one act of cohesion.

He also allowed designers to stand out further in the marketplace by launching Runway360, CFDA's innovative digital platform to showcase and sell collections.

Bridget Foley, a New York-based fashion journalist who wrote texts for Tom Ford 001 and 002, thought the American designer was the right choice.

""Tom was the perfect person to succeed DVF as CFDA chair – he's a glamorous, international star with a no-nonsense, get-to-work attitude. He took on the role determined to increase American fashion's global profile and reputation. He also wanted to tighten the very long NYFW,"" she said via email.

She added that Ford accomplished ""the latter and made progress towards the former– a process. But then along came Covid-19, and the CFDA's focus shifted to survival techniques. Perhaps lost in the pandemic nightmare is that Tom recognized immediately the need to open the CFDA to new and different voices.""

The news will have the industry buzzing with his potential successor. Currently, the board consists of Tracy Reese (Vice Chairwoman), Vera Wang (Secretary), Stan Herman (Treasurer), Stacey Bendet, Bethann Hardison, Dao-Yi Chow, Prabal Gurung, Tommy Hilfiger, Norma Kamali, Michael Kors, Reed Krakoff, Ralph Lauren, Ashley Olsen, Italo Zucchelli, and Diane von Furstenberg, Maria Cornejo, Kerby Jean-Raymond, and Carly Cushnie.

"May 16, 2022","Rumours had been rife for a few months, and now official confirmation of the eagerly awaited collaboration between Jacquemus and Nike has arrived. French designer Simon Porte Jacquemus had always dreamed of teaming up with the US sport apparel and equipment giant, joining the Nike family in the wake of Virgil Abloh and many others. The dream has now become reality. The fruits of this collaboration will hit the market this summer, and will be available as an exclusive advance preview on the Jacquemus e-shop from June 28.Jacquemus x Nike is a summer collection consisting of unisex accessories and a number of women’s ready-to-wear items, from biker shorts to pleated skirts and halter-neck dresses. It will be unveiled at Jacquemus’s next physical runway show, scheduled for June. “For this collaboration with Nike, I wanted to create a collection that reinterprets athletic women’s sportswear in a minimalistic way. It was important for the collection to be accessible to all body shapes, and that it blended Jacquemus style and Nike performance,” said Porte Jacquemus in a press release.

“I have always been inspired by vintage ACG pieces and Nike campaigns from the ’90s. With this imagery in mind, we designed athletic wear for women with sensuous details and neutral colours, along with my own interpretation of the Humara, my favourite Nike shoe,” added Porte Jacquemus, who has always been drawn to the world of sports, and in this collection combined a gym and fitness aesthetic with that of outdoor apparel, tapping the Nike archives.
 “When we collaborate at Nike, it’s always a 50-50 union, where each partner comes together to advance the other forward in ways that couldn’t have been done alone. With Jacquemus, we drew inspiration from vintage ACG apparel, from the interwoven Nike Dri-Fit fabric, and from footwear like the Humara, to create a nexus of sport and style,” said Jarrett Reynolds, Nike vice-president of catalyst apparel design, underlining how this kind of collaboration “allows us to expand the culture of sport and redefine it for the next generation.”The two partners, keen to create yet more buzz around the project and to whet their fans’ appetite and anticipation for the collection, have not yet released any picture of the collaboration. They have only circulated a few teasers featuring the Nike x Jacquemus logo: a tennis court viewed from above, set on what looks like sand by the seaside, with two intertwined female silhouettes.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 16, 2022","Tom Ford is stepping down as Chairman of the CFDA, bringing down the curtains on a three-year terms at the organization, American fashion’s governing body. 
Ford, who served as Chairman of the CFDA since June of 2019, will end his three-year term on May 31st, according to a statement on the CFDA’s official website.

CFDA CEO Steven Kolb will assume the duties of Interim Chair through December 31, 2022.  In this position, he will remain accountable to the Board with Board oversight. The Board’s current officers – Vice-Chair Tracy Reese, Secretary Vera Wang, Treasurer Stan Herman – will remain in place for the remainder of the year.
“When I began my role as Chairman in June of 2019, my goal was to help the American fashion industry become more globally recognized for its talent and importance,” Ford said in a statement.“I could not have imagined the extraordinary circumstances that both the industry and the world would have to navigate – that a pandemic would shut the world down and change the course of our lives and of our businesses forever. The pandemic challenged all of us to think about our businesses in new ways – from the design process and production, to how we reach and speak to our customers. We were forced to come up with creative new ways to run our companies,” added the Texan born designer.
 
“Some may think that fashion is just about making beautiful clothes and accessories or having runway shows, dressing celebrities and throwing parties without considering the incredible amount of work that goes on behind the scenes, or that the fashion industry is a $3 trillion industry that employs millions of individuals,” Ford continued.
 
The Board unanimously elected Tory Burch, Thom Browne, and Aurora James to the Board, effective June 1, the CFDA added.
The Board will vote on a new Chairperson in the fall to start in January in alignment with CFDA’s fiscal calendar.

"May 11, 2022","The house of Pierre Cardin has unveiled a new durable development prize entitled Prix Bulles Cardin, whose first winners will be presented during the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. 
The prize is named after the Palais Bulles, the futurist, bubble shaped villa built by the designer and located at Theoule-sur-Mer, a few kilometers west of Cannes, hanging from a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean. The opening award will take place on May 18, during the festival’s 75th edition.
 
Since the death of Pierre Cardin in December 2020, the house has been led by his nephew Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin. An engineer by training, Rodrigo intends on unveiling a collection made of fully recycled fabrics to celebrate the centenary of the birth of the founder.The house’s multi-license business model was once revolutionary but is now atypical. However, today it still boasts some 180 licenses spread over 140 countries, giving it unique leverage to introduce more environmentally positive production and distribution systems via its licensees.
 
“Fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world after the oil business, so we have a duty to react and redirect the fashion business. It’s something my uncle believed in strongly,” said Rodrigo in a press conference inside Maxim’s, the famed Art Nouveau restaurant in Paris the founder acquired in 1981. 
This January, the house staged its first collection since Cardin’s passing, focusing on space exploration in a show entitled Cosmocorps 3022, and staged in the Air and Space Museum at Le Bourget airport.
 
Subsequently, the house developed Objectif Terre, or Objective Earth, a series of partnerships with the likes of the European Space Agency, Arianespace and the Spatial Center of Guyana (CSG), which all participate in Copernicus – a joint satellite project to continually scan and map the condition of the planet.
 
The new Prix Bulles Cardin is designed to distinguish five important projects or personalities who have acted to encourage great ecological development. These can include cinema studios, actors or directors; international organizations acting to defend the environment; activist media; or universities. A further Prix d’Honneur will award 50,000 euros to a young generation start-up,  project or individual with a dynamic eco-project.
 
In addition, during the first annual prize giving, a giant series of satellite images culled from the Copernicus world mapping will swathe the Palais Bulles.

"May 11, 2022","When 17 female fashion professionals got together in New York City in 1928, the women presumably faced a pressing 'ism' in the industry: sexism.

While hardly alone at that time, for an industry aimed primarily at women, it seemed natural for their voices to be heard and their work noticed. This was one basis of the group's founding. Fast-forward to Fashion Group today, and members come in every gender, creed, and color. At the 2022 Rising Star Awards, banishing all the 'isms' was not only one theme of keynote speaker Rebecca Moses' speech but also evident in the vast array of nominees, presenters, and guests.Maryanne Grisz, President and CEO of Fashion Group International, deserved kudos for the assortment of seasoned industry leaders and legends she included in the presentation of the awards given to brands and designers whose businesses are less than six years old.

The lineup for the oversold luncheon award ceremony held at Pier 61's The Lighthouse included: designer Jason Wu, presenting the Entrepreneur of the Year Award to Cole Wassner; designer Tracy Reese and actress Lisa Arrindell, presenting the President's Award for Excellence to nineties fashion darling Byron Lars; Andrea Rosso of Diesel presenting Mimi Prober with the Sustainability Award; stylist Freddie Leiba presenting the Accessories Award to Betzabe Gonzalez of Mia Becar shoes; publicist Kelly Cutrone presenting the All Gender Award to Tristan Detwiler of Stan; Keita Moore presenting the Beauty Award to Mantas Butkus of Moérie; Graff Executive Marc Hruschka presenting the Fine jewelry Award to Julie Lamb; Pyer Moss' founder and designer Kerby-Jean Raymond presenting the Menswear Award to Christian Juul Nielsen of Ankvas; and Elle editor-in-chief Nina Garcia presenting the Womenswear designer to Frederick Anderson.In an unusual tie, retail guru Ken Downing presented Nancy Volpe Beringer of The Vault (disability-inclusive fashion resale) and Nyakio Grieco of Thirteen June (beauty brand for the BIPOC community) with the New Retail Award. Industry financer Gary Wassner presented the Hilldun: Business Innovation Award to Karen Williams of Savitude, a sizing and shape app.

Byron Lars is the nineties design wunderkind known for his expert draping, which reimagined classic men's shirting. Lars had stepped out of the limelight, quietly producing a more commercial-focused line Byron Lars Beauty Mark, before launching In Earnest in 2021. It was a treat to see Lars receive an industry nod as his designs were oft copied, and while not the first, he was a prominent Black designer during a time the industry wasn't that diverse.
 
While accepting the award, he pointed out that Earnest was his middle name and his father's name. More importantly, for him and his long-time design partner Sheila Grey, the word's definition had meaning. ""Earnest means existing to a greater extent or more intensely than before,"" he told the audience.

FashionNetwork.com caught up with Lars post-show to find out what he liked most and least about today's different fashion climate.""Social media became a real vehicle to tell your story your way. The immediacy of customer reaction and how customers form a community sharing what they like and didn't like was great information to have me make it better. It was better without the retail filter in between,"" he offered.
 
On the other hand, Lars said, ""I miss the days of the true merchant, that old-time retailer that got their hands dirty getting out to see everything. They had the intention of finding new great things,"" he continued.

Stating a firm belief in those classic brick-and-mortar retailers, Lars said, ""Our price point is too high for her to click and buy in 17 seconds. We have to prove ourselves to her first, and she needs to experience that in person.""

Keynote speaker Rebecca Moses recalled her unlikely (but well-deserved) role replacing Gianni Versace as Genny's head designer before relaunching her label in Italy. Referring to herself as the poster child for survival and reinvention, she shared her own story to inspire this current batch of rising stars and guests of the event.
 
""Being on a creative journey leads you to new challenges; we evolve from good and bad experiences. Passion and discipline are key to survival,"" she advised noting that ""'impossible,' 'can't,' and 'won't' were never a part of my vocabulary.""

She continued by remarking that today's design world requires an in-depth understanding of cultures, lifestyles, ethnicities, and generations. ""Creativity is a voice of the time we live, and we live in extraordinary times,"" she continued.
 
""We must bury these 'isms' that poison our world and affect many of us: racism, ageism, sexism, and classism,"" she said, calling out one which particularly resonates throughout the industry. ""Many of you in the room have been forced out of a job for various reasons. How about because you are 55 and considered too old and not relevant? Do you accept that? Is age a barometer of relevance?""

While presenting the Menswear Award, Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss cautioned he hadn't ""spoken for two years, so bear with me. We are two years older now, and I'm happy to see everyone with their masks off. I like to see your noses.""
 
Jean-Raymond was a former Rising Star Award winner in 2014. ""The FGI award was the first fashion award I received, and by then, I had already had three brands fail and ten years of trying to do it over and over again. This group was the first to recognize me after never giving up and continuing to try,"" he said while thanking the organizations for their work in recognizing new talents.
 
Nina Garcia closed the ceremony by presenting Frederick Anderson, remarking on the last time she had given out an award in 2016. ""It was to Brandon Maxwell, and he is now a global luxury brand. Every brand nominee here has the same potential; you are the future,"" she said.
 
During the red carpet arrivals, Anderson told FashionNetwork.com that after 20 years in the business, ""It was time to leap. You grow up, stop doing it for others, and do it yourself.""

Just barely five years into his label, Anderson said he is doing well in part thanks to his biggest partner Saks Fifth Avenue and the post-pandemic events boom.

""This summer, my direct-to-consumer is on fire with weddings. One client said I have six weddings in the next four months,"" he said, noting the predicted 22 million weddings planned in 2022 in the U.S. alone. ""I'll take all of them!""
 
While accepting the award, Anderson pointed out that Fern Mallis—former CFDA Executive Director known for founding NYFW and former Senior Vice President of IMG Fashion—queried how he could be a rising star after being in the business for 20 years.

""Great question, Fern. Now I am Frederick. I started with Black.like.me (in 2017), and I built what I thought was a dialogue. I continue to tell those stories that I think are important for myself that I share with my clients and friends,"" he said.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 10, 2022","Etam -- organizer of the ‘Live Show’ held in Paris where the French brand showcases its lingerie designs since 2009 -- is delivering a new special event. While luxury houses unveil their cruise collections in vacation spots, like Chanel in Monaco on May 5, the mid-range lingerie brand is orchestrating its first swimwear fashion show to be held on May 12 at 6:30 pm on a secret beach in Corsica. The event will be broadcasted live on the brand's Instagram account, which publicized the event to its social media followers and announced a contest granting two winners an invitation to the physical show. One hundred guests, journalists and influencers, are expected to attend.

The lingerie brand founded in 1916 and boasting 860 points of sale in 50 different countries will present around 40 pieces from its summer 2022 beachwear collection. The models' makeup looks will be designed by MAC Cosmetics and their hair styled by Bumble and Bumble.Etam is leveraging the event to launch its first NFTs. The virtual counterparts of the show's looks will be available to the general public as well as industry professionals. This first cruise show will also enable Etam to communicate internationally since the brand entered the American market last March. Its products are sold in corners installed in ten Nordstrom department stores across the country, while it plans to open 24 stores in the United States by 2025.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 9, 2022","The public event dubbed ‘DRP’ will be held from June 23 to 25 at the Grand Palais Ephémère in Paris, opposite the Ecole Militaire. The venture has been in the making for over two years. Its first edition orchestrated by the trade show organizer WSN Développement, will take place both in real life (IRL) and in the metaverse, targeting young fashion, video gaming, basketball, skateboarding, sneakers and Web3 enthusiasts against the backdrop of ‘drop culture’ (drops refers to collections with a limited number of pieces to ensure rarity) that, according to the organizer, has won over the Gen Z audience. The new event will take place in the heart of Paris during Men's Fashion Week (June 21-26), two days before a Chanel event that will occupy the same venue.

""Our goal was to organize a cool event that has never been done before in Paris,"" explained Frédéric Maus, CEO of WSN. ""Of course there have been attempts, such as Zalando, which wanted to relaunch Bread & Butter in a format open to the general public.""""Our idea was to offer a point between the festival, the event and the shop. And doing it during Fashion Week was important since this generation, highly tuned in to the fashion world, hears about fashion shows, but they don't have access to them. That's why we want to give them some type of access and a place... To do this, we have entered a relationship with influential industry players who federate communities around them,” he added.

It's hard to speak about 'drops' without associating the word with the sneaker world. One of the driving forces of the event will be the return of the show dedicated to sneaker collectors, Sneakerness, after nearly three years of absence in Paris. It will occupy an entire area of the Grand Palais Ephémère.

Sneakerness alone should attract sneakerheads from all over Europe. Video games and Web3 will also be on the agenda with the participation of several e-sports teams, who will offer special products for the occasion. Three games will be unveiled during the event. NFT and metaverse players will be represented by the virtual fashion e-shop, DressX.

To validate the Gen Z seal, the DRP event will host a skate park together with the Cosanostra association and a 3X3 basketball court, while the Red Star soccer club will present its new jersey alongside Vice.70 fashion brands to discover on siteAs expected of a WSN Développement event, fashion will also make an appearance. It will take center stage at the Grand Palais with the attendance of 70 brands, young streetwear labels such as Daömey and Wasted Paris, and DNVB (Digital Native Vertical Brands) offering products designed especially for the occasion.

This first season will mainly showcase independent brands from Paris and surrounding regions, but the event organizer intends to attract more established brands in future editions.
 
""This year, many brands didn't have the opportunity to play the exclusivity game. But we are already in contact with brands that can come in and do product 'drops' or create an experience. It's a natural evolution. Brands think B2B and B2C. We must provide them with these platforms that allow them to connect with this audience of influencers. One of the central themes of the founders of Who's Next was to provide a space for street-culture to emerge. DRP is part of this continuity.”Dropville, the event's counterpart in the metaverseThe event's unique trait is that it will also be held in the metaverse. Dropville was created as an online counterpart to the physical event, but will be available year-round. The 2D universe allows visitors to meet and participate in egg hunts that give access to product drops. The brands present in the physical DRP event will also be online and will give the community the opportunity to win products in the metaverse.""It's a city you can explore in ten minutes,"" explained Boris Vey, partnership manager at WSN Développement. ""There you will find the Red Star stadium, a nightclub, and a museum where there will be exhibitions. There will be games, egg hunts… it's gamification. Through NFTs, there will be the possibility to have access to physical events, including 100 tickets to Sneakerness.""

With DRP, which combines the physical and digital spheres, WSN Développement aims to offer brands an interface to interact with the communities they intend to reach.

The event will be accessible from 15 euros per day, with priority passes set at 50 euros for people who wish to be the first to enter on the morning of June 23. The organizer expects about 15,000 people to attend the event. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 6, 2022","The house of Jean Paul Gaultier has unveiled an uber insider collab with hipster stylist Lotta Volkova, culled from the house’s archive. It goes on sale today.  
Volkova’s goal: to celebrate Gaultier essentials, such as corseted lingerie, conical breasts, deconstructed tailoring, trompe-l'oeil prints, baby-doll dresses and lingerie-inspired mesh. 
 
The results begin retailing this Friday online and in selected international boutiques.A novel look at Jean-Paul’s canon which Volkova approaches with a stylist eye. Lotta soared to fame a little more than a half decade ago by styling the first shows in Demna Gvasalia (now just Demna) for his cult label Vetements.
 
In this new capsule she re-edits Gaultier’s iconic 1984 velvet cone dress (first worn by man-muse Tanel Bedrossiantz in 1992) into a mini dress and top, redefining the Gaultier look for today. 
 
While a tennis-striped suit is deconstructed with inserts resembling harnesses inspired by SM and fetishism.“Discovering Jean Paul Gaultier and Antoine De Caunes presenting their show Eurotrash was one of the first fashion memories for me. What struck me was the extreme eccentricity, the uncompromising vision, the spirit and the endless festive celebration of fashion, culture, music and underground cultures that all formed an extraordinary world by Jean-Paul Gaultier. It was an incredible honor to be able to discover the archives, bordering on obsession and fetishism – to have the chance to reimagine the iconic collections of Jean Paul Gaultier in the context of 2022 by reintroducing them into a contemporary wardrobe,” said Volkova in a release.
 
Another element included into the capsule is the jacquard couture Naked Dress from Fall/Winter 2004-2005, now available in an easy-to-wear jersey. 
In terms of accessories, Volkova’s eight-heel pumps take up the famed ""Mille-Pattes"" pumps from the Spring/Summer 1993 ""Les Classiques Gaultier revisités"" collection.

"May 4, 2022","Even more than Blake Lively, Kylie Jenner or Kim Kardashian, it was the corset that stole the show on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for this year's Met Gala. The underwear item -- which made a comeback to our wardrobes just over a year ago -- clearly went down a storm with viewers, as online search interest soared after the ceremony.Many believed that the corset would quickly be relegated to the ranks of the micro-trend -- a fleeting moment in fashion. However, it now seems to be one of the most coveted pieces of the womenswear wardrobe. And this has been going on for over a year now. The Met Gala, held Monday in New York, did nothing to change the game -- quite the contrary, in fact. The underwear item, which dates back to the Spanish court, when it was used to straighten the female torso, even turned out to be the star of the event, with searches jumping on several platforms in the wake of the prestigious ceremony.

Many celebrities held their breath on the red carpet of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, each following the next in spectacularly voluminous gowns matched with some kind of corset. There was Billie Eilish in a corseted satin Gucci gown, Gigi Hadid in a Versace corset jumpsuit topped with an oversized coat, Precious Lee in a sheer bodycon dress with a corset by Altuzarra, and Bella Hadid sporting an armor-like corset over lace leggings and a chiffon skirt. This is perhaps not surprising considering that the theme of the evening was ""Gilded Glamour,"" referencing the American golden age of the late 19th century. But the effect didn't take long to trickle down into the real world, since a few hours after the ceremony, internet users were frantically taking to their keyboards in search of the model that would make them look just as glamorous as their favorite stars.cThe global fashion search engine, Stylight today reports that clicks for corsets recorded an 87% increase just a few hours after the Met Gala, reflecting a seemingly unwavering craze for a garment that was the subject of much criticism just a few decades ago. These figures appear to be confirmed by data from the platform, Love the Sales, reported by Women's Wear Daily (WWD), raising the corset to the top of the most popular pieces in the wake of the ceremony (+107% in searches), far ahead of sequin dresses (+66%).

It was at the end of 2020 that the corset made its big comeback to the fashion scene, buoyed by the series ""Bridgerton,"" and giving rise to one of the key trends of 2021: regencycore. But this underwear item -- which has become a garment in its own right -- has since been refreshed and modernized in the form of crop-tops, jumpsuits and various glamorous tops. On TikTok, the #corset hashtag counts 3.5 billion views, showing young people's keen interest in this clothing item, which we (definitely) haven't seen the last of.

"Apr 30, 2022","One didn't needn't ponder long why Thom Browne chose to show his Fall 2022 collection—months after other designers called it a wrap on their cold-weather collections—on the last Friday in April upon glancing at the calendar.

The designer chose a strategic place to kick off the weekend leading up to the first Monday in May, on which the Met Gala takes place annually. Considering the theme of this year's event, 'In America: An Anthology of Fashion,' and the classic preppy tropes Mr. Browne reimagines so well, one wonders if he wasn't asked to show at that time by the fete's grand dame Anna Wintour.To further the theory, in the fantasy-filled runway romp, the designer, via an announcer, beckoned those in the room to consider why they came to the Big Apple, America's largest and busiest city, and who they wanted to be there. In this way, the designer set up the show to examine different ""types"" but did so in the context of his wool flannel and menswear haberdashery bits and playful animal themes, focusing on the beloved teddy bear.
 
The stage at the Javits Center's vast pavilion at the farm space was set with rows of grey-suited teddy bears sitting on miniature chairs. This scene had audience members initially wondering if it represented Oz or Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall thanks to its English schoolboy undertones. The designer called the 500 bears ""chairbears"" (presumably a play on Care Bears) in a release. The larger-than-life chair at the front was to host the grand poobah teddy bear, who served as master of ceremony and wore teddy fur gloves and boots and a gigantic top hat with a toy bear face.The way they waved at the crowd conjured visions of FAO Schwarz live toy soldiers that greeted guests, or a bear-themed Macy's Day Parade also came to mind. The real inspiration was the island of misfit toys scene from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer animated film.The models who opened the show carried Thom Browne's bags elongated into a massive bag that required several models to carry it, each wearing Stephen Jones masterful top hat creations. Perhaps that alluded to how New Yorkers carry each other in times of dire need, say the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
The models who appeared in the first portion of the show imagined a unisex New Yorker with skirts for all. They were mixed and matched in Browne's woolen tweeds and checks, layered as pants under skirts, shirts, and jackets, and threw in a mélange of men's tie silks in various colors to add to the zany textile combos.

Even the massive platform lace-up shoes came in mixed pairs. Browne seemed to embrace a car-coat silhouette in lieu of the shrunken blazer he is famous for. As silhouettes shift to oversize, the designer may soon find himself at a philosophical design crossroads.

As exaggerated as the first group was, it was the second group where the designer let his design inhibition rip. A voice over the soundtracked introduced the ""toys,"" which was where the fantastical looks came to life as the music went from melancholic to a retro festive vibe. A massive crinoline look opened, creating a triangle shape on the model about 10 feet in diameter.Next, a lobster claw and tail look; after that, a ball-shaped sweater resembling a softball. Wait, was that a slinky-inspired look? The accessories drove the point home with amusing alphabet block shoes and bags, a Hector dog jack in the box, a toy truck bag, and even a shape-discovery maze on one bag handle. The non-conventional makeup looks in different color shapes, recall the plastic sticker game Colorforms. The toys allowed Brown to explore the notion of exaggeration, whether it was bulbous shapes on a dress, gigantic cable knits, whipstitches, or shirt sleeves that practically swept the floor.
 
For the finale, as typical in a Thom Browne show, models came out in pairs, stopped along the runway, then turned and faced each other as the announcer invited them to find their true selves. It was a poignant yet slightly icky moment, maybe meant to help some relive those awkward moments of self-discovery.

Or to imagine New Yorkers, under normal circumstances turning to a stranger and start chatting them up. Just then, the show's master of ceremonies started to lip-sync Kelly Clarkson's A Moment Like This, having a drag moment that teetered on self-indulgent as he escorted the smiling designer to take a well-deserved bow.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 29, 2022","With verses from love poems and flowing calligraphy, Jordan-based fashion designer Hana Sadiq stitches a testament to the beauty of Arab women.In a career spanning decades, Iraqi-born Sadiq has shown her creations worldwide and dressed the stars, but she remains rooted in the traditions of her homeland.

The artistic handwriting of Arabic script dominates her embroidered modern designs, with poetry or letters scattered in bright colours.She uses various calligraphic styles, from the elaborate Diwani to the curving Thuluth, and features on some of her outfits the lines of renowned Arab poets including Mahmoud Darwish and Nizar Qabbani.

""Arabic calligraphy is the most beautiful,"" says Sadiq, 72, showing off her love of jewellery with strings of beads around her neck, dangling earrings, and unusual stone rings.

At her home workshop in downtown Amman, Sadiq notes that the earliest writing was born several millennia before Christ in what is now Iraq, arguing that it was a place ""without which all the other civilisations would not have existed"".

Sadiq has split her time between Amman and Paris since 1982, having both French and Jordanian nationality as well as Iraqi citizenship.

- 'How beautiful she is' -

She has exhibited from Europe to the United States as well as the Middle East, returning home with an extensive collection of antique silver ornaments, along with thousands of pieces of Arab textiles and costumes.

Her kaftans, traditional robes, feature bright and stunning colours. They reflect the influence of her grandmother who wore a traditional Iraqi ""Hashemite dress"" and walked ""elegantly like a peacock"".

The folk outfit is made of very thin fabric with wide sleeves and transparent sides, decorated with beautiful floral ornaments, golden or silver, on a black base. It was the favourite of Iraqi women in the 1950s and 60s.

Sadiq traces her interest in fashion to her childhood, when she would visit her grandfather's textile shop in Baghdad.

She went on to design for celebrities and royals, including Jordan's Queen Rania and Queen Noor. But whoever the client, her work has been guided by pride in the Arab woman's femininity.

Unlike more revealing Western fashion, her designs envelope the woman's body, ""but it shows high femininity,"" says Sadiq, who is also the author of a book, ""Arab Costumes and Jewelry, a Legacy without Borders"".

She argues that Western clothes are not the best fit for the bodies of Arab women but have spread to the region anyway. ""Unfortunately this is the result of globalisation,"" she says.

""What matters to me, in all my work, is that the woman remains female and that a man is attracted to her as a female,"" she adds. ""Which means when a woman passes in front of him, he must notice and see how beautiful she is.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Apr 29, 2022","The first physical show staged for Diesel by designer Glenn Martens, held in Milan on February 23, will be replicated in Japan featuring the same setting made with giant inflatable dolls. The Italian jeans label owned by the OTB group has in fact scheduled a show in Tokyo on June 9 to present its Fall/Winter 2022-23 women’s and men’s collections, with the addition of a number of new looks, as Diesel told FashionNetwork.com.
 Diesel has confirmed the announcement made by Glenn Martens to the Italian media, without disclosing anything further about the event’s venue.

It simply added that it will coincidentally open a pop-up store in Ginza, the Japanese capital's luxury shopping district, launching the Diesel Studio project. The latter is “an interactive project that explores and tells the story of Tokyo’s mixed cultures through a venue hosting events and initiatives,” said Diesel. Beyond this specifically targeted Tokyo initiative, choosing Japan for the next show seems fully logical and consistent with the strategy of Renzo Rosso’s group. Japan is one of the most important markets for OTB, accounting for 25% of the group’s revenue, which in 2021 reached €1.53 billion. Above all, it is a key market for Diesel, which operates more than 100 directly managed monobrand stores in the country.
 
Moreover, after two years marked by the pandemic, when Japan was virtually closed to international visitors and notably Chinese tourists, the country has regained momentum earlier this year, its luxury sector in particular. Hence the importance for Diesel of making its presence felt on the Japanese market as it gets back on the growth track.

"Apr 28, 2022","Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week continued to bid on a good number of international brands to walk down its catwalks after its first day saw the presentations of renowned international firms such as Dutch brand Viktor&Rolf and American brand Marchesa’s collaboration with Pronovias. With the aim of positioning itself as a key event in the international bridal fashion scene, the event featured the Belgian brands Marylise and Rembo Fashion Group, Bulgarian brand Julia Kontogruni and Ukrainian label Katy Corso.From Marylise and Rembo Fashion Group’s craftsmanship to Julia Kontogruni’s voluminous silhouettesRembo Fashion Group, the Belgian family business founded in 1926 as a millinery shop specializes today in bridalwear and counts on its three bridal brands produced in Portugal: Marylise, Rembo Styling, and since 2020, Carta Branca. They all presented a joint fashion show on April 21 on the Barcelona catwalk under the slogan ‘Entre nós’. The company currently managed by the fourth generation of the family boasts 629 stores in 20 different countries. The three brands, utilizing European materials and sustainable fabrics, are characterized by a luxurious yet comfortable boho style. Marylise stood out for the simplicity of its designs, with comfortable dresses made with an abundance of lace and voluminous sleeves; while Rembo Styling presented more audacious designs, featuring open backs and more laidback looks. The label counted on Chilean designer Paula Matthei and her creative vision for its new collection. 

With the addition of Carta Branca’s more avant-garde and refined aesthetic to its portfolio, the group aims to expand into international markets such as the United States or China. The brand’s new collection designed by Claudia Llagostera and Géraldine Simonnet stands out for its use of pure silk, free of lace or other fabrics. The brand is exclusively available at select stores for the moment. Meanwhile, the Bulgarian firm founded in 2002 by designer Julia Kontogruni distinguished itself with its handmade pieces. Her new collection unveiled last Friday, April 22, and inspired by opulence and Victorian style featured voluminous dresses, tight corsets with underwire, plenty of lace and Swarovski crystals.Katy Corso’s avant-garde designs during wartimeKaty Corso was the first Ukrainian brand to participate in the Barcelona bridal event during turbulent times marked by the Russian invasion in her home country. For her latest collection, the designer revisited her avant-garde spirit with a wide plethora of dresses.

"Apr 28, 2022","The New School is set to host the 73rd annual Parsons Benefit on May 23, where it will honor visionary figures in fashion, among other creatives including Tory Burch the executive chairman and chief creative officer of Tory Burch and Lauren Santo Domingo, co-founder and chief brand officer of Moda Operandi.This year’s honorees, which also include Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation and visual artist Kehinde Wiley, are being celebrated for their numerous contributions to design, retail, entrepreneurship, the arts, philanthropy, and social justice. They are also recognized for their long-standing commitment to supporting and creating opportunities for future generations of artists and designers, and creatives.

“Parsons is proud to be honoring this entrepreneurial and diverse group of leaders who are all visionaries in their respective industries and fields, and for their deep commitment to the values that guide Parsons in everything we do,” said Rachel Schreiber, executive dean of The New School’s Parsons School of Design. “Parsons was founded upon the idea that design, art, and business can change the world, and these exceptional honorees are reimagining the creative and commercial landscape in unique ways that will positively impact a range of disciplines for years to come.”
 
Parsons hosts the Parsons Benefit each year to present and empower the next generation of fashion designers, while raising funds for student scholarships. Burch and Santo Domingo join an esteemed list of past honorees including Donna Karan, Jason Wu, Vera Wang, and more.

"Apr 27, 2022","If there was one fashion sector in which a significant upturn was expected after the impact of the pandemic, it was bridalwear. Faced with the restrictions of the last two years which limited or postponed weddings, 2022 will be a record year for the bridal industry, according to the Wedding Report’s forecasts.

Reaching the highest figures since 1984, 2.47 million weddings are expected to be held this year (compared to 1.93 and 1.27 million ceremonies recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively), with their average spending rising to $24,300 (about 22,700 euros). The string of ceremonies will remain above $2 million per year, at least until 2025, and come as a treat for companies and brands in the sector, forced by the Covid-19 pandemic to spend two financial years practically in the black. The trade fair and fashion shows of Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week took over from New York Bridal Fashion Week, held in the Big Apple earlier this month, and returned to a physical format, between April 20 and 24, aiming to reaffirm its role as Europe’s bridal fashion capital.  ""We are very pleased with this return after two years of pandemic life. The balance is very positive for the 34 shows. The 320 brands present at the fair have been selling and the atmosphere is very positive"", said the event's director, Estermaria Laurucia, to FashionNetwork.com, underlining ""the optimism that is felt, the desire to meet again and the gratitude of the participants to be able to count on a leading event in Europe to revive the industry.”

According to data collected by the event organized by Feria de Barcelona with the support of the Departament d'Empresa i Treball de la Generalitat de Catalunya, it had already registered a total of 18,600 participants, 65% from abroad, as well as 1,170 Spanish and international buyers invited by the organization just hours before it closed. The organizer highlighted the European, Latin American, Chinese and American markets among the most important for the sector. ""Barcelona is the 'place to be' in this industry. We stand by the fact that bridal fashion is fashion for all intents and purposes,"" she added.Faced with the need to reinvigorate the bridal industry after several postponements and hybrid presentations during the pandemic, the event organized a special gala with its loyal brands last October, but its return to the traditional catwalk and trade show format was postponed until its usual date in April. ""We haven’t completely forgotten the pandemic, but no one is willing to stop again,"" she said of the ""coexistence with Covid-19."" Moreover, the start of the event coincided with the first day exempt from mandatory masks indoors, acting as a further boost of optimism among attendees.""The line between online and offline is becoming increasingly blurred and bridal fashion is forced to move towards digital and connected initiatives. But this part does not have to replicate the physical experience, just as each proposal has to have its own space,"" Laruccia explained about the new hybrid event format, with which the BBFW Digital Experience platform, which already has over 40,000 views, will continue to run until June 20.A new concept tailored for brides""The physical fair cannot be replaced, especially from a professional standpoint, but the online allows the connection time to be extended. It's very useful in the bridal industry, where all companies are now more cautious and have extended their buying times,"" she explained, adding that ""rethinking the concept"" also makes it possible to reach the end consumer directly, something that wasn’t possible up until now.

""We are transitioning from a BtoB industry to a BtoBtoC industry. Ultimately, it is the brides who are reviving this industry and we have to target them. For a while, marriage was seen as old-fashioned. This perception has shifted, ceremonies have opened up to young people again and new phenomena are being experienced,"" she said, mentioning trends such as double dresses or second weddings.

For several editions now, a key driver in broadening horizons and gaining media traction has been inviting internationally renowned companies to showcase. In this edition, two highlights paraded during the week's opening day, presenting the collaboration between American firm Marchesa and the Dutch brand Viktor&Rolf, who paraded their bridal line for the first time, accompanied by an anthology of wedding dresses from their haute couture collections.International recognition was also guaranteed by the long-awaited Atelier Pronovias fashion show, held in the festive Pabellón de Italia, a few meters away from the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc. The collection inspired by Versailles and designed by Alessandra Rinaudo featured 44 dresses handmade in Spain with French and Italian fabrics and designed for women of different ages and body types, which were characterized by their detachable sleeves, ruffled capes, lace bodices, long trains, and deep necklines. The most photographed look was the one entrusted to add the final touch to the show, worn by the iconic Spanish model of the 90s Esther Cañadas, who returned to the catwalk at the age of 45. The design was also part of the three limited edition NFTs accompanying the collection.Internationalization as an objectiveThis was not the only collection presented by the Pronovias Group, owned by BC Partners since 2017, which also organized the Nicole Milano fashion show. The brand, which joined Pronovias in the group's brand portfolio five years ago, opted for a romantic collection inspired by art created by its artistic director Nicole Cavallo.

Another leading Spanish company, Rosa Clará, presented its couture 2023 collection that featured refined lines and elegant finishes, where there was no shortage of midi dresses and minimalist looks in stretch crepe or with adjustable sleeves. With 27 years of experience and an international presence of 4,000 points of sale in 80 countries, the brand was delighted to return to the catwalk claiming to have already exceeded its pre-pandemic turnover figures.The lineup included other Spanish players: Isabel Sanchís’ voluminous silhouettes; Yolancris’ rock-inspired bohemian style; Marco & María de Tenerife’s colors and transparencies; Sophie et Voilà’s architectural lines; and Nicolas Montenegro’s traditional Andalusian embroidery. The renowned Italian tailoring company Carlo Pignatelli and the Spanish Ramon Sanjurjo distinguished themselves with their menswear offering.  

When asked about the event's plans for the future, upcoming guest-stars, and finding a new official sponsor after Swiss Valmont’s departure, Laruccia is not ruling out any possibilities. ""We have our doors open and are evaluating all options. We don't want to limit ourselves to a single concept,"" she concluded. The dates for the next event have already been decided: April 19-23, 2023.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 26, 2022","Saul Nash has won the 2022 International Woolmark Prize. Unveiled at an event in London, he was joined by the two designers behind South Africa’s Mmusomaxwell, who received the Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation. The winners receive A$200,000 and A$100,000, respectively, along with “ongoing support from the industry and Woolmark Prize retail partners”.

London-based Nash was praised for his “modern use of Merino wool, bridging a gap between active solutions and more formal requirements”. “Everyone did a great job and could have been a winner,” said judging panel member and Burberry creative chief Riccardo Tisci. “But what Saul did, coming from a ballet background to replace Lycra with wool was really incredible.” 

The collection “exposed Nash to the benefits of Merino wool in activewear, allowing him to develop materials which have enhanced the quality of his designs without compromising their technical DNA”.

His modern interpretation of knitwear focused on minimising waste, and emphasising movement and performance.

Nash said winning the prize was “the cherry on top for everything Woolmark has done for me”.

Meanwhile, judge Carine Roitfeld said Karl Lagerfeld prize-winners Maxwell Boko and Mmuso Potsane of Mmusomaxwell had created designs of which the late designer would have approved. 

Their winning collection was committed to reducing its environmental impact and upskilling traditional craftsmanship with an artisanal approach. The jury praised the design duo for “passion, courage and [being] committed to introducing a new skillset to South African manufacturers”.

Woolmark also presented the Supply Chain Award celebrating an outstanding contribution by a trade partner, with Netherlands-based Knitwear Lab winning. The research and knowledge hub for innovative, design-driven and sustainable knitwear solutions, was recognised for its “contribution to the International Woolmark Prize and for giving access to technology and R&D in flat-bed knitting to emerging brands in a way that is specific to their needs”.It developed 100% Merino wool fabrics with Saul Nash, such as a compression wool hybrid jersey/airtex mesh knit and a double-faced jersey with integrated mesh holes — offering high stretch, strength and breathability. 

As well as Tisci and Roitfled, the jury also included Edward Enninful, Naomi Campbell, Pieter Mulier, and Sinéad Burke.

“The International Woolmark Prize is the jewel in our crown,” said The Woolmark Company MD John Roberts. “It connects our Australian woolgrowers with the global fashion and textiles industry and in turn highlights the beauty, versatility, and modernity of Australian wool. We're proud of the relationships fostered between our seven finalists, prestigious judging panel and supply chain network who have mentored these designers on their Woolmark Prize journey and hope these connections continue in the future.” 

2022’s finalists also included France’s Egonlab, Australia’s Jordan Dalah, UK-based Ahluwalia, Peter Do of the USA, and China’s Rui.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 25, 2022","Eleven years after the last exhibition about Alexander McQueen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, a new event dedicated to the English designer started last Sunday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the Resnick Pavilion.""Mind, Mythos, Muse,"" the first McQueen exhibition on the West Coast of the United States, interprets the designer’s work through nearly 200 objects connected with LACMA’s paintings, sculptures, prints, costume and textiles, and photographs that inspired him, making use of the same curatorial principles as at the recent “Yves Saint Laurent aux musées” exhibition in Paris.
 
The exhibition also highlights a substantial gift from Los-Angeles based collector Regina J.Drucker that has greatly enhanced LACMA’s collection of works by McQueen, which is the largest held by a public institution in North America.The exhibition is organized into four thematic sections: Mythos, Fashioned Narratives, Technique and Innovation and Evolution and Existence, and is showing some of the rarest treasures of McQueen’s collections such as the womenswear ensemble with ruff and gold beading from The Widows of Culloden collection, Fall-Winter 2006-2007, that echoes the lace collar and scrolling metallic-thread embroidery in Frans Pourbus II’s Portrait of Louis XIII, King of France as a boy (1616). Similarly, another look from “The Dance of the Twisted Bull” collection Spring-Summer 2002 is placed opposite the work of the 18th century Francisco Goya evoking the themes of Spanish flamenco and the Spanish bullfight. And the dress from the Scanners collection, Fall-Winter 2003-2004, is presented beside the 17th century Tibetan trunk which has inspired McQueen.
 
“This is not only the first McQueen show on the West Coast, but also the first to display objects that link his work to specific moments in art history from which he drew inspiration,” said Clarissa M.Esguerra, associate curator of Costume and Textiles.
 
The McQueen exhibition at LACMA will run until October 9.

"Apr 22, 2022","Not even the rain was able to stop the bright and awaited return of Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week (BBFW). Forced to change plans at the last moment, relocating its inaugural day’s star show in face of forecasted rain showers and wind, the bridal fashion event demonstrated the flexibility and adaptability acquired during the pandemic to hold a haute couture reunion.

The day's agenda included fashion shows of renowned Spanish brands Isabel Sanchís, Yolancris and Jesús Peiró; the presentation of the second collaboration between the American brand Marchesa and the bridalwear giant Pronovias and a show from the 2022 edition's special guest and protagonist of Barcelona Bridal Night, the Dutch haute couture label, Viktor&Rolf.Initially organized at the Xavier Corberó Center for Research and Artistic Activities, Viktor&Rolf's bridal collection was forced to change venue just 24 hours before its first show. On Wednesday night, it was staged instead at the Fira de Barcelona's Montjuïc venue that will host BBFW shows until April 23, with the participation of renowned brands such as Pronovias and Rosa Clará.

""We are thrilled to be able to parade in Barcelona, a city that for us is the Paris of bridal fashion,"" designers Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, founders of the Amsterdam-based firm in 1993, explained to FashionNetwork.com, revealing that this first show was meant to take place in 2020, but the pandemic forced them to postpone the date.""In Spain they say that rain brings luck at weddings, so we are confident that the same thing will happen to us,"" joked the creators, who selected a total of 37 pristine white ensembles for this one-off partnership with BBFW.

""We started in 2017 with our Mariage line and this show gave us the great opportunity to present a retrospective anthology of our best designs, those that combine romance and femininity with rigor and purity. A mix of naughty and nice,"" detailed the haute couture week regulars about their runway looks, which featured no shortage of couture dresses and the debut of the Mariage 2023 collection, characterized by fitted bodices, short veils and an abundance of handmade organza flowers.In addition, the brand, which produces its designs in China, took the opportunity to work with a new responsible material derived from plants. And despite having dressed Princess Mabel van Orange-Nassau of the Netherlands at her wedding, the designers stressed that fashion has no limits and that they are open to all types of customers, maintaining an inclusive perspective. ""We are allergic to the word target,"" they joked.

Marchesa's bridal collections landed in Barcelona with what was its first bridal show in Europe in 2019. At the time, the event led by Estermaria Laruccia was still sponsored by Swiss luxury cosmetics brand Valmont, and the American fashion brand created in 2004 kept its two founders: Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig. The latter left the company shortly before the pandemic to ""devote herself to new professional projects.""

During this visit to Barcelona, Marchesa presented its second collection together with the Spanish company Pronovias. ""After Covid-19, our goal was to celebrate love. There are many weddings to be celebrated and we wanted to allow different brides to express their personal style, making room for all women,"" said Chapman, co-founder of Marchesa, about her collaboration with the company founded by Alberto Palatchi in 1922. Chapman enlisted the support of Pronovias' creative director, Alessandra Rinaudo, in creating these 25 light and romantic dresses, which recreated some of Marchesa's iconic designs. ""Working with Pronovias has been a dream. They know I would like to make many dresses, as many as possible. And they opened up the possibility for me to go further than if I did it just with my own brand. We share the same values, the construction is incredible, and we value craftsmanship immensely,"" detailed the creative about her long-term alliance with the Barcelona-based company, which needed numerous Zoom meetings to develop during the pandemic period.

The looks from the collection will be available in a wide range of sizes (from 32 to 62) and at an affordable premium price, starting at $2320 (about 2130 euros), available in Pronovias’ stores. 

Three-decades-old company, Jesús Peiró, was entrusted to inaugurate the event with a show at noon. The collection made 100% in Spain designed by Merche Segarra was inspired by a floral spring to dress its models as nymphs. In the afternoon, Isabel Sanchís, the Valencian company born in 1990, showed her artisanal couture savoir-faire through volumes and silhouettes featuring bows and lace. Modern brides wore from elegant blazers with flared pants, at times paired with shimmering tops; to lace blouses with puffed sleeves or sensual silhouettes such as a tight skirt and black crop top set. Metallic appliqués and feathers completed the bridal collection, which stayed true to the DNA of the brand which usually presents its collections during Paris haute couture week.""Throughout these difficult months, we wanted to show the best facet of our brand, the workmanship and attention to detail, made possible by the company's professional team. A team that loves their job, thereby creating a human connection with our garments,"" said the Valencian company, which during the pandemic, used its workshops to make solidarity face masks.

Yolancris, the Spanish firm founded in 2005 by sisters Yolanda and Cristina Pérez, also took center stage with its 'She' collection. A lineup faithful to the brand's bohemian and rock aesthetic, which merges musical references with a retro style to dress the ""anti-brides"".

The rebellious models paraded to the beat of anthems such as 'Creep' or 'Sweet Child o'Mine', clad in dresses handmade in the company’s Barcelona workshop, combining delicate rhinestone embroidery, lace, transparencies and side cut-outs.

The bridal event will continue over the coming days, hosting a total of 34 fashion shows, including brands and designers such as Nicole Milano, Sophie et Voilà, Cymbelline and Carlo Pignatelli. On the other hand, the trade fair will bring together 300 brands, 74% of which are international hailing from 25 different countries between April 22 and 24.

"Apr 19, 2022","Gone is the boho style that helped make Coachella famous in fashion, replaced by a confident and heightened expression of sensuality. This year, the Californian festival, which kicks off the season, has turned up the heat with sexier-than-ever looks, featuring cut-outs, micro-skirts and micro-shorts, tight jumpsuits and visible g-strings, no less.For its grand return, the Coachella festival will be sure to make a mark. Not content with being considered one of the most coveted music festivals in the world, Coachella is also a veritable life-size fashion show, setting the tone for summer trends. And it seems that the boho style synonymous with the event is now but a distant memory. This year, festival girls have swapped their long flowing dresses, cowgirl hats, and denim shorts for much skimpier and sexier pieces.

Cut-outs flash the fleshA strong trend from this beginning of the year, the cut-out has been all over the Californian desert, seen on tops, bodysuits and dresses, offering a glimpse of the waist, the hips, the chest or the belly, and sometimes all at once. On stage, the American rapper Megan Thee Stallion did not refrain from embracing that particular trend, wearing a silver bodysuit cut out in various places. Meanwhile, the singer Karol G performed in a bodysuit made only of denim belts, accessorized with fishnet pantyhose and thigh-high boots. All of which is a far, distant cry from the typical boho style. In another spirit, the influencer Leonie Hanne stepped out in a jewel dress, also mostly transparent, and covered entirely with crystals.

Unsurprisingly, crop tops were also on the agenda, in sportswear versions for some, braided knits for others, and even cut-out styles (yes, it's possible) for a handful. Doja Cat opted for this version, wearing a sculptural crop top hiding only a tiny area of her chest. She matched this with low-waist jeans, another great trend of the festival.

Again keeping the vibe ultra sexy, tight jumpsuits were on parade, with transparent effects for a guaranteed 'wow' effect. And this time it was Lena Situations who stood out from the crowd. For the first day of the festival, the influencer chose a jumpsuit adorned with fringing.

But the top prize of this first weekend of the festival goes to the visible g-string, which made a comeback in the California desert. Anitta, for example, stepped out in pants revealing this underwear option, which had more or less disappeared from sight after the 2000s. A tour de force of the most daring kind that is likely to inspire more than one follower this summer. The festival continues, April 22 to 24.

"Apr 19, 2022","The Kooples has expanded into contemporary art. The Paris-based premium fashion brand has launched The Kooples Art Prize, an annual competition aimed at promoting emerging artists in the international arts scene. Gaby Sahhar and Kim Farkas were selected out of 12 applicants as winners of this first edition. The artworks produced for the award will be displayed in Paris next fall at the brand's new flagship store on the Champs Elysées. They will also be the centerpieces of an exhibition at the Musée d'art contemporain du Vallée de Marne in summer 2023.

“The flagship store on the Champs-Elysées will be the first to showcase our new creative impetus as a fashion brand, but not only that,” said creative director Capucine Safyurtlu. “While The Kooples' 2022 winter collections will mark a new era for the brand, the dialogue with contemporary art will allow us to tell a story that goes much further in terms of radicality and creativity.""In addition to the in-store and in-museum exposure, the prize money includes €28,000, artists' fees, a research residency at Maison Artagon, and professional support.
 
Sahhar, the French-Palestinian artist living in London, works with ink, paint, video, and installations. He also runs the artist support network LGBTQIA+ Queerdirect. His multi-sensory piece for this award was inspired by the works of Otto Dix, futuristic manga, and video clips.

Farkas lives in Paris, where he graduated from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The French-American artist of Peranakan origin, who founded the Holoholo Books publishing house, presented oblong envelopes adorned with reflections of toxic preciousness for The Kooples Prize. 

Founded in 2008 by the Elicha brothers, The Kooples joined the Swiss group MF Brands in 2019, which entrusted the brand’s management to former director of Etam and founder of Ana Shaf, Marie Schott, in 2021. Her mandate is to write the brand’s second chapter: moving away from the rock identity of the past while cultivating a dose of irreverence. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 14, 2022","Paul Smith has launched an inaugural collaboration and mentorship program via an capsule collection with the happening London-based menswear brand Ahluwalia, founded by Priya Ahluwalia.Supported by the Paul Smith Foundation, and tagged under the &PaulSmith collab division, the program is designed to offer a fresh and authentic approach to creative partnerships with emerging and untapped talent,  in a mentorship programs that nurture next generation designers.

Building on a long-standing friendship between Priya and Paul, the Ahluwalia &Paul Smith collection is an 11-piece limited-edition collection where two distinct creative minds meet.“I had the pleasure of being introduced to Priya through a mutual friend and our shared approach to design was obvious from our first meeting. Her maverick spirit reminded me of myself when I was just starting out. While our styles may appear different at first glance, we’re coming at it from the same place: a real conviction that clothes should be a source of joy. This collaborative collection is proof of that,” said Sir Paul.
 
The collection is a fashionable encounter of each designer's DNA: Smith’s bold check fabrics mixed with Ahluwalia’s seaming and paneling techniques. Collage creations that echoed the bright hues of imagery India and Nigeria, culled from Priya’s personal photo archive.

All mashed up with art from Studio One Records, images by graphic designer Ikko Tanaka and works by multidisciplinary artist Ernesto Cánovas.
 
Channeling sustainability, the collection utilizes surplus fabrics found in the Paul Smith archive, and new sustainable alternatives - 100% organic cotton and yarns, biodegradable Lenzing Ecovero viscose and surplus jersey. Prices vary from a €340 short-sleeve cotton photo patchwork shirt to a €625 jacquard cotton cardigan featuring elephants and rickshaws.

“This collaboration is so special to me as it was born out of friendship and curiosity. A while back, Paul so kindly invited me to come and meet him and learn about how he works, and I was blown away by him and his treasure trove of an office. The collaboration conversation happened naturally, and it has been such a pleasure to work with Paul and the Paul Smith team. They have been so supportive, and I have learnt a great deal from them. The collection is a perfect mix of Paul Smith and Ahluwalia codes,” said Priya.
 
Ahluwalia, an LVMH Prize 2020 finalist, blends her Indian-Nigerian heritage with her London roots, using vintage and surplus clothing often in one-of-a-kind pieces. Her creations retail in the likes of Matches Fashion, Browns, Bergdorf Goodman and Ssense.

"Apr 12, 2022","Levi’s has been inviting UK designers to “reimagine post-consumer denim” as part of the brand’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and innovation.The US denim giant is partnering with the British Council’s Architecture Design Fashion (ADF) programme to “create new opportunities for the UK design sector around the globe, through collaboration and exchange; promoting deeper understanding of ourselves, our world and each other through design”.
 
As part of Levi’s “digital residency” with the British Council’s Making Matters programme, Levi’s and ADF have selected two collectives to collaborate on a body of work “which demonstrates an innovative approach to circular design” using Levi’s denim offcuts.British educational association STORE and Netherlands-based design-lab Envisions were chosen to share their practice and co-develop a physical output for display in Levi’s Haus, London, the brand’s concept store dedicated to circularity, design and heritage.
 
Together, STORE and Envisions have focused their work on three categories: mixing fibres, connecting fabrics and exploring yarns. These areas of research form the basis of a public exhibition (opening April 20 until May 5) in Levi’s Haus, London.
 
It showcases over 75 individual experiments, using techniques such as 3D printing, weaving, braiding and creating new materials such as denim composites, denim fur, and denim paint using indigo dye extracted from a pair of jeans.
 
Dennis Goebel, VP Merchandising Levi’s North Europe, said: “We believe in being a positive force for change for our communities. From intercultural collaboration, to environmental activism, to the sheer innovation and creativity of envisions and STORE, the work we have delivered together may not be a solution to the wider issues of sustainability, but we hope its optimism inspires further conversation and collaboration as we all look forward to a better future.”
 
On the possibilities of post-consumer denim, STORE added: “The material’s former life gives you a lot of clues about what you can make. Every stage of production, from harvesting the cotton plant, weaving the threads to dying the fabric helps to generate ideas. Cotton fibres, cotton threads and cotton fabric are all distinct with special material qualities.”

"Apr 12, 2022","The Woolmark Company is pulling out all the stops to support this year’s International Woolmark Prize with the latest news being a collab with FKA twigs and the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum.It’s all been done to present the final International Woolmark Prize collection looks from Ahluwalia, Egonlab, Jordan Dalah, Mmusomaxwell, Peter Do, Rui and Saul Nash. 

In honour of the seven finalists, FKA twigs has directed and is starring in Playscape, a short film celebrating the art of play. The film was creatively directed by Zak Group with choreography by Juliano Nunes. It also includes an immersive showroom and special partnership with the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum. 

Isamu Noguchi (1904–1988) was one of the 20th century’s most critically acclaimed sculptors. He designed several ‘playscapes’ where the public could directly interact with sculptures in ways typically not possible in a museum. 

FKA twigs was inspired by Noguchi’s vision of play as a creative catalyst, merging influences from fashion, art, dance, and music. 

The film opens with an empty gallery of Noguchi’s play sculptures, which becomes populated by a diverse ensemble cast of characters. In the second part of the film the cast enters an imaginary landscape, where ballet is combined with elements drawn from hip-hop, modernism, contemporary dance and punk aesthetics. 

Guest appearances include creative, activist and model Kai-Isaiah Jamal, DJ and dancer Kiddy Smile, along with DJ and artist Princess Julia. 

It's undeniably an interesting way to convey the creativity that's behind the prize, which will culminate in the winners being announced during a live event in London on April 26.

They were judged by a jury that includes Burberry creative chief Ricardo Tisci, model and businesswoman Naomi Campbell, Byredo founder Ben Gotham, Hermès women’s RTW artistic director Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski, Alaïa’s creative chief Pieter Mulier, Carine Roitfeld and others.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

To show the world that indigenous people can also succeed"" in fashion, he said.Moan is one of 37 models -- women and men -- representing 15 indigenous groups of Brazil to take part in the month-long Intercultural Exhibition of Indigenous Fashion in the Brazilian Amazon's largest city.

For the entire month of April, the catwalk is to host the creations of 29 indigenous designers.

""It's a form of resistance, a way to overcome stereotypes,"" event organizer Reby Ferreira, 27, told AFP.

""Here in Manaus, unfortunately, many people are ashamed or even afraid to recognize that they have indigenous blood. Our goal is for everyone to feel included and to show our culture to everyone through these clothes.""

The designers use natural elements in their creations, including the spearlike teeth of the peccary -- an Amazonian boar -- the red guarana fruit, acai seeds and coconut shells.

The same geometric patterns sported by the models are repeated in the fabrics that envelop them.

""My outfit evokes the (coming-of-age) ritual of the Ticuna girl,"" said Kimpuramana, a 17-year-old model sporting a white dress adorned with black diagonal stripes.

On the runway, a presenter announces the ethnicity of each model and explains the symbolism behind the clothes and accessories they wear.

Saturday's show was hosted at the Rio Negro Palace, an early 20th century building that now serves as a cultural center.

""I feel privileged to have been able to attend such an event in this place. We are generally excluded from such sites. Today I can see my people telling their story through fashion,"" said participant Bianca Mura, 24.

As the models walked down the catwalk to appreciative applause, thousands of indigenous Brazilians gathered in the capital Brasilia some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) away, for an annual mass camping event called Terra Livre (Free Land).

The gathering is both a rally for indigenous rights and a protest against the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who is in favor of opening indigenous reserves -- already hard hit by deforestation -- to mining and farming companies.

"Apr 11, 2022","Dior will stage its next Cruise show in Seville, in southern Spain, while sister LVMH brand Louis Vuitton will unveil its cruise collection in San Diego, in southern California, as major marques start head off to exotic locations this spring. 
Vuitton has chosen the Salk Institute for its May 12 show. While Dior has chosen the iconic Plaza de España, in Seville for its show, scheduled for Jun 16. 
 
As the fashion industry continues its emergence from the pandemic many bold face name brands are on the move. Pucci will show the debut collection of its new creative director Camille Miceli on Capri island on Friday, May 29. Balenciaga plans to unveil its spring 2023 collection in New York on May 21. And Max Mara has chosen Lisbon for its next resort show on June 28. “The ties between Dior and Spain, and more specifically Andalusia, were forged as early as the 1950s, and have been strengthened ever since, with journeys leading to silhouettes bearing evocative names dreamed up by Monsieur Dior and his successors,” Dior said in a release.
 
“For the occasion of the unveiling of the 2023 cruise collection designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the house of Dior continues this inspiring tribute further still, celebrating an unshakeable friendship,” the house added. Dior promised a special event to “showcase the excellence of Andalusian craftsmanship and culture through the creativity of local artists and artisans.”
 
Vuitton’s voyage to the Salk Institute is the latest example of the house’s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière’s fondness for distinguished modern architectural locations. The Salk Institute, located on a cliff top in La Jolla in southern California, is perhaps the most important creation of Louis Khan, the single most influential architect of the International Style. The Estonian-born Kahn was regarded as America’s greatest architect, when he died in 1974.
 
Previous Vuitton shows have been staged in Bob Hope’s space age home in Palm Springs; the Miho Museum in Kyoto and, more recently, in the three-kilometer-long Axe Majeur, east of Paris.

"Apr 8, 2022","The pandemic put the fashion industry's small and medium-sized events to the ultimate test. Limited by security measures, travel restrictions and the withdrawal of sponsors, some opted to delay their dates until they found a more optimal time, while others embraced the rise of digital events as an alternative during turbulent times. There was also a third scenario, incorporated by ModaLisboa from the very beginning, which was to combine the physical format with a digital support platform. This intermediate strategy has been synonymous with a struggle for survival, as was the case for Lisbon fashion week. With the long-awaited return to normality, we take a look at the collections showcased at the event filled with character that managed to weather the storm.""We have fought hard to stay on our feet, staying true to our values. We couldn't be prouder to still be here,"" said the event's international coordinator, Lígia Gonçalves, acknowledging the forcefulness with which the pandemic struck, forcing the event to reduce its size which is now gradually recovering. In its last edition held between March 10 and 13, the fashion event bet on establishing creative partnerships, moving the event to a new location: Factory Lisboa's Hub Criativo do Beato, located on the outskirts of the city. Previously intended to house companies and factories, this location now embarks on a journey in which its industrial architecture becomes a backdrop that will host start-up initiatives from multiple industries, not only fashion.
 Lisbon City Hall's commitment to fashionThe new venue, which brought a good dose of renewal and a cool factor with references to Berlin and London, the event organized in partnership with the Lisbon City Hall managed to showcase 26 collections, physically gathering 10,000 attendees, while its conferences and fashion shows reached 465,000 total views, between streaming, the internet, social networks and ModaLisboa's own app. ""It’s a special moment, a year of recovery from the pandemic in which the physical once again takes center stage in our lives, while the 'meta' transforms them on a daily basis,"" said the mayor of Lisbon, Carlos Moedas, alluding to last edition’s concept which revolved around the ""Metaverse"".
 ""This is the perfect place to host this iconic initiative. It is a space of the future that represents a new vision for Lisbon: a city that finds in its roots the energy of disruption, launching a new generation of creators into a space that harbors the freedom to create, to innovate, to be,"" continued the city's mayor, underlining his support for ""Portuguese talent and the ability to transform fashion into an example of sustainability and responsibility,"" in a speech held on the opening day of the event. Meanwhile, Eduarda Abbondanza, president of the ModaLisboa Association defended her commitment to bring ""continuity, evolution and openness"" to the city. ""We are back, in line with Lisbon's stance, focused on the brilliant intersection of fashion, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, art and culture,"" she said about wanting to create cross-sector synergies.
 
""We have focused on intangible fabrics that unite them: complete freedom of expression, independence, identity, empathy, mutual support. However, we did not know that we would apply them in a context of brutality in Europe,"" they explained, given the complex global issues that have bathed fashion events since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, which occurred in parallel with Milan Fashion Week. In solidarity with the Ukrainian people, ModaLisboa collaborated with Unicef Portugal to fundraise, and in addition, several designers broke their silence during their presentations. Blue and yellow also took over the cover of Vogue Portugal’s latest issue.As is customary at ModaLisboa, the first day of the program offered attendees a series of conferences and talks with industry experts. Presented by Joana Barrios and structured in a ""pitch"" format, it reflected on technology with companies such as Yahoo, Farfetch, Vasquiat, Skinvades and Klarna’s contribution. Sustainability was also discussed together with industry names such as Guess, Pangaia, C.L.A.S.S. and Tintex Textiles.Portuguese brands to be on the lookout forIn addition to the emerging brands introduced during the Sangue Novo competition, which awarded local designers Maria Clara and Filipe Cerejo during this year’s edition; ModaLisboa was once again characterized by innovation and avant-garde collections, such as the one presented by João Magalhães, who opted for a performative presentation inspired by ""Venus and the solitary cloud"". The lineup merged Catholic iconography with the urban environment, and the parade combined videography and dance.
 
The sustainable label Béhen, known for constructing garments from classic Portuguese table linen or various household textiles, added a certain farewell with ""Adeus, hasta ao meu regresso"" (Goodbye, until my return). The collection was tinged with the folklore air of some of its colorful fabrics, short jackets, puffed sleeves, die-cut fabrics or jackets made from traditional sewing techniques of the Azores, as well as fitted waists and several arsenal embroideries.""We are continuing to increase the number of artisans we work with, which is this project’s mission. Fashion is about how we communicate these traditional and artistic techniques to new generations,"" recalled Joana Duarte, the designer behind the firm founded just two years ago. ""Fashion can be a bit overwhelming and we have to put this issue on the table. We need to be transparent about what it means to work in this industry and how difficult it is. I'm still trying to understand the best way to organize how to work with craftsmanship. Hosting fashion shows and presenting twice a year, working with some of our artisanal techniques, is at times a bit too intense,"" she said about the fast-paced industry and her possible ""see you later.""
 
While Duarte was inspired by street dance to create colorful casual sportswear and Buzina charmed away with a collection of Scandinavian flair and voluptuous dresses, Hibu treated the crowd to a casual show of streetwear inspired by the nineties, featuring baggy pants, prints in lavender and green tones as well as vinyl looks. Meanwhile, Filipe Augusto reworked men's tailoring in pastel colors, Ricardo Andrez revamped workwear with intense blue in a collection full of balaclavas and Constança Entrudo organized a presentation inspired by an everyday wardrobe and Adolf Gottlieb’s paintings. The more established designers included Luis Buchinho who mixed minimalist silhouettes with reminiscences of rock star glamour, while Luìs Carvalho showed off his tailoring skills through elegant jacquard and taffeta garments for both men and women.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 8, 2022","Innovation organization Fashion for Good, which brings together groups like Adidas, C&A, Kering and PVH, has picked the seven start-ups it will support as part of the Asia Innovation 2022 programme. The latter was launched in 2020 and has already assisted the development of 28 innovative companies.The seven start-ups were selected at an online and in-person summit held in Mumbai, India, by Fashion for Good and its members. They will participate in a nine-month programme through which they will benefit from know-how assistance and networking help to develop and implement their solutions.
 
The programme participants include An Herbals, Fermentech Labs and Sodhani Biotech from India, and Gaiacel from the USA, which specialise in developing plant-based dyeing solutions, in the pre-treatment of textile yarns and in new technologies for reducing water waste by using organic processes, nanocellulose (a material based on plant extracts and paper) and micro-organisms. The other participants are UKHI Hemp (from India), which carries out R&D work exploring alternative materials such as hemp; Vaayu (from Germany), which works on reducing CO2 impact; and Picvisa (from Spain), which specialises in “artificial vision” for the recycling industry.

"Apr 7, 2022","Tel Aviv, a high-tech capital as well as a beachside city that recalls elements of Miami, Jersey shore and Munich, is caught between two generations as its fashion community works hard to gain recognition on the international scene. 
Half its designers very clearly look to Europe, especially London and Paris, creating sophisticated evening wear and grandiose event clothes. The rest concentrate on the local scene, and riff on American luxury streetwear.
 
Tel Aviv is physically divided too. A beautiful extended district along the coast, with its treasured Bauhaus apartment buildings, built by architects from Germany who imported and subtly tweaked the entre-deux-guerres style. Inland, a couple of miles east, is a booming district of techy cyber buildings, swish apartment towers and finely built museums, theatres and concert halls that recall Lincoln Center. Which in part reflects the rapidly changing capital, where the early European emigrant style has been replaced by a more casual American sportswear approach.A blend of the two could be seen in a great joint show by students from Shenkar, Israel’s leading design college and the alma mater of Alber Elbaz. Staged inside Hanger 11, the nerve center of the four-day Israel Fashion Week, the audience of 800 treated the show like a triumph. Scores of models did vogueing duets, and then posed along the catwalk, as some 15 young designers danced along the runway after the display of cyber punk dandies, deconstruction fantasy; goth rebellion; and bedraggled survivor chic.
 
The applause was deafening. And rightly so, because quite frankly this show was just as creative as the February graduate show in London of students at Central St Martins, widely regarded as the finest fashion college on the planet.
 
However, in Israel, the division is in style is not always generational lines, as two young emerging designers showed on Monday.
 
Rotem: Wuthering Heights in HaifaRotem by Rotem Shaul was a display of historicist fashion, where cool governesses met prairie school teachers. Shaul can drape with the best of them, and his ruffle calico gowns and gothic shirts were pretty divine.  He is also an accomplished tailor, whose blazers and jackets had real grace. For grander moments where a lady needs a little arty edge, Rotem is an ideal destination.
 
Genish: You shall not be silencedThe source of Aharon Genish’s inspiration is very dark: child abuse in ultra-Orthodox families, like the one in which he grew up. But the result is clothes of considerable taste, ruffled and rippling gowns and nightdresses; finished  with ties, fabric shards and immense bows. Ceremonial chic rouched and gathered with great aplomb, as an individual designer responded to personal suffering with grace. And in case you didn't get the message, the soundtrack was Leonard Cohen singing You Want It Darker.
 
Kesh: Car crash beachwear

A classic Alfa Romeo 1750 salon car on the catwalk, after a fender-bender or two, set the stage for Kesh, a pop-orientated seaside collection that managed to have a few moments.  This Tel Aviv-based brand was founded in 2018 by Keshet Shapiro, an Israeli South African, though manufactured in Latvia. Shapiro’s obsession with extreme sports and hip hop led to dessert impressionist print tops for guys and mini dresses for gals; logo deep-pocket shorts and pop monster image shirts. Like many Israeli brands, Kesh has an easy-to-use e-commerce business.
 
Though the most comfortable T-shirts to wear in Israel came from Torso, a pure online e-commerce player whose locally manufactured organic cotton feel as comfortable as air.
 
Weksler: Refugees from a bankrupt nightclub

Everything upside down and full of holes at Weksler, whose cast looked like they had just made it out of a bombed-out nightclub. Dudes wearing pullovers as underwear; or gals in T-shirt dresses with prints of hand grenades.  All stitched together in shards of contrasting fabrics.  The guys wearing sewn-up patchwork face masks, as if The Thing out of Pulp Fiction had got a pass to go to a rave party.
 
In a word, if you are looking for a nice neat suit to wear to your nephew’s bar mitzvah, Israel Fashion Week is not the right destination.
 
What you can get are brash and bold new visions, especially at Shenkar. Located inland a few miles, the college is a ramshackle group buildings, though blessed with a high-tech interior.
 
At its center, one finds the Michal and Avraham Kadar Medialab, an advanced experimental fashion research center, with state of the art technology. The ingenious award-winning retro-fit architecture was designed by Geotectura,  building the media lab almost suspended within a 90-year-old building. Students get to experiment with hyper modern 3D digital printers from Stratus, the Israeli firm that leads the industry. A recent collaboration with MIT also launched with a games incubator for students of both schools.  
Michal Kadar, a graduate of Shenkar, also happens to be a brilliant jewelry designer. Her cool modernist designs and flexible fine jewelry for her brand Cadar are inspired by Levantine flora and plants and retail in Bergdorf Goodman.
 
Shenkar students can also avail of high-performance printing courtesy of Kornit, the fashion season’s main sponsor, whose advanced machines have won the techy printer maker over 1,300 international clients. That ability to customize prints was well in evidence in the Shenkar student show.  
Those who look to Paris showed sculpted crepe pantsuits with indented ribs; oversized gala evening trench-coats overprinted with abstract peonies. Other students referenced Bedouin culture, with dessert hoods and shrouds worn with beachcomber jeans. Some created Mark Rothko-hued jungle prints seen in safari shorts, T-shirts and dusters. There was even a Yamamoto-worthy revamp of the classic Hasidic suit, but made with dhoti pants and reinforced sleeves.
 
A rival contrasting trend riffed on Asian avant-garde or Anglo-Saxon ideas. Like a martyr gal whose leather torso-shaped corset and back extensions recalled Craig Green; or a patchwork grandfather striped djellaba/shirts. There was also a hyper-deconstructed assemblage of chopped up pleated kilt topped by a double jacket on one side and a blood red tunic on the other – Sacai for the Levantine.
 
Since Elbaz’ tragic death from Covid last spring, there has been an unspoken search for a new talent to champion Israeli fashion. Shenkar is inevitably where most people believe he or she will emerge. Though whether it will be another Alber, or perhaps an Israeli version of Virgil Abloh remains to be seen.

And the first drop is the Reebok Smiley Classic Leather Pump 50th.

The Classic is one of Reebok’s best-known silhouettes and features its Pump technology. The two companies have worked with graffiti artist Mr André, who created a graffiti piece that was printed on top of premium leather.The graffiti leather panel is also “covered with a special white peel-off paint to disguise the shoe, giving it the appearance of a typical Classic Leather with Smiley accents – including a branded Pump component, spray-painted logo on the tongue and tonal Smiley logo on the back of the shoe”. 

And the point of that? Over time the white paint will “crack and peel off to reveal Mr André’s bold, colourful print with multiple 50th anniversary spray-painted Smiley logos to emphasise the happiness that is always within, waiting to come through”.

It launches with unisex sizing starting on April 15 with other collaborations being revealed in the next few months.

The Smiley Company is one of the world's top global licensing enterprises and its icon can be found not just on clothing and accessories but on homewares, and even food and beverages.

"Apr 5, 2022","The Marseille-based institution, Maison Mode Méditerranée (MMM), founded by Maryline Bellieud-Vigouroux in 1998 and transformed into an endowment fund in June 2020, announced its six winners for the 2022-23 year. The competition attracted over 120 applicants from 15 different countries in the Mediterranean and French-speaking Africa, as stated by the institution, which awarded its grand prize to French designer Louis-Gabriel Nouchi.The six scholarships worth a total amount of 120,000 euros were awarded in four different categories: “Global Fashion Brand” for brands that wish to evolve their development, “Craft & Care” for brands that aspire to create and promote local and ethical know-how, “Heritage & Give-back” intended to accompany a project of learning and transmission of fashion, and finally, “Scientific Research” aimed at supporting the new generation of doctoral students in fashion studies. These are complemented by two partner grants: the Tajima Fashion Tech Prize and the Fragonard Fashion, Heritage and Modernity Prize.  

Louis-Gabriel Nouchi, winner of OpenMyMed 2018 (the competition formerly organized by MMM), won this year’s grand prize (Global Fashion Brand) and  50,000 euros. He additionally received the Fragonard Prize, benefitting from an artist residency in Grasse centered around the technical Provençal know-how, boutis. A 2014 graduate of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Visuels de La Cambre in Brussels, the young French designer launched his menswear brand, LGN, with the support of the Duval real estate group at the end of 2017. Since then, he has launched his own online store, expanded his brand’s universe and opened his first boutique in Paris, where he offers refined sportswear with beautiful cuts, paying close attention to details and materials. The designer, who is also the creative director of Chinese fashion label Joeone, has presented his collections in Paris for several seasons now.

Patchouli Studio, a gender fluid and artisanal brand founded in 2020 by Italian designer Andrea Zanola, was awarded the ""Craft & Care"" scholarship together with €30,000. The Itinérance collaboration between French Alexia Tronel and Caroline Perdrix (winner of MMM in 2016), who is working on a collection inspired by Moroccan cultural heritage, won the ""Heritage & Give-back"" grant (€20,000), while PhD student Pierre-Jean Desemerie, whose thesis focuses on colonial women's clothing in Algeria, received the ""Scientific Research"" scholarship (€20,000).

Last but not least, the ""Tajima Fashion Tech Prize"" was awarded by Japanese embroidery specialist Tajima to Croatian designer Marija Kulusic, who had already won an MMM recognition in 2020, while the Fragonard Prize for accessories was awarded to French designer Emma Bruschi, who distinguished herself in 2019 at the Hyéres Festival by winning Chanel’s 19M Métiers d’art prize.

The jury, composed of Farida Khelfa, Serge Carreira (FHCM), Olivier Saillard, Françoise Montenay (Chanel) and Dominique Jacomet (IFM), among others, has also created two ""Enthusiasm for Fashion"" prizes worth 5,000 euros each for this year to highlight ""the quality and originality of the projects"" of Lebanese designer Cynthia Merhej, founder of the brand Renaissance Renaissance, and Lebanese Vogue Arabia journalist Joe Challita for his fashion archive platform, Lebanese Fashion History.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Apr 5, 2022","As in every edition of ModaLisboa, the Sangue Novo competition for emerging designers brought together Portuguese labels to be on the lookout for that will become the future stars of Lisbon’s avant-garde scene. Held at the Hub Criativo Beato between March 10 and 13, the Portuguese capital city’s fashion week presented a total of five collections from up-and-coming designers, all reinventing classic silhouettes in an innovative manner. Young fashion designer Maria Clara, originating from the island of Madeira, distinguished herself by showcasing a collection inspired by myths and legends from her own land. Escaping a reality in which the fashion industry “pollutes and disposes tons of clothes daily”, her sustainable lineup counted on asymmetrical dresses, embroidered with dozens of safety pins responsible for adding a punk edge to the garments. Having previously formed part of fellow compatriot Constança Entrudo’s design team, Clara’s unique patchwork skirt as well as her beaded, studded, and chain details earned her a double recognition by Sangue Novo.

Winning the popular vote and endowed with 1,500 euros, she received the United Colors of Benetton prize in addition to the ModaLisboa x Tintes Textiles award. This recognition will allow her to do an artistic residency in the company, in which she will develop a capsule collection using her own materials, which implies a financial backing of 2,000 euros.However, Middlesex University graduate in fashion design, Filipe Cerejo, emerged victorious, winning the ModaLisboa x Polimoda award that granted him a master’s degree scholarship at the Italian university and a cash prize of 3,500 euros. His take on the classic trench coat and asymmetrically tailored garments, featuring crisscross elements and one-sleeved jackets worn unconventionally, were enough to seduce the jury chaired by Portuguese fashion industry player, Miguel Flor. Both designers will also receive showroom and communications services from the Showpress agency. Among the other presentations from the event, Abrantes-born designer and model Ivan Hunga Garcia’s work particularly stood out among the rest. What was probably the most disruptive lineup of Sangue Novo’s March edition featured wrapped bodies in several layers of almost transparent, wet-look fabric. Genderless silhouettes were presented in constant dialogue with nature: from skirts meant to resemble sets of leaves or roots, to shawls that seemed to be made out of forest herbs.

Meanwhile, art enthusiast Maria Curado presented her collection entitled ‘Truth or Dare’.

Deconstructed denim overlays and chiffon fabrics took center stage in the lineup characterized by nets and seaweed enveloping the models. Last but not least, the designer who finished his studies at the Soares do Reis art school in Porto, João Viana, upheld the concept of nudity of his brand Veehana.

Bodies were displayed through games of textures and intertwined fabrics, at times structured, in a color palette ranging between grays and nudes, while a bold splash of red painted a pair of semi-transparent pants. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 4, 2022","The Sandbox, a metaverse world that has attracted labels like Gucci and Adidas, has announced it is joining Arianee, a consortium specialised in blockchain solutions for consumer brands. The goal is to enable customers buying a physical product from a label to receive its virtual NFT equivalent.The Arianee consortium has some forty members, among them Paris Fashion Week and the Richemont group, and brands like Mugler, Breitling, Ba&sh, IWC and IBM. Its key service is a blockchain solution that enables brands to create and track an NFT-based virtual identity card for each of their products. The token acts as a certificate of authenticity, and will be ceded by its owner once they sell the product in question.

The Sandbox is the first metaverse player to join Arianee. The aim is to allow consumers who own an NFT for a physical product they bought, like an item of clothing or a fashion accessory, to use it to outfit their customised avatar in the virtual world. More broadly, the goal is to extend the omni-channel purchasing experience beyond physical boundaries and into the metaverse. And to allow labels to stage events reserved exclusively for their customers in The Sandbox. The latter has already attracted names like Adidas Originals, Gucci (with its online space Vault), Carrefour, Leader Price (owned by the Casino group), Warner Music Group, Ubisoft and Atari.“An avatar is the first element that allows most users to enter and interact with the metaverse,” said the managing director of The Sandbox, Sebastien Borget. “To have an individual identity and style is important in the metaverse. Wearing one's favourite label and upgrading one’s virtual avatar are key features that will make our experience even more special,” he added. According to Arianee's CEO Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel, the collaboration will enable The Sandbox visitors to “travel seamlessly between immersive physical and digital worlds.” He added that “we will soon witness the emergence of new user experiences.” The Sandbox has teamed up with Arianee at a time when a number of metaverse worlds are vying for recognition. Users can visit these virtual landscapes with their personal avatars, via a screen or a VR headset. Each metaverse extends over a finite area, and private individuals and businesses can buy land on it to build their own premises or set up a game or event they have designed. This has fuelled a real estate rush on metaverse worlds like Roblox, Cryptovoxels, The Sandbox and Decentraland, which a few days ago staged the first Metaverse Fashion Week. The latter has raised the issue of how this world can be made accessible to a wider public, and of the potential clientèle the virtual fashion world can tap (you can read about the Metaverse Fashion Week here).

Arianee is competing with other protocols, like GoodsID and Aura (the latter developed by the LVMH group), and has not waited for a metaverse leader to emerge. Each metaverse is currently functioning as a separate entity: NFTs of virtual avatar outfits that work in one world do not do so in another, whose graphic quality is also likely to be different. There exist in fact interoperability issues which are making brands prudent in their web 3.0 investments. By facilitating the match between real and virtual products, Arianee is expecting to step up the pace of development, and give The Sandbox a lead on others.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

Ræburn is heavily focused on sustainability and has driven a deeper dive into this area in his time at the company, something Timberland acknowledged in its release announcing his move.In his new role, he’ll join other brand collaborators and will also continue to be active in its Earthkeepers platform that focuses on eco-aware clothing and footwear.

On his LinkedIn page, Ræburn said: “As the world continues to evolve, so do I. Four years ago, I was given the opportunity to join forces with Timberland – a brand I’ve long admired for its strong values, progressive spirit and authenticity in both products and business practices. As Global Creative Director I’ve been so proud of the work we’ve achieved across the brand, and it’s been humbling to work alongside such a talented team to push the boundaries of eco-innovation and product design.

“And now, the adventure continues: I’m thrilled to carry on my work with Timberland in a new role, Collaborator at Large. My key area of focus is where my passion lies, in continuing to champion Earthkeepers by RÆBURN as the pathfinder for the brand; we’ll have a new collection coming soon that’s steeped in progressive design and eco-innovation. We’ve also got amazing new collaborations on the horizon, and some exciting work leading up to Timberland’s 50th anniversary next year.”

Raeburn has had other projects under his belt in recent periods. Back in 2020, he linked up with Stone Island founder Massimo Osti to reinvigorate the Left Hand and ST95 brands that had been acquired by UK-based Left Hand Studios Limited.

The ST95 label was finally relaunched in December 2021 with Ræburn at the helm. It was the brand’s first new collection in over two decades. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 4, 2022","""Tiburón"" (shark) is how Spanish designer Alejandro Gómez Palomo decided to name the fourteenth collection of his global brand, Palomo Spain. The Spring/Summer 2022 collection saw the couturier reinvent the “businessman and preppy” wardrobe through a flawless parade held on Friday, April 1, at Espacio Loom in Madrid. In order to draw a parallel between “the sobriety of a businessman’s lifestyle with an aesthetically rigid structure and the disinhibition they flaunt eccentrically driven by their desire for greatness,” Palomo attempted to dive into the world of executives. This new creative incursion was inspired by cinematic and literary classics such as 'Dress for Success', 'American Psycho', and even 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.   

In Madrid’s financial district (Paseo de la Castellana), lined by the city’s most prestigious business offices, Palomo Spain contemporized the sleek lines and tailored silhouettes of the corporate employee’s attire. Psychedelic prints, a clear nod to the altered realities caused by consuming narcotics, juxtaposed the modest and tailored pieces against the city skyline with skyscrapers at sunset as a backdrop.The garments taking inspiration from the financial world ranged from polo shirts to classic trench coats, as well as knit sweaters that represented the Spanish label’s first foray into knitwear. All the pieces were reinterpreted with the irreverent and satirical spirit that characterizes Palomo’s designs, in pique or dyed fabrics and a gradient color palette. The office uniform was revamped through shirting fabrics featuring faded pinstripes or loud prints created in the designer’s own atelier.  The collection took a bourgeois turn in the form of mink and sable coats, additionally conceived in a light marabou feather version. Sportswear also made an appearance through tracksuits, polo shirts, and athletic jumpsuits suitable for the gym or even the sauna. Meanwhile, a series of customized Levi’s denim garments comprised the more informal assortment. 

""My goal was to liberate men from the conventional corset,"" said the designer, who was among the semi-finalists of the LVMH 2022 Award, in an interview with the EFE agency, explaining that ""men now play a leading role; there are guys whose style attracts more attention than women.""

As for what he hopes to accomplish in the future, Palomo commented that ""the brand is a functioning reality "" and that he has ""super big projects"" yet to be unveiled. It remains to be seen whether his plans also include a return to the Parisian catwalks that have already seen him triumph on several occasions.

"Mar 30, 2022","Paris Fashion Week consolidates its position as the leading industry event in both the real world and on the internat. The return to physical shows at the beginning of the year, attended by many celebrities, including Rihanna, Zendaya and Kim Kardashian, has not caused the fashion week’s online audience to diminish. On the contrary, it has actually caused the number of visitors to soar, according to figures recorded by data analysis specialist Launchmetrics and released by the Federation of Haute Couture and Fashion (FHCM).The Fall/Winter 2022-23 Women’s Fashion Week ran from February 28 to March 8, but the data crunched by Launchmetrics was collected from February 25 to March 16. The number of unique visitors more than doubled this season compared to those recorded in February/March 2021, increasing by 90% from 216,000 to 456,000. The number of page views jumped by 72% to 1.4 million. 

Media Impact Value (MIV) increased by 97% to $260 million dollars compared to the $132 million obtained a year earlier. This is a significantly higher value than the figures earned by other Fashion Weeks, with Milan reaching $171 million, New York $117 million, and London $40 million.Between the Women's Week, Men's Week and Haute Couture Week, the FHCM platform hosted a total of 201 fashion shows and presentations this season, attracting 706,000 unique visitors from January to March. ""The fashion houses, members of the Federation or invitees, showcased their collections to the general public and fashion industry professionals, through livestreams, pre-recorded videos or creative films,"" said the Federation. Their content was broadcasted on the brands’ social media profiles, as well as through a network of broadcasting partners including Google, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and a number of Chinese platforms such as TikTok, Weibo, Tencent Video and WeChat.

Out of the five leading brands ranked in terms of media impact value (MIV), Dior took first place followed by Balenciaga, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Off-White. Dior took the cake once again in the influencer market, with South Korean pop star Jisoo’s Dior-sponsored Instagram post surpassing 5 million likes, resulting in a media impact value of $1.74 million dollars.

Another noteworthy finding by Launchmetrics was the resurgence of traditional media, accounting for more than half (57.5% vs. 30% last season) of the total performance recorded by this latest Paris Fashion Week in terms of MIV, followed by influencers (17.1%), brands' own social media pages (14.7%), celebrities (9%) and other broadcasting partners (1.7%).

"Mar 29, 2022","On March 24-27, the virtual world of Decentraland hosted the first Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW), concrete proof of the growing influence of the virtual fashion market. The event provided a visibility boost for a metaverse domain, Decentraland, that faces a number of virtual competitors, and a fresh opportunity for labels that are absolutely set on taking this new world seriously, jettisoning the scepticism that once hailed the emergence of e-tail. The result was a creative and commercial cocktail that proved refreshing for the industry, despite technology issues and organisational glitches. An event that also raised genuine questions about the potential of virtual fashion.The Etro show at MVFWThe first MVFW truly kicked off on Thursday with the show by Dolce & Gabbana, hosted under an array of laser beams at the UNXD Luxury District, itself inaugurated only a few hours earlier (coordinates -100/-18). A huge, immaculate open space sits right at the heart of the UNXD Luxury District, clearly inspired by Paris’s avenue Montaigne and home to stores by Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Auroboros and Franck Muller. In the centre of this space, multiple avatars showcased virtual fashion collections on a catwalk in the shape of a figure 8.The whole performance was minutely scripted. A little too much perhaps, as some among the hundred or so spectators started messaging each other. “Nothing’s happening over here. Anything at your end?” asked a surprised visitor, one of many. By the time they had a connection again, the show alas was over, a giant countdown dial announcing a long wait for the next event.

The same problem seemed to occur on Friday at the Etro show, and again, though to a lesser degree, during the week-end. It meant that some missed the cloud of pink stars showered on Etro’s show. Not even the most robust fibre broadband and a gaming pc were sometimes enough for a stable connection.Another venue that hosted a number of shows was Kollectif Catwalk (97/-13). A transparent tube in the shape of a loop alongside which many Decentraland denizens were gathered, watching Perry Ellis, Christine Massary, MTA x DressX and 8sian showcase their collections on a futuristic runway. Virtual models stepped along the runway, stopped, pausing in synch three times, and sauntered by again and again. Repetition was a good idea, as it allowed visitors to join the event when already under way, without missing anything.Another very popular venue was the Plein Plaza (-80/-57). The German designer did not disappoint. In the centre of a vast tract of land, a creature not unlike a gastropod periodically opened its macabre maw, from which models climbed out, flaunting otherworldly looks. Otherworldly, but not quite so much for Decentraland. This was one takeaway from the first MVFW: perhaps labels aren't going far enough.Should real-world codes adapt to virtual world?Decentraland’s friendly, welcoming inhabitants stroll around their metaverse sporting the most extravagant outfits: fluorescent neon wings, backlit jumpsuits, robotised parkas and centaur-like bodies. A clear sign that the event, and the major labels it featured, was eagerly awaited. Some of the shows seemed rather tame compared to those who came to watch.

Which raised questions about the metaverse strategy real-world labels ought to adopt: should they conform to their physical collections’ style, like Etro, or adapt it to the creative excesses allowed by the virtual world, like Dolce & Gabbana (at the risk of wandering off on a tangent)? One certainty is that, given the diversity of the looks worn by the audiences, there are plenty of potential customers. What needs to be assessed is the actual size of this market, and the investment it could justify on the part of labels.Besides the shows, MVFW was the opportunity for Selfridges to inaugurate a virtual flagship (63/14), a building with a honeycomb façade inspired by the chain’s Birmingham branch, showcasing Paco Rabanne's virtual creations. On Rarible Street (-44/70), visitors were able to visit the Perry Ellis and PumaxArtisant flagships, alongside pure players like Crypto Couture. Ikks opened its flagship on another street dedicated to fashion, the Portal Fashion District (-86/108), home to some 15 labels, among them Hogan and Tommy Hilfiger.Tommy Hilfiger himself attended MVFW in person. Unfortunately, as some visitors complained on Friday, a mistake in the official calendar's timetable (corrected after the event) scheduled his speech much later than when it actually took place. Fashion weeks seem to be plagued by timetabling issues in the metaverse too. As for the MVFW’s round-table debates, they were on the whole pertinent, but attending them on virtual bench seats facing a screen on one's own screen makes one wonder about the format’s complexity.

Shopping on Decentraland's commercial streets poses issues too. One advantage of physical stores over e-shops is that customers can take a close-up look at clothes. Inside a metaverse store, clothes are only as visible as they are on Decentraland’s internal marketplace. Sooner or later, this will raise questions about the relevance of virtual stores that simply replicate real-world ones, besides the experience itself.Estée Lauder, whose products cannot be easily virtualised, seems to have followed this approach for its Decentraland address (-17/140) at MVFW, featuring a giant night cream bottle floating in the air. Inside, visitors were able to enjoy the Estée Lauder Experience.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 29, 2022","PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger announced on Monday the opening of applications for the fourth edition of the Tommy Hilfiger Fashion Frontier Challenge.

"Mar 25, 2022","The LVMH Prize, the competition for emerging fashion designers launched in 2014, announced on Thursday its eight finalists. Following the semi-final of the LVMH Prize, which took place earlier this month and saw 19 young designers present to the committee of experts of the prize and, for the second time, to the general public, selected eight brands that will compete in the final. This year, the designers who have reached the final of the LVMH Prize come from Canada, Ireland, Japan, Nigeria, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. 

The eight finalists are made up of womenswear brand Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park; womenswear, menswear and genderless collections from Erl by Eli Russell Linnetz; womenswears brand Knwls by Charlotte Knowles and Canada’s Alexandre Arsenault; womenswear brand Róisín Pierce by Róisín Pierce; genderless collections from Ryunosukeokazaki by Ryunosuke Okazaki; and finally menswear collections from S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey Daley, Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James, and Winnie New York by Idris Balogun. “The semi-final, which took place both during a showroom and online, allowed us to discover the work of the shortlisted designers. I would like to applaud their talent and their enthusiasm, and to congratulate all of them. I especially enjoyed interacting with each one and I was won over by their inventiveness, their way of celebrating know-how and crafts, as well as their approach to environmental issues,” said Delphine Arnault.

“I would like to thank the experts for their involvement, as well as the public who voted too, for the second year running: over 62,000 people were invited to select their favourite candidate.” 

The designers will present their collections to the jury on the occasion of the final at the Louis Vuitton Foundation.

The emerging designer competition set up by the French luxury giant in 2013 first issued a call for applications for its ninth edition, back in December. Nineteen young designers were then selected among 1,900 candidates who presented their collections during the showroom and on its digital platform.

"Mar 23, 2022","HBO's The Gilded Age has been a sleeper hit since it debuted in late January as a fantasy romp imagining life of the well-to-do in New York City in the late 1800s. While he was looking to a different period in New York, more aptly the Jazz Age when skyscrapers took over the skyline, Ralph Lauren similarly swept his audience away to a bygone era of elegance in the Big Apple for his Fall 2022 collection.Lauren chose a location that symbolized powerful art patrons of the era. Founded by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan, the Museum of Modern Art or MoMA opened days after the Wall Street crash of 1929. It ended up in its current location by 1939.

A gallery on the sixth floor was turned into Lauren's living room. At least the slick black-and-white one with Art Deco club chairs, black lacquer tables, white sectionals with plenty of red roses, coffee table books, and brand signature bowls of M&M's. Faux-illuminated windows depicted the tall building skyline in black and white. Artsy images of cars owned by Lauren hung on the walls (one PR rep quipped they weren't permanent fixtures to the museum, ""yet"").Once the show began—Gigi Hadid dressed in a black sweater-and-trouser ensemble opened—it soon became evident the models were cued to interact and make eye contact with the intimate audience. Lauren held two shows, 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., to accommodate the small venue. In a black-and-white color palette with a pop of red on occasion, the designer sent out looks that harkened that Gatsby-era that has always been a part of the brand's DNA.To that end, there were day and night versions of the classic color combo with his greatest hits; men's suiting for all in wool; everything from glen plaids, pinstripes, pocket-squared and worn with black-and-white brogues or fashioned into a halter evening dress complete with white tie. The elegance heated up for night with body-clinging sheath gowns; one call-out was a black one embroidered with crystals in the shape of the Manhattan skyline.

While no self-respecting tony New Yorker would dream of weekend-ing in the city, Lauren offered some sporty buffalo plaids, and alpine motifs to the mix for cabin or après-ski looks. A fair isle shetland sweater tucked into a long tulle skirt revealing riding boots in the slits was particularly cool and particularly Ralph Lauren.

Memory lane also harkened back to models associated with the house, such as Shalom Harlow, Laetitia Casta, Tyson Beckford, and sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid. The models varied in age and ethnicity—if not in size—a nod to New York City's melting pot of multi-cultures.

The show closed with a look that would seem to hold a special place for Lauren, born and raised in the Bronx. A model appeared with a customized baseball bomber jacket and NY Yankees baseball cap, the team whose famous stadium is also in the Bronx. Nothing like a bit of baseball to drum up even more nostalgia, especially in the Big Apple.

Leaving the 54th street venue heading down Fifth Avenue, a different New York emerges with empty boarded-up storefronts. This day, the Daily News headline was 'Guns Gone Wild in City' thanks to 29 shootings, one fatal, over the past weekend. Evidence the subway stabbings aren't so farfetched is a clearly mentally ill passenger shouting on the 53rd street train platform. Ralph is on to something. We are all eager for the elegant, sophisticated New York, whose ills at least were once better concealed.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 21, 2022","The Woolmark Company has announced the prize winners for the Woolmark Performance Challenge 2021/22. From more than 400 global entries, the 12 most promising ideas were picked as finalists, before judges selected the winners for each category.Claimed to be the “preeminent ideas platform for the sports and performance market”, this year, the Woolmark Performance Challenge partnered with two brands for the first time: Swiss running specialist On, and Italian skiwear firm Salewa.

On challenged participating students to “explore apparel innovations that respond to the highest demands of performance for modern outdoor runners, whilst maximising fashion-forward wearability”. Salewa asked entrants to innovate low environmental-impact fabric technologies to create thermo-regulating apparel for mountain activities.Caroline Schinle from Albstadt-Sigmaringen University was awarded an internship with On. And it created a new Research Opportunity award for Pearl Academy’s Harleen Kaur.

Seeking sustainable alternatives, Schinle's innovation is a new filling technology for padded jackets to create a 100% biodegradable product, using a novel structure as support for a Merino wool and milkweed fibre filling.

Kaur’s submission identified a gap in the market to address the needs of pregnant and post-partum runners, creating activewear that works with, rather than against, the changing body. The idea supports both the mother and foetus in the correct areas, providing coolness when the body temperature rises, and monitoring the baby’s health using a foetal heart rate monitor.

Meanwhile, Dan Winegar from the University of Oregon was selected by Salewa for an internship for his idea that automatically adjusts insulation thickness to maintain comfort during and after exercise. The resultant 3D flexible fabrics can change from insulating to cooling modes depending on the levels of skier activity.

Additionally, IED Milano student Francesco Matera was the €10,000 Woolmark Research Bursary recipient, envisioning a garment that acts like a second skin, adapting to the body in motion. His design uses strategically placed zones of high compression using elastane in seamless knitted garments to support and manipulate the wearer’s muscles and limbs during exercise.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 21, 2022","Shanghai Fashion Week has been postponed due to Covid-19, in the latest setback due to the recent resurgence of the virus in China. 
The next edition of Shanghai Fashion Week, the most important runway season in China, had been scheduled for Friday, March 25 to Friday, April 1.
 
However, last week China saw more than 5,000 new Covid infections for the first time since the early days of the pandemic. Outbreaks of the highly contagious Omicron variant prompted officials to lock down more cities and impose further restrictions. Though a relatively small number compared to many other nations, 5,000 is a significant figure for China, which has kept cases low for the two years of the pandemic through a strict 'Zero-Covid' strategy.Altogether, more than 45 million people are now under some kind of lockdown in China, according to reports by Western media that operate in China.
 
“It is sad that the pandemic situation is going up across the country and Shanghai is also battling with the outbreak of the virus. We have announced the postponement for the fashion week which was previously set from 25th March to 1st April,” Landon Du, a senior director of the Shanghai season, explained in an email.
 
So far, organizers have not settled on a different date for the season. Historically, Shanghai Fashion Week consists of several dozen live catwalk events, a handful by European brands, though mainly by Chinese designers. There is also an active fashion trade salon that runs concurrently.
 
“We are also considering doing some hybrids for show, but all are pending now. If we have new updates, we will have a new official announcement,” Du added.
 
The week’s action is usually centered around the key luxury area of the Bund, the location of The Langham Xintiandi hotel, one of the season’s sponsors.  Other sponsors include L’Oréal, Mac, Rémy Martin, DeLonghi, Visa, Pepsi and Genesis.

"Mar 16, 2022","Sarah Burton broke with tradition on Tuesday night, showing her Alexander McQueen Fall 2022 collection in the Empire State. 

""New York is exciting, creative, not speedy, but it is a fast city. I wanted to have a pace, energy, and precision to the tailoring and the coloring so to have a vibrancy and sense of character on purpose with a huge personality,"" said Sarah Burton backstage following the Alexander McQueen show noting the Big Apple influenced her approach to the collection.Yet, entering her set at the Agger Fish Building in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the mounds of mycelium and tree mulch piled 15-plus feet high may have suggested another reality: a more crunchy approach to the collection. While she acquiesced, the fungi are certainly topical in the age of microdosing; the flora symbolized connectivity to the community much the way trees are a supportive, interactive community.

In this context, Burton drew upon the themes of the McQueen woman, giving her a unique New York edge.""These dresses are individual characters; in the way we have characters in the McQueen family, it felt like they could exist in New York or any city really,"" she explained.

To that end, the show hit the note of seemingly New York tropes, at least those McQueen ideas that played out heavy in downtown 1980s New York. Leather dressing à la variations on a biker imagined as a strapless jumpsuit or cinch-waisted and peplumed jacket for example. Or a stem leather bandeau top and precisely cut, full skirt dress.

Silk faille dresses, playing with signature bustiers and plenty of ruffles and more full skirts, recalled when Madonna and Cyndi Lauper ruled downtown. One in silver seemed to hint at  Andy Warhol's factory days. A fringed and embroidered multicolor knit had a punk vibe. A graffiti-esque print that, when paired with zippers, gave off a Stephen Sprouse vibe but was made from a studio photo. ""It was a nod to the dress that Shalom Harlow wore in the '13 show,"" explained Burton, referring to the white dress that was spray-painted by robots in that seminal show. ""It was a shadow of a person moving in the studio then abstracted. It was done the same way the lacquered lace [dresses] recalled Lee's early collections. These characters, the old and the new, coexist together.""

The city's vibrancy came through in the precision tailoring, which also rings true to that Wall Street driven decade; crafty slashes and slits and strong shoulder suits à la David Byrne recalled that power era. The acid yellow, green, bright red, orange, and blue colors also exemplified the city’s frisson.

""The color palette came from looking at a photo of mycelium mushrooms—which are very topical at the moment obviously—but what I really love is how trees talk to each and heal as a creative community and work together. But [mushrooms] are toxic at the same time,"" she continued, adding the colors were found in nature.As city-centric as this collection was, the natural world wasn't far from Burton's oeuvre. She noted that 85 percent of British wools are sustainable and faille and nylon recycled. Thus far, the brand is still using animal leather but said they are experimenting with mushroom and other sustainable leathers. Indeed, in line with parent company Kering's ethos. She pointed out that the mulch was made from fallen trees, and the mounds would be donated to farms and art projects.

However, the critics love to point out that destination shows are not sustainable. Burton's conviction to show in New York was due to the strong bond she and the brand have with America's fashion capital.

""New York and America is such a big part of McQueen and has been incredibly supportive to us. We showed Dante here (1996), Eye (1999), and Savage Beauty (2011). It's part of our creative community; I've always loved people from New York, so it's great to come here and honor that.""

The city also boasts its fair share of loyal clients. Many arrived decked out in the bustier slash full skirt dresses to the post-show party at the Boom Boom Room at the Standard Hotel. To see American clients and show the collection so they can have an experience was another reason Burton gave for showing in New York.

The designer hopes to have her own experience before heading back to London on Wednesday, a simple request, really. She hoped to get outside.

""The light in New York; it's clean and sharp like nowhere else. I'd like to see the light. It's beautiful here.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 14, 2022","Zhou Zhuguang surveys his Shanghai workshop and rows of workers meticulously stitching high-collared Chinese dresses known as qipao, some of which sell for nearly $5,000.""It's a highly skilled craft,"" said Zhou, co-founder of Hanart, one of China's most well-known qipao makers.

""Some of our tailors spend a lifetime learning to make qipao.""The price tag also reflects enduring demand for the qipao, known as a cheongsam in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese communities.

Drawing on traditional design elements, the dress was popularised in 1920s Shanghai, its form-fitting cut capturing the glamour of that free-wheeling pre-communist era and the desire of Chinese women to liberate themselves from traditionally subservient roles.

The qipao disappeared after the Communist Party -- which considered it decadent and bourgeois -- took power in 1949.

The dress's comeback is due in part to producers like Zhou.

A mass-produced qipao, sometimes seen at weddings or other formal occasions, can be bought today for as little as 100 yuan ($16).

But Zhou, 59, has found a market for higher-end designs among well-heeled Chinese fashionistas.

Zhou previously dealt in lower-priced qipao before founding Hanart in 1998 in partnership with Chu Hongsheng, a legendary qipao designer who fitted Chinese film actresses and the wives and daughters of Shanghai mafia bosses. Chu died in 2017 at the age of 99.

- Cultural value -

""(Low price) isn't the true essence of the qipao,"" said Zhou, who feels that such an iconic Chinese fashion staple requires more luxurious materials, bolder designs and hand-crafted precision, which inevitably push prices up.

Zhou displayed these at a Shanghai show late last year which featured ""modern, altered qipao"" designs combining the classic Mandarin collar and body-hugging fit with less traditional elements such as lace, fringes, velvet, sequins and rich embroidery.

""We want more young people to wear qipao,"" Zhou said of his design re-boot.

To Yang Zhenzhen, who owns a Shanghai qipao shop and is an online influencer of the dress style, cracking the youth market is essential to keeping the tradition alive.

Her shop targets buyers aged 25-45 with qipao starting at around $600.

""Young people bring new life and energy"" to the qipao, said Yang, 28, who has been smitten with the dress since childhood and began collecting them five years ago.

""If young people don't wear them, then by the time they grow old there won't be anyone wearing them,"" she said.

Yang admitted that youth acceptance suffers from a stereotype that qipao are for elderly women, or the belief that pop culture uses the dress to objectify Chinese women.

""These are deep misconceptions... so I want to popularise it as best I can and let people know the real meaning of qipao,"" she said.

That includes the dress's role in breaking down gender norms for women during the 1920s. The sense of freedom associated with that will never go out of style, she adds.

For Zhou, selling qipao is about perpetuating an element of China's intangible cultural heritage.

""We are small, but we are carrying on a piece of culture,"" he said.

""That's where our biggest value is.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Mar 11, 2022","Just when some light could be glimpsed at the end of the pandemic tunnel, with physical catwalk shows making a come-back, the fashion week season was disrupted by the war in Ukraine, extinguishing the festive feeling. The Fall/Winter 2022-23 collections that showed on the New York, London, Milan and Paris runways from February 11 to March 8 2022 - originally intended to herald renewed business energy, and a new normal that is now instead plagued by fresh uncertainty - featured two distinct registers, mixing practical, comfy clothes, especially suits and cocooning oversize coats, with colourful, sexier and much more glamorous outfits, a hymn to the femininity that has been kept cloistered in the last two years.1. Tailoring  
Sportswear has featured less and less frequently in women’s collections in the last few seasons, and the trend is growing stronger as the pandemic wanes. After two years in which loungewear was a lockdown must, women are keen to wear dresses again, and to dress up. An inclination marking a widespread return to structured garments. Suits, skirt suits, statement jackets and overcoats, made in tweed and other fine wools typical of menswear, are now ubiquitous. Notably cut in ample, comfortable volumes that are nevertheless extremely elegant.2.  The hourglass jacketThis tailoring mood is conveyed most clearly by the hourglass silhouette, a symbol of femininity par excellence. A morphology that was very much the norm in the 1950s, and has now been modernised with broader shoulders, a slimmer waist and rounded volumes at the hips. Several designers have worked in this direction, with their jackets and with hourglass-shaped dresses and corsets, like Dior’s revamped ‘new look’, followed among others by Sportmax, Courrèges, Jil Sander, Proenza Schouler and N°21. 3. Boudoir bellesAlongside tailored items, featured in all collections, lingerie is making a strong come-back, introducing an array of ultra-feminine items with tulle and sheer effects galore. Body suits, corsets, bustiers, petticoats and even skin-tight Catwoman-style jumpsuits, first glimpsed last summer, are all the rage. And so are bras, which have now taken over from bralettes and often spill out, fully visible, from the neckline. Designers have notably gone to great lengths to create unusual, plunging necklines. To heighten the boudoir feel, vertiginous platform shoes, which made a first appearance in the summer 2022 collections, are now a winter wardrobe must. 4. Mini miniskirts A new mood, much freer and uninhibited, is dawning in the post-pandemic winter 2022-23, as women unabashedly choose to dress as sexily as they want. The skirt, whose length has symbolised so many battles, has shortened another notch, ending up just shy of the derrière. And is worn ideally with thigh-high boots and maxi coats.5. Wool stockingsThis taste for provocation and for pushing boundaries translates itself into a rebel teen mood, as designers clearly attempt to win over younger women. Many collections are targeting Gen Z kids, aiming for a schoolgirl look (already spotted last winter) which gives a contemporary twist to long socks, woollen stockings and gaiters that rise up along the thighs, as well as woollen tights, seen at Chanel, and opaque ones in bright colours, matched tone-on-tone with short outfits.6. Tank tops  
Seen on a number of runways, knitted tank tops with crew neck and large straps are the height of chic, undoubtedly the must-have item in next winter’s wardrobe. Preferably in the classic version, a white cotton tank top worn over a pair of jeans, leather trousers or a skirt, for an understated but uber-cool allure.
 7.  Head-shrouding garments 
 
The typical adolescent-style jacket or hoodie thrown over the head, the latter being completely covered and shrouded in the garment, is something several designers have explored. In addition to being a nod to younger consumers, this trend, which is neither very practical nor one of the most aesthetically pleasing, can be seen as indicating a need for protection. Garments cover the head and envelop the upper body, and assume a triangular shape, like a tent or an oval.
 
This approach to morphology, designed to hide the neck and part of the head, was first adopted at January’s Paris Haute Couture Week by Viktor & Rolf, with silhouettes whose collars and shoulders were exceedingly elevated, the models’ necks lost within them. This season, the same approach was followed notably by Coperni, Dolce & Gabbana and Richard Quinn. 8. Bouclé wool The need for protection is also expressed via the designers’ work on volumes, especially in very long, ample overcoats, and in cocooning shapes, with plush-effect dresses and clothes. Wool is knitted using all kinds of techniques, yielding bouclé, worsted and shaggy effects, and is increasingly replacing fur, now banned by the majority of labels. Yeti looks are by no means unusual.9. Thigh-high bootsThey are the essential accessory for winter 2022-23. Thigh-high boots are absolutely everywhere, featured in multiple colours, wallpaper fabrics, suede, silvery hues and even embroidered. They come in lace-up, dominatrix-style leather (Ambush, Del Core), in fairy-tale warrior or horseman versions (Balenciaga, Isabel Marrant, AC9), with a sexy twist in black or red leather and latex (Act N°1, Andreadamo, GCDS, Courrèges, MM6), tightly swathed around the legs (Emporio Armani, Ermanno Scervino, Givenchy) and even in the guise of angler-style waders (Chanel).
 10. Maxi clutch bags Micro handbags are about to be replaced by a new, equally coveted type of it bag: the maxi clutch. Like large, soft pillow-shaped squares, hand-held or carried under the arm, maxi clutch bags cropped up notably at Calcaterra, Acne Studios, Bottega Veneta, Diesel, Sportmax and Gauchère.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Mar 9, 2022","One brand that took a novel approach to its presentation this season in Europe was Delvaux, which returned to Paris after a two-year hiatus with its own pop-up club on the Left Bank. 
“Welcome to our own townhouse,” enthused CEO Jean-Marc Loubier, as he quaffed a welcoming glass of Louis Roederer champagne with guests in the chicly decorated club, located in a mansion on tony Boulevard de La Tour-Maubourg, in the 7th arrondissement. Where the storied Belgian marque linked up with designer Maria Pergay, who installed museum-quality furnishing by emblematic French creators in the residence, from March 1 to 7.
 
Of Russian descent, Pergay is famed for her innovative use of stainless steel. Her first collection included renowned works like the Flying Carpet daybed (1968) and Ring chair (1970). And, the artist’s blend of finesse and dominance were in harmony with the latest ideas of La Maison Delvaux. Often defined as the world’s first luxury leather goods house, Delvaux was founded in Brussels in 1829. This season, Delvaux had plenty of  hyper attractive designs.
 Like the Pin, a playful bucket-shaped bag that celebrated its half century. Crafted in Taurillon leather, with perforations that added a weightless functionality to this historic design. 
 
While Delvaux’s classic Brilliant handbag, first created in 1958, marked a new page by incorporating novel Leather D leatherwork technique, seen in a rich hazel-palette leather. 
 
The presentation marks the first since the return of Loubier as CEO, following the acquisition of Delvaux by Swiss-based luxury conglomerate Richemont.
 
During his first tenure, Loubier was known for outfitting Delvaux flagships in fashion capitals with site specific rare modern or classical furniture and mirrors. In his second stint he is already making an impact in communications.
 
For its next campaign, Delvaux called in the great South African photographer Koto Bolofo, who produced a striking series of portraits of some rather unique women. These include the American-born English model, performer, and actress, Lily McMenamy; New Zealander and premiere danseuse of the Ballet de l’Opéra de Paris, Hannah O’Neill; and Nyasha Matonhodze, Zimbabwean-British fashion model and activist.

"Mar 8, 2022","And that’s a wrap. The international runway season ended Tuesday afternoon, as a naughty tennis woman Miu Miu collection brought down the curtain on four weeks of shows.Its star element: the belted and pleated micro mini, worn both by scores of influencers in the front row, and half the cast in this autumn winter 2022 collection staged on a chilly day in Paris. The minis made even more revealing by the seating – a series of deckchairs, forcing the mademoiselles of social media to keep their knees firmly together. Besides, their seats were cunning works of art, featuring phantasmagorical ornithological creatures by the artist duo of Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg.
 
For next fall, designer Miuccia Prada wants her clients to look like they might have just have exited a tennis court, their white minis topped by matching soft-collared shirts or, for evening, motorbike jackets. Though not a sneaker in sight, dozens of ballet slippers; or some fantastic new boots.She may be 72 years old, but few designers are more resolutely trendy than Miuccia.  You just know thousands of women are going to want her new mechanic’s boots, completed with a half-dozen side buckles. 
Signora Prada also managed to capture many of the key themes of this season – semi-transparency; tough chic shearling bombers; and revealing style. Silk knickers peeped out over nearly every skirt; and shirts were cut short to expose acres of tummy. And one could easily spot bronze, turquoise and silver panties under her strass and beaded mesh dresses. Seductive chic at its most blatant.
 
Miuccia even sent out a few guys, in shorts and wee tops, the sort of lads who bring to mind the term 'transition.'
 
At times it was hard to believe that this was a winter show, so slight were the garments, before the appearance of some outstanding coats. Pacific-blue serge double-breasted coats cut almost to the ankle; or oversized, mannish chesterfields. And she took a leaf out of recent Prada shows, by placing the Miu Miu logo on the nape of the coat’s neckline.
 
All told a clever and cool collection, though ultimately a rather slight statement. But after her stellar show with Raf Simons in Milan for Prada 12 days ago, one cannot always expect the muse to sing and the style to soar at Miu Miu.

"Mar 8, 2022","Major trends became increasingly more evident on the penultimate day of Women’s ready-to-wear Paris Fashion Week for the Fall/Winter 2022-23 season. A stronger focus on targeting the Gen Z consumers has been seen through fashion houses's collections designed especially for this younger generation, whether in sportswear or streetwear lines like with Givenchy or more classic couture like with Giambattista Valli.
 Givenchy delivered a dark and powerful collection on Sunday night in Paris’ La Défense Arena. As the show began, the heavy black carpet covering the catwalk was pulled back to reveal an imposing steel structure under a glass floor where the audience was able to see the models walk from above before they emerged onto the catwalk. The audience sat on cross-shaped bleachers surrounded by four giant screens reflecting a blinding white light. 

Gloved women and men, their eyes hidden behind a cap, paraded in dark looks in a color palette composed of black, khaki, grey, and brown. The wardrobe clearly influenced by streetwear was enhanced by jewelry and futuristic glasses. Jackets and bombers were worn over tank tops and layered sweaters displaying heavy-metal graphics. The female models had their legs wrapped in leather or latex leggings covered by disproportionate shoes, while the male models seemed much more comfortable in leather tracksuits or baggy pants, baseball caps, and balaclavas with visors fixed on their heads.  The streetwear lineup included faded or frayed jeans at times decorated with pearls and paired with simple white long-sleeved knits worn equally by both men and women. On the other hand, the eveningwear preferred dark-spirited leather and opted for floating and enveloping long black coats resembling those worn in the Matrix film. Artistic director Matthew M. Williams explained that he was “interested in making clothes that people wear.” 

The second part of the show focused more on couture pieces through a series of mini knit dresses with pleats, ruffles or gathered edges that brought sudden bursts of color to the collection (sky blue, golden yellow, mauve). The designer also borrowed elements from Hubert de Givenchy’s haute couture archives, such as black thistle embroidery and his iconic pearls, which fringed tops and precious dresses made of large round white pearls that jingled as the models walked. Precious details traditional of couture were seen more than ever at Giambattista Valli’s show, who reinterpreted his opulent creations with a youthful spirit. The models perched in towering platforms hid behind oversized black glasses wearing white or flesh-toned opaque tights that matched their mini skirts and dresses. 

Different styles and craftsmanship collided, from Aubusson tapestry suits to leopard print ensembles, white mini dresses with gold buttons or more casual looks, such as palazzo pants paired with a long shearling coat decorated with embroidered borders. ""I took this free and uninhibited femininity typical of French women and transposed it to the young women of today. A bit like the birth of a new woman. Added to this is my passion for craftsmanship, which must be supported as much as possible, and all these artistic stratifications accumulated over centuries,” summarized the Italian designer.

For their evening looks, Giambattista Valli girls take out their silver and rhinestone shoes or their thigh-high python boots to go out dancing in dresses that are at times modest in water-green guipure, and sometimes precious in black lace or covered in large silver or tranluscent sequins. They sometimes hesitate between an outfit adorned with pink scales or draped dresses in white silk and printed with roses or poppy red. When they wish to wear something more dramatic, they dive into clouds of tulle. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Mar 7, 2022","Every so often, a great fashion show becomes a comment on our times. Rarely more so than Sunday’s show by Balenciaga, an exile in flight collection, by a Demna, a designer who terms himself a “forever refugee.”
 
Presented in a remarkable set – a glass walled snow-space, 60 meters in diameter – where his cast trudged in blustery winds to their destination, their clothes blown vertically behind them. Several were half naked, in underwear and skimpy blankets. In a season where fashion had seemed largely irrelevant, given the horrors of the Russian invasion of Ukraine projected everywhere and constantly worldwide, it was salutary to witness an aesthetic statement by an individual who himself was the victim of war. 
 
Back in 2013 Demna's Orthodox family were forced out of their family home in Georgia, in a violent civil war where Russia troops supported separatists in the Abkhazia region. This lead to ethnic cleansing and over a 200,000 Georgians becoming refugees. In a mark of respect at Sunday’ show, every guest was given a yellow and blue Ukrainian flag t-shirt.Demna even recited a poem – in Ukrainian – over loudspeakers, to open the show, before the first evacuee model appeared. 
 
“Until you are bound by chains, and the enemies bind your hands, your faithful sons are standing beside you. With swords in hands on guard, they swear to live and to die with you. Our native flags though covered in bloody battles, will never be covered in shame,” read Demna, in a text translated by the acclaimed Ukrainian-American documentarist, Andrew Tkach.
 
Dressed in a cloak/dresses billowing furiously, carrying shoulder bags that looked like refuse sack. Most of the cast carrying similar sacks, as if they had grabbed up their most valuable possessions as they fled their homes. Demna had originally dreamed up the set as a comment of what snow might mean in the future. 
“The future is now since when you go to ski resorts there is no snow. It’s about visiting a world in 50 years where you will have to go to somewhere artificial to experience weather we take for granted now, unfortunately,” he explained after a snowstorm of compliments for his apocalyptic show.
 
A defining moment, of youth dressed mostly in black, slimmer versions of Demna’s signature volume style – chunky jumpsuits, flared flamenco cocktails and grand governess gowns.
 
In a co-ed show, the guys appeared in black bedraggled jeans; dragoon boots or twisted cloaks, carrying their refuse sack bags. Everyone wearing Balenciaga insect shades, protection from the snow flurries.
 
“This week, I saw myself in the past from 30 years ago in a shelter like some Ukrainian boys and girls today. Not knowing if the ceiling was about to fall. So, these half-naked people making their way through the wind are very personal,” said an emotional Demna.
 
He referred to the show as “my chapter two,” where chapter one was his pre-Covid show in Paris, where the cast walked on a shallow lake, in a biblical reference.  
 
“When I began this season I wanted something positive, open space and hope, but given the circumstance everything changed. That often happens with my shows, somehow,” shrugged the designer, wearing the yellow and blue t-shirt.Much of the collection were packable outerwear and trenches in very light fabrics. And, at times it looked like the cast might have personally made the clothes. Many were sewn together denim looks, where jeans were made into tanks tops; or handbags formed by sewing together two high-heel boots. 
 
“I was once a little Georgian boy who used to dress up in curtains and play in my mother’s boots and be punished for that. So today is kind of 'my revanche',” laughed Demna.
 
Known for plastering the Balenciaga monogram on pretty much everything, Demna even playfully wrapped several female models in logo tape, to render the monogram less bourgeois and less madam.

“By wrapping the tape around them it is no longer an expression of a rich lady walking around a rich area.”
 
His soundtrack was theatrically Eastern European, a piano sonata performed by Johnandrew Slominski. Ukrainian music was played continuously in the backstage.
 
Asked, had he any message for Vladimir Putin after nearly two weeks of war, Demna replied quietly: “My only message is this show. And the fact that only innocent people suffer. Those that die in the war. I have experienced that. I blocked it out of my mind for 30 years. But recent events have brought all this pain back. So, the message is that what matters in life is life itself; human love and compassion… Fashion somehow doesn't matter right now.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 5, 2022","The atmosphere of the Parisian shows seems to have shed off some of the gloom that marked the first days of Fashion Week. Between the war in Ukraine and the influence of the pandemic still present today in various collections, we had a chance to pause and take a small breath of fresh air on Thursday through Fall/Winter 2022-23 collections that mixed classic winter outfits with more sexy and unbridled looks, such as those of Coperni, Gauchere, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, and Isabel Marant. 
 Coperni’s noisy corridors and rows of lockers transported the audience into an American high school, presenting a teenager on a journey to establish her independence. Wearing black woolen thigh-high socks, she is initially shown dressed in smart clothing. Hooded dresses, jackets, and even tailored coats in dark wool or herringbone fabrics covered the top of her head, at times making her resemble a nun.

Don’t be fooled by the teenager’s innocent and modest act however, since the looks that followed prove how she tries by any means necessary to personalize her look and stand out from the crowd. She spends her time scribbling on her handbag and pumps during class, wearing bare-legged balaclava bodysuits, or jeans so low-waisted that they end up hanging just above her knee. Shirts and mini wrap skirts gave way to more rebellious and gothic ensembles, such as knit bodysuits with matching gloves, pants tied with a ribbon below the knee, and skin-tight latex tops and dresses in pastel shades (yellow, pink, white, light blue). She exposes the sides of her torso as well as her navel while donning the brand’s signature double-breasted outfits. For the evening, she takes out lace pieces, ruffled blouses, oversized fur coats, and a small rhinestone handbag.
 
Her boyfriend picks her up, not in a classic motorcycle but in an ultramodern ride, as suggested by the speed skiing futuristic helmet he carries, the only visible innovative reference in the collection. ""This season, there was less emphasis on innovation and technology. We wanted to be in a more calm and pure spirit rather than a technical one,” explained the brand’s designers Arnaud Vaillant and Sebastien Meyer backstage. ""This collection is dedicated to Ukraine, especially to our team there. For a year, we have been working with a tailoring workshop in Kyiv. We couldn’t reach them for a week but we just heard news that they are safe,” mentioned the duo. Menswear has been incorporated in Coperni's offering through capsules for a few seasons now. 
 In the heart of the capital, under Rue de Rivoli’s arcades facing the Tuileries gardens, Gauchère took the city streets “to reconnect with real life and connect with the outside world.” “""It's a very emotional collection. It's still hard to project yourself into the future. I wanted to dress a very real woman,"" said German designer Marie-Christine Statz right before sending masculine-inspired silhouettes down the catwalk.
 
The models exuded strength and energy clad in powdered silk tank tops or bras, low-rise jeans and wide-leg pants. Their small frames drowned in the oversized, broad-shouldered men’s striped jackets. The looks fluctuated between a Berlin underground style and a minimalist rigor, with monochrome outfits that mixed loose volumes, tight fits, and fluidity with impalpable silks that barely grazed the skin. 
 
The body was exposed discreetly via mini dresses, bare shoulder tops, slit skirts, cutouts, and deep open backs. Flesh-colored tops and skirts merged with the skin. The softness of double-faced cashmere or silk met leather, vinyl, and denim injecting the ensembles with vitality. Curly wool was sprinkled throughout the collection, seen in a hooded sweater dress, a top, and a floor-length dress. 
 
Like at Coperni, male models were seen present in this fashion show, where they donned the same suits as the women. ""Men want to wear my clothes! So, for almost two years, I started to expand my range of sizes,"" she explained, amused by the fact that it is usually “the women who help themselves to the men's wardrobe.""Ludovic de Saint Sernin shared this same idea but took it to the extreme. His outfits, from the most sexy and feminine to the most neutral, are worn by men and women in exactly the same way, without any visible distinction between the genders. The designer, who divides his time between Paris and London, invited his guests to a basement that turned into a nightclub as soon as the spotlights hit the runway.
 
The return to physical shows saw him having fun strutting down the runway (almost) incognito among the models, while unveiling a collection that balanced daywear and evening wear and mixed the classic winter wardrobe, in a dark color palette of browns, grays, and blacks, with much lighter and flirty outfits. 
 
Wool and canvas coats, maxi skirts and lace-up pants were paired tone on tone with beautiful shirts that could also be worn as dresses paired with boots. Similarly, an oversized, ribbed turtleneck sweater was transformed into a knit dress. Knitwear was also used in constructing wraparound tops, straight skirts, pants and both sleeveless and non-sleeveless tops that softly clung to the body.
 
The evening wear clothing become even more lightweight, such as a blouse and pants set in transparent silk, tiny open back tops, or a mini python dress with very high slits on the thighs. Chain metal tops barely covered the models’ torsos, taking the shape of handkerchiefs tied around the neck for men and as bras for women. Rhinestones illuminated knitwear and tank tops, a floor length mesh dress revealed chic undergarments, and a long transparent black dress left nothing to the imagination. A desire for light-heartedness and fun carried its way to Isabel Marant’s collection. ""It's the ballad of a girl who's comfortable in her boots. She puts on a dress with a big jacket or bomber over it, and off she goes to hit the pavement! This is the girl I wanted to show,” summarized the designer backstage. The soundtrack playing in the background was a song by Kazu, singer of the New York cult band Blonde Redhead, and a true muse for Marant.
 
The models came out wearing boots in white, yellow, rust leather, tapestry print, and metallic blue or silver. They wore ecru-colored or sequined biker suits, jeans, or stunning leather overalls. It is best however to wear them bare-legged with flowy dresses or mini and tight outfits in stretch velvet or plush fabric. Or even better: with a smart V-neck sweater over a shirt, forgoing the skirt. 
 
""I thought of easy-to-wear pieces, bordering on sportswear. The idea was to go with essentials. It's simple, not overwhelming, with clashing textures and a strong focus on colors,"" continued the designer, who went all out with bright shades (orange, electric blue, raspberry, ocher) while integrating them into a more classic color palette (black, cream, navy).
 
Marant closed the show with a sweater in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine. ""We are wholeheartedly with Ukraine, but unfortunately we can't do much except help them out with material things. But it’s not much. The show was a little like an interlude, because we must continue going all the way. But tomorrow, it will be back to reality"", she commented.

"Mar 5, 2022","Disparity and how it generates great fashion was the thread of the latest collection by Yohji Yamamoto, a blend of denim and 18th-century style. While Alexandre Vauthier served up a lesson in how to 'decline' fashion. Yohji Yamamoto: Denim in 18th-century proportionsDisparity and how it can generate great fashion was the thread that ran through the latest collection of Yohji Yamamoto, which managed to blend today’s youthful street with the grandiose and historical.
 
A collection of humor and poise presented inside the City Hall of Paris on a chilly Friday night. Layers of black chiffon and fine wool cut into shards that managed to look lived in yet opulent. Then stitched into jackets, redingotes and above mid-calf dresses. Which, were in turn jumbled up with anthracite Eisenhowers; prim jean jackets; oversized outer-shirts and small waistcoats – all made in denim.“I wanted to mix denim with 18th-century couture shapes,” Yamamoto explained in the backstage.
 
Presented on a slanted elevated catwalk made pale gray felt, and illuminated by the enormous chandeliers of the Salon des Arts.One of those shows were the models radiated pride given the artistic skill of the clothes. All the way to long coats; cut with shoulder and collar extensions, like a medieval tower. Finished with waxed bedraggled hair and all manner of metal hangers that floated like small clouds above most models heads.
 
The designer taking his bow with two shaman-like ladies with coolie hats and rotund roll-up accoutrements about their waist.
 
Enormous applause, and a huge laugh when Yohji – who always fetes each show with champagne and skinny cigarettes - turned around to reveal a jacket on which read: 'Smoking, No?'
 Alexandre Vauthier: Techno strass on the biasDéclinaison, a keyword in Paris fashion, meaning the ability of designers to interpret their own ideas in more affordable and democratic styles, was the key to the latest ideas from Alexandre Vauthier.
 
That and some masterly bias cutting, from one of the most technically gifted designers working today.A fall/winter collection that reinterpreted his own haute couture collection into a more affordable, sexier and approachable clothes.
 
There were myriad examples, like white layered couture cocktails finished with delicate Lesage embroidery, which in ready-to-wear had necklines made instead with techno strass. 
 
Alexandre is also a distinctive tailor. Cutting tuxedo jackets pinched at the back in matte gray wool, risqué crimson leather and peak lapel white. The latter seen in a clever lookbook art directed by Franck Durand, starring Karen Elson and shot by Senta Simond.

Vauthier also showed bias-cut screen goddess gowns, except they came in pearl gray metallic sequins adding punch and power. All paired with great crystal sequined, rock-goddess spiky boots in a linkup with Giuseppe Zanotti.
 
Plus, when Vauthier likes a clever idea – like his emerald green dusted sequined trick - he will work into multiple garments. Coat-dress; bias-cut gowns; slinky cocktails; lean pants or sexy trenches.
 
“I think you have to be very conscious of body shapes. That way, if a woman loves a look she can find the form that most flatter her,” concluded the French couturier, master of how to decline fashion.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 4, 2022","With war clouds darkening all of Europe, one witnessed a moment of grace and grandeur at Rick Owens Thursday evening in Paris, as an ethereal cast emerged out of giant engulfing clouds - statuesque, solitary and sensational.Many of the cast carrying portable fog machines spouting plumes of faux fog which gradually engulfed the entire show space inside the Palais de Tokyo. Suggesting a medieval enclave of holy folk carrying fashionable thuribles.
 
A collection imagined before the very idea that Putin’s Russia might invade Ukraine, yet somehow a prescient vision of society and fashion. And an oblique comment on the duty to remain noble, amid the brutal reality of a megalomaniac gangster’s attack on a neighboring sovereign state.Rick Owens operates at the frontier of fashion and art, rarely more so than in this show, staged at the mid-way point of the nine-day Paris Fashion Week. No wonder the two hippest gallery owners in London and Paris – Jay Jopling and Thaddaeus Ropac – sat front row, perched on socially distanced metal benches. A busy Thursday in Paris with seven official calendar shows; and scores of digital displays and presentations. Though the unquestioned highpoint was Owens’ collection, entitled 'Strobe Women'.
 
A softer, subtler Owens, ironically – given the images of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson - devoid of the post Armageddon aesthetic of recent shows. Models towering over the audience, over everyone really, in massive platforms with mini radiator shaped toes; or cut-out thigh boots in shearling. Made in the bi-product of the food industry and sourced from LWG-certified family run tanneries. Even the reflective fabrics were woven from yarn made from glass. 
Wrapped in huge cloaks; substantial tunics and cowls in combinations of recycled nylon, velvet, washed denim and alpaca felt, in a reference to Rick’s great muse Joseph Beuys. Coats finished with elusive materials at collar and shoulder – like snakeskin or pirarucu, a Brazilian fish-skin sourced from a tannery, which guarantees that the fish are used as food, before their skins help support a local community.
 
“I don’t mention this out of virtuousness, we definitely have room to improve. I just like promoting the conversation fashion is having about responsibility,” remarked the California-born, but latterly Venice, Italy-based, designer.
 
Though the most beautiful passages were the exotic grand gowns composed of what Big Rick called “gobs and fistfuls of dust colored sequins.” Cut as columns or bias cut dresses, and finished with huge chunky knots of fabric at the top. Wafting in and out of the misty plumes, appearing and disappearing to the soundtrack Mahler’s 5th symphony, sadly ideal given the current horrendous war, and the cowardly invasion of Ukraine.
 
A point addressed by Owens in his final remarks: “I have always found great comfort that in the history of the world good has somehow always managed to triumph over evil. During times of heartbreak, beauty can be one of the ways to maintain faith.”

"Mar 4, 2022","When Tom Ford canceled his Fall/Winter 2022 runway collection, it was a significant blow to the already struggling NYFW Fall/Winter 2022 line-up.

Several designer star names were noticeably absent from the season—Marc Jacobs, Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Pyer Moss, The Row, and even buzzy Christopher John Rogers were among the power brands that sat out the season.Thus, Ford's withdrawal was felt particularly hard. Citing the Omicron variant wave in Los Angeles and Italian factory delays the virus circulating caused, rendering that the collection would not be ready in time for the initially planned date of February 16.

Yet, it still felt like a non-event even as the event was teased on social media the day before and confirmation of its release came over email just after 9 AM EST.With no inspiration or context given, one wondered if it was a digital silent release à la Giorgio Armani's sans music runway in Milan to support the Ukrainian people invaded by Russia's war machine. Or was it Ford's penchant for staying mute when the mood struck him?

The men's and women's collections were about monochromatic color, even if it was sometimes grounded in black as in the women's case. In this use, the pop of color – mainly jewel tones of scarlet, raspberry, violet, royal blue, teal, and Kelly green accentuated the look like a design punctuation mark.

The men's palette was similar, though he grounded the color with a rich chocolate brown, dark olive, midnight blue, and burgundy versus black. Looks in stone and white, a palette cleanser to somber the intense hues gave color reprieve.The color built upon the direction Ford laid for Spring 2022, where he referenced his early collections for both Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and the propensity for color those collections had. It also doesn't hurt that color works well on social media, a point that Ford made in the spring collection release. That season, he also paid homage to that famous red velvet suit donned by Gwyneth Paltrow on the red carpet at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. For Fall 2022, that silhouette informed both the men's and women's looks.

His sporty direction was continued most evidently in the hoods, whether as satin blouse hoodies alone or under a tailored jacket or as a detachable puffy nylon hood on a red velvet blazer. Tailored slacks he calls joggers, and nylon puffer styles reinforce the idea that no one dresses up anymore, a sentiment he expressed in the past. But when they do chez Ford, it's in marabou feather jackets, thigh-high slit skirts, and dramatic raspberry outerwear such as a faux-fur bomber or floor-length velvet trench coat.

His men's colors tended to be tonal layered looks or skewed towards a pop of color here and there—a turtleneck or socks, for instance— save for some silk blend, down-filled shell coat looks in red and light teal. Perfect for his red-carpet buddies, were shiny jacquard and zebra-print devoré velvet tuxedos, guaranteed to be worn again in the coming weeks of awards season.All of the men's looks and almost every women's look were paired with signature Tom Ford-cool sunglasses, reiterating the color message in the women's styles. The show teaser depicted a pair of stocking-clad legs wearing a wedge sandal of the same hue, which was modeled after a style Ford did for YSL circa 2004; styles that fetch as much on resale as this new iteration will.

In between the legs was a black velvet and sheer evening gown revealing just enough to leave the rest to one's imagination. A bit like this collection of stellar, exquisitely constructed, and sexy merchandise that Ford declined to introduce— its provocativeness is all you need to know.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 3, 2022","All about creative women in Paris within the last 48 hours in Paris, with four diverse collections by female designers, addressing the strong and dynamic as well as the more romantically inclined.
 Victoria Beckham: Urban logo beautyThis season, Victoria Beckham skipped a runway in London and staged a presentation in Paris, showing a collection that managed to combine two very differently silhouettes – the body con heartbreakers of her early fashion career and a selection of contemporary cocoon shapes.Beckham also unveiled a new logo, a subtle monogram that featured the left side of a V and a capital B. Seen in knit stretch body-stockings; inner city trenches; a great series of fun soft denim jeans and jackets; or bright orange matelassé cabans.
 
“Making a monogram is a big decision, since they have to last for a long time. So that’s why I wanted more of a print than just a big logo,” explained Beckham, at a private viewing of her collection in a showroom on Avenue Hoche.La Posh also unveiled her first full bag line - soft architectural shoulder bags, sleek leather buckets with gold top closures that opened into squares; and even totes made of the same fabric as the cabans.
 
A lookbook video, shot in an office tower in mid renovation behind London’s Liverpool Street station, captured the juxtaposition within this autumn 2020 collection. Head-turning and sizzling cocktails and tops made in dark sequins covered over with gauze, mixed with volume coats in snappy colored wool bouclé.
 
Beckham originally had planned to host a dinner in Paris on Friday night. But concern for the invasion of Ukraine, led her to discreetly call off the soirée.
 
However, despite the low key approach, this house feels very much on the move, both creatively and aesthetically.
 Koché: Contemporary gothic It felt like a breakout moment for Christelle Kocher, as she presented her latest street chic ideas for Koché on hallowed ground in fashion history.
 
Her setting, no less than the Salon Napoléon of the Westin Palace, the scene of most of Yves Saint Laurent’s shows in his final two decades.Emotions elicited by the soft rock gothic opening – with spiky ruffles, fishnet tights, slashed cocktails and calcio tops. An 80s power silhouette with micro cocktails cut with Flash Gordon shoulders and made in golden brocade. A bold opening suddenly leavened with soft cable knits, in a show whose cast came with red bee-stung upper lips.
 
“Emotional and comfortable couture,” smiled Kocher, after being mobbed by fashion insiders in the backstage.
 
A co-ed show with guys in paneled suits and very wide-leg pants, cut very high above the waist – the key trouser shape in Europe.
 
Though Kocher’s key talent is applying couture shapes and frills to youthful party clothing, adding sexy grandeur without being pretentious.
 Cecilie Bahnsen: Copenhagen cosplayThe Scandi fashion movement is all about girls wearing clothes in which they can ride bicycles. Not at Cecilie Bahnsen, a subtler talent who favors complicated blends of fabrics and folds, designed to be worn when walking, or better yet posing.  Inspired by the Danish poetess Tove Ditlevsen, the collection had a similar wistfulness to the poetry.

“The rain stopped, leaving only naked trees, dripping quietly,” read the intro to her poem 'Night Wandering'. A truly talented poet, who struggled with substance abuse, and took her own life in 1976.
 
Yet Tove’s influence seemed far more innocent. The cast wandering around the upper salon of the Palais de Tokyo, in scrunched up mini jackets and boleros worn over pinafores or dresses hoisted, ruched and all tied up with drawstrings. Finished with fabric petals or oddly cut leaves. Eccentrically romantic, and with moments of beguiling charm, the clothes looked ideal for an Instagram weekend in Yoyogi Park in Tokyo.
 
Copenhagen cosplay in the best sense of the term made in sugary pink; soft rose; aerospace orange and electric blue. Though the key moment was a quintet in black – especially an askew and asymmetrical dress in crinkly brocade. A singularly striking image.
 
Perhaps, by accident or influence, the collection recalled Simone Rocha, yet it nonetheless felt like a graceful fashion moment.
 
Three contrasting female fashion talents, each taking their own path.Minuit: ‘Round midnightA blend of New York energy and French seduction in this season’s Minuit, the happening Parisian ready-to-wear marque, helmed by Laurie Arbellot. That, and a homage to Charlotte Rampling, in the latest collection this season to reference strong leading ladies of the 1970s. 
 
“I love the sheer strength of an actress like Rampling; and the idea of woman not covered in accessories,” explained Arbellot, as she greeted a steady stream of buyers and editors to her third floor, 1st arrondissement office.
 
A former designer at Proenza Schouler, Arbellot taps into her New York experience with subtle tough chic patent leather mini Eisenhower jackets and cotton vernis trench coat topped with reversible shaggy faux shearling collars. Her two mannish blazers in either chunky silvery wool bouclé or crisp black fine wool, were snazzy and chic, summing up the heart of Minuit’s style.
 
Though her strongest statements were the slip dresses, cut with intricate straps, holding her model in a gentle clinch; a sleeveless column in mesh finished with twisting strings and mini logos; or the semi-sheer organza tops worn with mini bras finished with mirrored strass. Her only accessory, a matelassé satin scarf with her debut logo.

"Mar 1, 2022","Milan passes the baton to Paris, kicking off its Fashion Week this Monday afternoon, February 28. The inauguration of the week-long event took place during a grim context marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Off-White’s first runway presentation since its creative director, Virgil Abloh, passed away last November. The bittersweet day, which saw fashion coexist with the disheartening news of the war, presented the collections of two fresh names in the Parisian calendar: Vaquera’s debut and Weinsanto’s return. New Yorkers Patric DiCaprio and Bryn Taubensee, the duo behind the New York-based firm Vaquera founded in 2013, were entrusted with breaking the ice. This responsibility did not come without expectations for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion award 2017 finalists, as it was the first time the American brand showcased a collection in Paris. Considered one of the East Coast's most promising brands and boasting more than 68K followers on its Instagram profile, Vaquera caused quite a stir in the heart of Le Marais. More specifically, in the 35-37 space of Dover Street Market on Rue des Francs Bourgeois, where only an hour later, at 6:30 pm, the Weinsanto fashion show took place.

The American designers showed off their winning designs in the dark atmosphere of a rave. Inspired by the 1996 film ""Irma Vep"" directed by Olivier Assayas, the Fall/Winter collection was full of stylistic references to its protagonist, Chinese actress Maggie Cheung. Both glamorous and surreal, the mixed offering dressed the models in black patent leather latex from head to toe, creating vampiresque jumpsuits.Angry-looking models clad in juxtaposed ensembles walked at a fast pace to the rhythm of techno music, gliding briskly down the catwalk. The collection was composed of lingerie, frilly dresses, and transparent layers accessorized by balaclavas, voluptuous foulards, and leopard mittens. An array of sweaters, large knit scarves, and even pleated tartan skirts, a clear nod to schoolgirl uniforms, were presented along with mixes of lurex and gauze, voluminous bombers, coats, and black jackets. Denim tube skirts and pants added a streetwear component to certain looks. A variety of prints, silhouettes reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood and classic T-shirts stamped with a gothic interpretation of the brand’s logo completed the memorable lineup. The irreverent collection was as stylish as it was disruptive. The brand provided attendees with a QR code, through which guests could download the presented collection’s NFTs. Weinsanto in ParisWeinsanto returned to Paris Fashion Week, staging a presentation at the same location as his last show, yet in very different circumstances. Only four months after the Jean Paul Gaultier veteran's last presentation, his audience and media interest seems to have multiplied. Becoming one of the LVMH Prize 2022 finalists might have had something to do with this, where he competed alongside creators such as Palomo Spain, Airei, and Bluemarble. 

True to the theatrical and circus-themed style that characterizes the Alsatian designer’s shows, a sheer printed jumpsuit adorned with an outlandish tentacle headdress opened the “Murder in Paris” collection. The pink and violet face pattern on this look was repeated throughout most of the collection’s designs. As if coming out of a spectacle, the models sensually paraded wearing garments such as long-sleeved fitted mini dresses or a voluptuous dress in Weinsanto’s favorite color, fuchsia, which dyes his distinctive short hair.

Sensual bodysuits accompanied the corsets, a signature of the brand, and shared the limelight with velvet black dresses, sheer crisscross tops and chiffon tail dresses, accessorized with curtain draped headdresses or feline hairstyles and black round bags resembling medieval weapons. Bondage was continuously referenced through the overlapping belts, straps, and leather intimates. High-waisted thongs visible through transparent dresses and bare breasts with decorated nipples also heated up the runway. 

The best surprise was saved for last. Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, star of “Emily in Paris” who portrays Syvlie, closed the show donning an extravagant corset dress and massive bonnet in the same print of faces that was scattered throughout the collection. Weinsanto’s glamorous muse certainly ensured explosive visibility for the brand on social media platforms. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 1, 2022","The Fédération de la Haute couture et de la Mode, French high fashion’s governing body, has issued a call for collective emancipation across our societies, as demands emerged calling for the banning of Russian designers from the Paris catwalk season.On Monday, as the first shows took place during this month’s eight-day Paris Fashion Week, the industry’s governing body issue a call for tolerance.
 
“As the greater fashion family gathers for Paris Fashion Week, war has brutally hit Europe and plunged the Ukrainian people into fear and upheaval. Creation is based on principles of freedom, under any circumstances. And fashion has always contributed to individual and collective emancipation and expression across our societies,” read a statement from Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.“Given the present context, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode encourages you to experience the shows of the coming days with solemnity, and in reflection of these dark hours,” Toledano added.
 
Historically, Paris has practiced the most open borders of all the big four fashion capitals that includes London, Milan and New York. However, the invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the banning of Russian athletes and artists from the next World Cup and the Eurovision song contest, and the cancellation of Formula One races in Russia and the Champions League final in St Petersburg.
 
FashionNetwork.com has also began receiving emails calling for Russian designers to be delisted from the official French fashion calendar.
 
“We, the people of Ukraine, demand the removal of the Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko from the High Fashion Federation,” read one email from writer Yana Aleks.

Sergeenko, a couturier, shows during couture week in early July. The current Paris ready-to-wear season includes only one Russian designer, Valentin Yudashkin. However, as he is only presenting a digital video and not a proper live runway show, the Fédération indicated that they plan no further action.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Mar 1, 2022","Pandemonium ruled outside the Off-White show in the former stock market of Paris on Monday evening, hundreds of fans roaring as in walked Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. But on the catwalk there was the distinct sense of a washout.
 
A show staged on the opening evening of the eight-day Paris season that was climaxed by frighteningly tepid applause, despite the presence of supes like Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and the Hadid sisters.In a word, the first show from Off-White after the tragic death of its founder Virgil Abloh never took off, despite all the razzmatazz. From an invitation, that was a mock safety box, meant to be opened in 2030 by recipients to the bizarre staging. Why invite 300 guests into the grand marble of the Palais Brongniart, and then squeeze them into a white box? Made even more claustrophobic by the presence of a giant chandelier, reaching from ceiling to floor.
 
A collection devoid of any powerful fashion statement, largely unconnected to the current zeitgeist. An anomalous collection created by an anomalous studio team.A largely monochromatic opening of competently tailored suits; speckled anthracite mini-boleros with mini-skirts and lots of tummy; and a very ungainly series of jumpers with odd cutout chevron patterns. 
 
During his intense but too short career, Abloh was famous for his dictum that if you changed 5% of an idea, then you could call it your own. His successor team clearly share this highly debatable notion. For they sent out intreccio bags that screamed Bottega Veneta and plaid kilt suit combinations that recalled Vivienne Westwood and jockey hats similar to Gucci’s equestrian show last year.
 
Though the most telling reference of all, were a series of candle-shaped heels on sling-backs, worn under cocktail dresses. Which resulted in a huge collective eye roll by dozens of people in the audience. For, to a tutored eye, they immediately recalled looks from last season’s collection by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe. 
 
And who was sitting in the front row? Anderson. Right between Alexandre Arnault, scion of the family that own LVMH, which now controls Off-White, and Sidney Toledano, boss of the luxury conglomerate’s fashion division. Jonathan barely clapped at the finale. Quelle surprise.
 
The best early look was actually a handsome youth in off-white redingote, loose pants and white buck boots carrying a flag reading, “Question Everything.”
 
A show divided into two parts, where the second was billed as “couture.” It turned out to be a series on modern-day crinolines, made in novel materials. But whether bouffant white cotton Grand Guignol gowns; macro plissé Venetian ball looks or sexy American sports fan in multiple scarves (merci, Conner Ives), they all looked more contrived than cool.
 
That said, Gigi Hadid did look really sensational in a staggered tulle and taffeta gown, as did DJ Honey Dijon in a velour men’s suit, where one trouser leg was twice as large as the other. Virgil clearly hired one very good tailor. Not enough however, we’re afraid, to save this collection.
 
The day had begun with a hagiography predicting a golden future on a fashion news website, where the two main managers of Off-White, Michael Burke, CEO of Louis Vuitton, where Abloh was menswear designer, and Davide De Giglio, CEO of New Guards, which controls Off-White’s license, predicting a truly glowing future for Virgil’s brand.
 
Claiming that as Christian Dior barely spent 10 years in charge of his house, Abloh’s decade of work in Off-White would lead to the birth of a similarly iconic fashion marque. Which sounded a lot like our old friend hubris was back in town.
 
And, which only reminded readers of whom succeeded Monsieur Dior?  His name was Yves Saint Laurent. Virgil’s successors, by contrast, didn’t even take a bow. Perhaps just as well given the damning with faint praise applause.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2022","Ferrari has pulled out all the stops for its maiden Milanese show. The luxury sports car manufacturer put the accent on speed, technology, performance and design on Sunday, staging a striking runway show. Ferrari unveiled its Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection inside a huge hangar in Milan’s exhibition centre, within which an almost 180 m-long catwalk gave the impression of an endless asphalt ribbon disappearing into the night, barely illuminated by dancing red and blue laser lights.
 To an electro-pop soundtrack by French musician Frédéric Sanchez, the models tread the lengthy runway clad in dark, austerely chic outfits, occasionally brightened by touches of red. Ferrari’s signature colour accents the collection’s looks, cropping up in a pair of stiletto-heeled shoes, a belt, a handbag, a pair of leather gloves, a sweater, and even the lining of a lavish shearling jacket, or as a scarlet ribbon outlining the body’s curves in an ebony dress.

The silhouettes designed by Creative Director Rocco Iannone are at once powerful and feminine. His black-lipsticked dark ladies wear, with the same innate elegance, ample trench coats and broad-shouldered sport jackets in a combination of canvas and leather, flannel suits with darted trousers, vinyl apron dresses and sober suits with below-the-knee skirts, a reference to Italian film divas with a passion for Ferrari, like Anna Magnani and Monica Vitti.“I delved into the car maker’s 75-year-long history, picking up all that [Ferrari] signifies in the collective imagination, not simply in the automobile world but also in cinema, music, contemporary art and more. Everything that has contributed to making Ferrari into a legend,” said Iannone talking to FashionNetwork.com. The designer, formerly with Dolce & Gabbana and Giorgio Armani, was hired by Pal Zileri in November 2019 to embark on this ambitious project.
 
Ferrari, based in Maranello in central Italy, believes in the project and has invested significantly to diversify into fashion. Two years ago, it created the Ferrari Brand Diversification division, notably focused on developing luxury ready-to-wear collections for women, men and children. The design studio and the marketing and merchandising departments, some 30 people in total, were deployed in brand-new offices in the heart of Milan in January 2020. The pandemic did not hamper Ferrari's plans, giving instead the car maker two years to fine-tune the project.
 After a first show held at Ferrari’s headquarters in Maranello in June 2021, joining the Milanese calendar was a necessary step to bolster the brand's fashion credentials. Licensed products, created for Ferrari and Formula 1 fans, are still sold at Ferrari stores, but their range has been streamlined and a number of licenses have been terminated. Iannone has been tasked with giving an upmarket twist to these products, available alongside the fashion range in Ferrari stores, which too have undergone a thorough make-over.
 
“My mission is to develop a project consistent with the perception of Ferrari as a luxury brand, with intrinsic design and craftsmanship values, positioned in the very high-end segment of the market,” said Iannone. “Everything is strictly produced in Italy, by manufacturers that are specialists in their fields. We want our products to be peerless, and this year we will launch accessories and leather goods,” added Iannone.
 
The new Ferrari collection presented in Milan has evolved towards a more sophisticated couture architecture, enhanced by precious, high-tech materials like ultra-resistant carbon fibre that becomes supple and malleable blended with wool, with an added luminous glow. The focus is clearly on outerwear, with oversize jackets and elegant coats, one notably in white cashmere.
 
Automobile references are of course present in the collection, but subtly so. The brand's horse rampant logo is never ostentatiously on show, but features discreetly on a belt buckle or in an abstract motif. In a similar vein, the collection includes a mechanic’s overalls for men in red silk, or its leather biker-style counterpart with padded shoulders, for women, or a suit made of a shiny metallic fabric that looks like aluminium sheeting, and woollen pilot’s head-coverings equipped with visors.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2022","Like the city itself, the New York fashion community generally takes the lead especially concerning technology, diversity and social causes. The latest trend is the metaverse;  a concept coined in 1992 in Neal Stephenson's novel 'Snow Crash' and finally understood with Travis Scott’s VR concert to 12.3 million Fortnight players.

Fashion began to dabble in NFTs (non fungible tokens) in 2020, beginning with the GucciGhost by Trevor ""Trouble"" Andrew and Kate Moss's now-infamous sleeping NFT.

Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed the metaverse had arrived in October of 2021. As art forms and design creation dominate this new world, designers are likely first adopters. The question is, are designers ready to jump on yet one more platform?La La LandCalifornia-based designer Jonathan Simkhai embraced the medium, showing his collection digitally with avatars and NFT clothing. The medium melds the brand’s physical New York roots with its current innovative tech-base Los Angeles. He paired with EveryRealm, a metaverse real estate developer, and Blueberry Inc, a digital wearables production studio; both deft hands to experiment with.""It was important we entered the space in a thoughtful way true to the brand,"" Simkhai told Fashion Network, adding, ""They understood the importance for this project to be meaningful and reflective of the brand IRL.""

The designer worked tirelessly in ""virtual fittings"" with Blueberry's founder, ensuring the garments maintained the same integrity as the actual clothing.""My brand is about dichotomies, hard vs. soft or masculine vs. feminine. Physical vs. digital is the ultimate dichotomy. I'm fascinated one could be anyone they choose in this space, ultimately celebrating different backgrounds, body types, and beauty. I don't believe digital will surpass the physical experience, but the optionality introduces a new era for our industry,"" Simkhai continued.

The brand is currently testing six styles from the runway on OpenSea, an online non-fungible token marketplace, and will scale the offerings according to demand. Ideally, they will sell the NFTs alongside the physical clothes on their website.A show of firstsMarrisa Wilson, an exuberant designer and woman of color, held her first runway collection at NYFW. The designer launched the exclusive streetwear-meets-tailored-custom-prints label, celebrating multicultural women, in 2016. She discovered the metaverse in the summer of 2021 and wondered how to fit into it.

""If I, as a black woman, was trying to find my way in the fashion industry, how will I find my way into this new digital world?"" she asked herself. Wilson set out to learn everything she could about the space. For Fall 2022, she embraced the medium further by creating three hand-drawn sketches that were digitized and a special limited-edition bomber jacket, each coming with a unique NFT available via OpenSea. 

""This is all new to me, but I wanted to show black female artists that this new digital world might seem scary— and to be honest, it IS scary— we can figure it out. There's too much opportunity, and too many great artists and communities already in the Web3 (the worldwide web based on blockchain technology), NFT space, to just dismiss it because it's new and hard to understand.""

She hopes her brave leap paves the way for others and breaks down the practical.
""I see myself as a bridge from the one world —the traditional apparel industry—to this new, unfamiliar world of NFTs, crypto, Web3 while staying true and authentic to my art and craft,"" said Wilson. 

She insists the two collections are harmonious but cautions the end-user might not be.

“Consider the audience and make sure you're showing up correctly. The fashion audience is very different from the NFT community. A best-seller from your top door may not translate into the highest bid on a digital garment,"" she explained.

 ""As much as this new technology might feel sterile and synthetic, there's a real sense of humanity in the space and communities built within them,"" she continued, noting she was eager to explore further. ""It's gonna get weird!""Aku explores NYFWThe luxe streetwear brand Who Decides War by Ev Bravado and Téla D'Amore joined the virtual world with their live-streamed NYFW Fall 2022 fashion show. They partnered with Micah Johnson, crypto-mogul and former MLB player, who created a digital character named Aku, an avid black space explorer. The designers were connected to Johnson via streetwear influencer Mike Camargo aka Upscale Vandal. “We’re friends with Micah and the Aku team and were brought on to bring Aku to life in a fashion sense. The Fall/Winter 2022 line debut seemed the perfect time to merge the two worlds,” said Bravado.

After a traditional live-streamed runway show, the film morphs into a digital portrayal of the candle-lit, flower-strewn runway in a Mexican church and showed Aku in a digitized version of the brands' styles. It's a teaser of the Aku avatar launch to be announced in March. The Aku avatars, in collaboration with Who Decides War, will soon be available to purchase online.

“We have been heavily interested in Web3 and the NFT space and do more within the metaverse in the future such as creating a WDW community space, this seemed like a great introduction point to get the conversation going,” noted D’Amore.Virtual horse play One unassuming brand to venture into the space is Àcheval, a niche brand based on the Argentinian gaucho lifestyle founded by Lucila Sperber and Sofia Achaval de Montaigu. The duo presented during NYFW via an intimate dinner at Socialista featuring an emotional performance by photographer-cum-singer Sebastián Faena.

Some of the tightly-edited collection shown on mannequins would be coming to life on the Sandbox, which is, according to the website, ""a dynamic virtual world that brings players and creators together to build, own, and monetize unique experiences in the Ethereum blockchain.""

The partnership informed the childlike whimsy aimed as Gen Z, who will experience the clothing virtually.

""We have a new partner Arthur Madrid of Sandbox. The collection will twin between the metaverse and the real world,"" said Sperber. The first drop will be in both worlds in June with new products every two months.

""Gen Z will discover on metaverse and then buy in real life, for instance. They are sometimes one person in the metaverse and another in real life,"" noted Lucila.

""We wanted to capture the e-commerce vibe, and we see that we can match reality with cyberspace,"" she continued.

Madrid, who subsequently invested in the brand, is a fan of the brand as a lover of polo and horses and a major collector of NFTs. The duo spent a year developing a strategic technology plan to expand reach to new audiences and firmly believe the metaverse is for them.The waiting game Not all designers who show during NYFW are ready to take the plunge. Claudia Li told Fashion Network backstage post-show she was still very uncertain about the 'verse.

""Everyone's talking about it, and I am getting a feeling for where people stand. It's interesting, but I want to wait. I don't know a lot about that world,"" she admitted. 

Peter Do, a staple of NYFW for two seasons, showed a well-received collection displaying further refinement after perfecting the clothes in the physical world.

“What do I think about the metaverse? I am still in this world and still trying to understand it for my brand.""

Prabal Gurung was a bit more philosophical about it.

""To be completely honest, I'm in a zen-like place, having listened to a Buddhist podcast for the last six months. The concept of impermanence is more real than ever. The metaverse is something I haven't even thought about.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2022","Milan Fashion Week completed its final major shows on Sunday with a show devoid of any music by Giorgio Armani in a mark of respect to the fallen in Ukraine, and a DSquared2 catwalk show on the other side of Milan in a disused railway yard.
 Giorgio Armani: Silent respect“I have decided this season to not use any music in this show, as a sign of respect to people involved in an ongoing tragedy,” announced a speaker in English, just before the Giorgio Armani show began.
 The announcement brought forth a minute’s applause from the Covid-reduced audience of barely 200 inside Armani’s basement show-space within the designer’s private palazzo on Via Borgonuovo in central Milan.
 
A silent show, though one frequently interspersed with ripples of heavy applause, since this was a pure and thoroughly classy interpretation of Armani’s DNA, by a designer still at the height of his game.It should be recalled that Armani has enjoyed a long association with Ukraine. A decade ago, his ambassador was Andriy Shevchenko the superstar Ukrainian striker who played for AC Milan. Giorgio also has three Armani Exchange boutiques in Kiev, and frequently uses Slavic models in his show.
 
A half decade ago, at the height of the Syrian war, with millions of refugees crossing Europe, Armani themed a menswear show as a homage to the nobility of East European immigrants.
 
In Sunday’s co-ed display, he opened with haut-gamme suits and separates for both men and women in a co-ed show. The ladies in elongated jodhpur pants and mini blazers, the gents lapel-free four-button jackets and sleek velvet pants. Their very refined elegance a huge contrast, indeed diametrically opposed to the sordid ugliness of a war unleashed by a gangster dictator on Ukraine. 
 
All leading to a couture-worthy finale, a quartet of stunning diamanté and bugle beaded flapper dresses, some semi sheer, others worn over crystal sequin leggings. Before a final sapphire column look, dusted in stalagmite beads garnering another round of applause.
 
Clearly moved, Armani then enjoyed a standing ovation, led by stars like Anne Hathaway, Alexander Skarsgård, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Kasia Smutniak, Valeria Mazza and Fala Chen.
 
“I didn’t feel there was any other choice. Playing music at a moment like this seemed wrong,” commented the 87-year-old designer.
 DSquared2: Wanderlust rulesThis season, the duo of Dean and Dan Caten retained their title as the kings of Italian clubbing cool, with their latest jumbled up assemblage collection.
 
Which felt right for next winter, when they believe young kids will be surely be craving to party. They already are, though the DSquared2 duo expects them to so in multiple foreign parts.
 
A wanderlust collection of graphic ribbed skinny sweaters, baggy jeans and cords, over which were wrapped mesh scarves and blankets. Shod in North American Indian moccasins, or thigh boot versions of the same sure to be best-sellers. In a season of the thigh boot, DSquared2 had the funkiest versions in Italy.All finished with amulet belts, hippie gray pearl necklaces, cable wool beanies and giant booties and slippers. A dozen gals wrapped in plaid blankets or tulle skirts, worn over jeans. The few bags were immense padded totes – all the better to turn a weekend clubbing in a foreign capital into a long affair with a new lover.
 
“Freedom, freshness,” commented Dan Caten at a post-show lunch. “Dreams, travel, beyond,” added Dean, over a meal of Sardinian fregola and Caesar salad.
 
The result was a community of what the twins called 'bohemian travelers', dressed in paisley dresses, worn over boots and under mini mackintoshes that finished just five inches below the neck. Backpacks were ever present, as were plaid shirts, some tight into knotted headbands.
 
Layered boho beauties, whose single most important item in their wardrobe is the backpack, seen on a refreshingly innocent new cast. Led by Elisa Nijman, a willowy Dutch beauty who also walked in  N°21 and Blumarine, for whom she stars in a new ad campaign seen on a giant billboard in Piazza del Duomo, Milan’s outstanding main square.
 
Made in a rural palette of rust, amber, aqua blue and blood orange and oak, all the way to the party animal plaid kilts. 
 
Not perhaps DSquared2's most revolutionary or inventive collection, but definitely the most optimistic. In a season where designers almost pleaded with their clients to believe in the future.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 27, 2022","A Saturday which heralded two impressive debuts - Serhat Işık and Benjamin Alexander Huseby at Trussardi, and Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta – and a mega metaverse moment at Dolce & Gabbana.
 Dolce & Gabbana: Metaverse cyber punksMetaverse mania in Milan took a fresh new visage at Dolce & Gabbana, where the whole cast looked like they had emerged from an augmented reality backstage. Presented in the duo’s Viale Piave show-space with the runway turned into a huge LED screen, and a backdrop that featured a techy cartoon metropolis.
 
Most everything made with super-heroine proportions – opening with giant dropped waist men’s double-breasted jackets cut as dresses and big enough to fit three models, never mind two.In the all black opening, dozens of gals wore balaclavas or wool caps cut super high like pharaoh wives. And when Dolce & Gabbana moved into the boudoir with naughty widow stockings, suspenders  and bras, they completed the look with an entirely see-through dress finished with giant shoulders with the padding visible. Other after-hours gals appeared in zippered posh punk pants and bras.
 
Like last month in the design duo’s menswear show Machine Gun Kelly provided the music, not live as in January but in a great remix of his rock anthem with blackbear ‘my ex’s best friend.’ 
 
There was also a short series of shaggy yeti coats with matching bags in giant checks with matching booties, before Domenico and Stefano sent out their crew of dashing developer damsels.
 
Cyber babes in space age glasses, wearing lycra bodycon cocktails under ballooning down coats, satin nylon blousons and oversized hoodies – everything cut with a cowl. There might have been few Chinese in the audience, but there was no shortage of ladies from the Gulf, both in the editorial and retailer section.
 
Before the show went into metaverse overdrive - a grandiose silhouette of outlandishly large shoulders and bison size sleeves. Seen in Starship Enterprise orange tunics; DG logo ground-sweeping coats and pinched at the waist electric blue lizard cocktails.
 
Then again, if any brand believes there is gold in the metaverse it must be Dolce & Gabbana. In October, the house sold a nine-piece digital NFT collection for $5.7 million. Traded alongside some physical couture items, the brand displayed and auctioned its digital Collezione Genesi collection on the digital luxury marketplace Unxd.
 
Now, in a canny reversal by the Italian gents the virtual became real again in this show.
 Trussardi: Street regalExpressionism is alive and well in fashion and it has found its best contemporary interpretation at Trussardi whose new designers, Serhat Işık and Benjamin Alexander Huseby staged a wow-factor first show. 
At first Serhat and Benjamin seemed unlikely choices for an Italian leather specialist, since they are founders of an avant garde Berlin brand GmbH, born on the city’s dancefloors. But one second after the last model exited they were revealed as an inspired choice.
 
Working overwhelmingly in palette of black and tiny doses of silver and white, the duo whipped up a series of great flowing dalmatikons in serge wool; puffer jackets cut like archers tunics; anthracite surcoats made of shaggy matelassé, cut in a chevron pattern.
 
They paired military punk pants with streamlined bodices; and sent out Maid Marian in Berghain mini coat dresses worn with buccaneer’s thigh boots.
 
“Techno feudalism,” commented Işık in a packed backstage, where the pair were deluged by compliments. Though at times theatrical, the clothes never looked literal, on the contrary truly modern and dynamic.
 
The debut was staged in Trussardi’s historic boutique next door to La Scala, with chunks of plasterboard cut out of ceilings and walls; cement and glue on the terrazzo floor. The audience of barely a hundred perched on compress board blocks, to witness an important fashion statement.
 
The cast even exited the boutique and walked along the pavement for 90 meters before re-entering the store, igniting at big burst of cheering from over 1,000 onlookers at the finale.
 
After a slew of designers have tried their hand at Trussardi in recent years – from Milan Vukmirovic to Umit Benan –the house has, finally, found the right pairing.
 
Their atypical backgrounds – Serhat is Turkish-German and Alexander Huseby is Norwegian-Pakistani– helping to give birth to a duo who have discovered a happy home in a Milanese house founded back in 1911.
 Bottega Veneta: Luxury in motion 
A second debut in one day in Milan, this time by Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta, though his career path could hardly be more different than the guys from GmbH.And, if anything, an even more spectacular success – sculptural, though very wearable chic with voluminous clothes that flattered and never overwhelmed, both for men and women in a co-ed show.
 
Blazy has a great CV. He spent the last several years as design director in BV under his predecessor Daniel Lee; after stints in Celine, Margiela and Raf Simons, where he started his career as men’s director.
 
His experience showed in the sheer sense of luxury about the clothes, their assured tailoring and the way all the leather looks were so skillfully draped they could have been made of fabric. Often finished with ingenious belt buckles that look like post-modern door handles.
 
“I wanted to bring back energy through tailoring, especially in Italy. There has been enough streetwear!” said Blazy post-show.
 
The heart of the matter were great cocoon shaped double-breasted coats, their backs almost inflated. Made in wool gabardine or deerskin they added grandeur and class. Inspired by one particular sculpture by Umberto Boccioni, the early 19th-century Futurist artist, known for injecting motion into his sculpture, and giving them names like 'Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action'.
 
“Just because something is over 100 years old, doesn’t mean it is no longer relevant,” said the 38-year-old Blazy.
 
Artfully staged inside a dismantled auditorium of bare concrete walls, where the audience sat on black leather cushions on top of scrap steel blocks, borrowed from a car dismantling plant, where they will be returned.  
 
His cast dashing around the tea-green carpet, barely eight seconds apart, extremely rapid for a runway show. 
 
“I have not forgotten that Bottega Veneta is a bag company, so its essence is motion, empowered women on the move and travelling,” said Blazy, who selected a highly mature cast, with many veteran models.
 
“I’m really against the idea of just youth. I’d like to think my parents can come to Bottega Veneta and find things they love,” said the quiet spoken Franco-Belgian.
 
Not one bum note in a collection that included leather flamenco skirts; a trio of great gestural abstract cocktails worn with intreccio thigh boots; and a divine transparent silver cocktail worn with lilac undies by Vittoria Ceretti. A reference to sensual women in Italian cinema.
 
“I’d like to think my time has arrived. I feel secure enough, and I know how to do my job. Which is a job. Voila!” he laughed.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 26, 2022","Anti-Putin protesters made their first manifestation in fashion Saturday night with banners protesting the invasion of Ukraine, outside a Versace show dedicated to regal style.Versace: Regal'n'roll, amid anti-Putin protest 
‘No Putin,’ ‘Cut Russia from Swift,’ ‘No Swift for Russia,’ read a series of cardboard posters held aloft outside the Versace show-space in west Milan, as editors, buyers and models such as Gigi and Bella Hadid, exited the show into a chilly evening.Inside, the message was regal'n'roll, as the Versace valkyries paraded in power woman glamour. Where the key to the collection were the bustiers, cut with sculptural flourish and built into multiple garments.
 
One even formed the center of a power shoulder black wool suit, another was woven into a mini-cocktail dress, and paired, like many of the looks, with black latex leggings that ended in with Pinball Wizard high platform boots.Others were reduced to a minimalist denim and seen with chalk stripe bankers trousers and off-the-shoulder hooded aviator jackets.
 
Donatella also played with volume with a sure hand, sending out cyan blue satin coats with peak lapels; three-sizes-too-big bankers jackets combined with matching micro-mini; and enormous black felt parkas finished with huge tart red padded sleeves.
 
“Looks built on contrast and tension – like an elastic band pulled tight and about to snap-back with a build-up of energy. That feeling is irresistible to me,” commented Donatella Versace in her program note.
 
The designer did not take a bow after a show staged on a scarlet red catwalk, where all the models posed dramatically in a final tableaux vivant.
 
The show was also the final one for CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, who departs to take the same title running Burberry in London from mid-March.
 
“I will miss Donatella and Versace and Milan. I’ve grown to love Italy. But Burberry will be a great challenge,” said Akeroyd, who helmed the sale of Versace to Capri Holdings for 1.9 billion euros in 2018. If he has as successful a tenure in his new position in the UK then Burberry shareholders should be very happy.
 Tod’s: Italian beauty 
Designer Walter Chiapponi entitled Tod’s latest collection 'Italian Beauty' and that’s what he presented in a polished show and collection for the newly revived brand.Tod’s racked up solid figures last year, as revenues rose 40% to 884 million euros. And the performance on the runway inside the contemporary art center PAC on Friday morning was pretty decent too.
 
Good also to see a Tod’s show that opened with such a concise all-black statement – from Gigi Hadid in cashmere overcoat; deep gorge blazer and technical gabardine pants, slit at the bottom to semi-hide her mannish boots. Sister Bella next in flawless blouse, culottes and mechanics boots; or best of all Adut Akech in a brilliant off the shoulder cable-wool cocktail worn over a man’s white dress shirt.
 
Crisp and concise clothes for cultured and creative women. The cast marching by a series of flat screen panels showing images of iconic Italian buildings, decomposing electronically. 
 
Jaunty little boy jackets; cleanly cut long culottes; chunky knits all made for a great wardrobe. Spiced up with some great leather looks, from the ergonomically cut beige calfskin blazers to a series of shearling bomber jackets, whose elbows were finished with studded gommino patches to some great ranchero pants laced up at the side. 
 
“It’s my tribute to Robert Mapplethorpe,” smiled Chiapponi, who wore a similar pair of pants. Before, one often felt Chiapponi’s predecessors were ordered to do leather, since Tod’s is a shoe brand. But with Walter the leather looks come across more as a labor of love.
 
Not everything worked – the matelassé jackets looked too bulky as did the assemblage trapper coats. But overall this collection felt like a real winner. 
 
At the finale, the screens suddenly turned into a reportage of fans of the brand cupping their hands into hearts: influencers, 'it gals', editors and even the ever-smiling Laura Brown, who lost her position as editor-in-chief of InStyle US last week.
 
“I was thinking of masculine tailoring from Naples and an intellectual woman. Comfortable with sensuality. I wanted strict, black and giving shape the priority. In this difficult moment, the idea was to be clean and strong,” explained the designer.
 Etro: Hot hippie chic in the cloistersLooks like entering the extended world of LVMH is lightening up the mood at Etro, as the house showed it raciest collection in many years, ironically inside the cloisters of a baroque church.
 
For the past two centuries, the space has been Italy’s largest musical conservatory, where Veronica Etro was very much on sing with this collection.The designer trying out all sorts of risqué ideas from revealing crocheted naughty squaw dresses to Ibiza hippie hipsters and bra tops. Flesh was exposed in almost half the looks… in a winter collection. Leotards paired with buccaneer boots captured the new liberated mood.

Plenty of Etro’s signature fabric – colorful paisley, but worn as haute-bohemian chic, and not bourgeois weekend wear. Paisley in tangerine matelassé trousers, flared wool pants and one-sleeve mini cocktails. Party gear par excellence including fringed boho bags with gunslinger shoulder straps; hoodies with Mexican drawstrings and lizard print boots with golden amulet ankle rings.
 Luisa Beccaria: Fragile romanticismDespite this dark moment in history, attending Luisa Beccaria’s latest presentation and its painterly collection felt somehow right.
 
“Romantic, feminine and fragile. I believe we need these emotions, especially now,” commented Beccaria, who showed her collections inside the glasshouse of LùBar, within the natural history museum of Milan. 
A hyperchromatic series of clothes often playing with the same print in multiple forms.
 
“Sarah Jessica Parker wore this coat in 'Sex and The City', so we revived it from our archive,” explained the designer, pointing to three new versions. A slimline velvet coat; a long chiffon evening dress and a cool evening cocktail.
 
Luisa and her daughter Lucilla also unveiled a charming video – shot by Amaranta Medri and entitled 'Ludic Mood'. Shot inside the atelier of artist Sofia Cacciapaglia, whose workspace is a series of soaring walls made of discarded cardboard boxes painted impressionistically. A perfect setting for the Sicilian designer’s blend of lace, stretch satin, devoré velvet and trompe l’oeil prints.
 
In another link-up, Beccaria created some beautifully delicate evening coats, made of shearling by Clementine Tivoli of Turin, and trimmed with her embroidered florals. Like the collection, they had a great sense of luxurious optimism.
 Durazzi: A magna cum laude debutOne new brand that made a brilliant first impression is Durazzi, a cool take on equestrian style by Ilenia Durazzi, a debut signature collection presented in a Brera apartment on Friday.
 
Though only 34, Ilenia is highly experienced – having spent the past 12 years designing the menswear collections of first Balenciaga for Nicolas Ghesquière and next Tod’s.  
Her multiple takes on urban horsey chic all had great wit and panache; a blend of fine tailoring and ironic detailing. From the precision cut matelassé riding vests made into smart jackets or beautiful fringed mini-skirts, to the exact riding boots that flared up at the knee.
 
Finishing skirts and even tights, with fringes made to look like mini-manes – and a reference to fetishism by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Méret Oppenheim.

While Durazzi’s preppy slimline cardigans and shearling bomber jackets had all the finish one expects from the two brands were Ilenia has worked. 
 
A lookbook video included an Appalachian horse, whose silver dappled color was echoed in leather pants with multiple holes.
 
“I wanted equestrian codes but for modern and real women. Taking menswear ideas but to make a women’s wardrobe,” explained Durazzi, who rides regularly herself.
 
Born in Urbino, Durazzi graduated from Polimoda in Florence. At just 22, she enjoyed an internship at Balenciaga which within two months led to a job at the Paris house.
 
Now her slow boil of a career has accelerated two gears, with one of the most accomplished debuts we've seen in the past decade. Durazzi is that good.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 25, 2022","Milan’s atmosphere becomes more and more eclectic as Fashion Week progresses. Moschino and GCDS marked the return of innovative runway shows, both slipping in a mysterious golden key into their invitation cards and exceeded expectations on Thursday evening. Meanwhile, Plein Sport immersed its audience into the metaverse. 
 Moschino’s key gave access to a sumptuous hall designed between a Baroque and Louis XIV style. The hosts welcomed guests into a grand living room featuring bright white tile floors, pedestal tables, armchairs, and antique paintings. The models strutted about with added emphasis, striking exaggerated poses here and there to show off their ensembles. 
 
Their chic black and white tweed sets and cropped jackets with golden buttons displayed detailed elements that, on closer inspection, seem to have come straight out of the palace’s furniture. Antique gold keys hung from micro-bags and were seen stamped throughout a black velvet jumpsuit while a keyhole framed the chest area of a fitted dress. It was then silverware that took center stage. Golden spoons and forks applied on dresses and jackets replaced military trimmings. Gold detailing illuminated collars and cuffs, inspired by the panels and gold leaf adornments of the building’s antique furniture. The red velvet fabric on the armchairs and sofas was replicated in red quilted bustier dresses and jackets, while curtains, fringed carpets, and tapestries inspired the majestic train dresses. 

A grandfather clock was transformed into a sheath dress, Japanese screens into a geometric dress, while gold frames stood out from the clothes they pompously bordered, at times seductively placed framing the breasts or buttocks. Moschino’s usual delirious and playful take on accessories was scattered throughout the runway looks; Mini crystal chandeliers hung as earrings while curtain tassel cords acted as belts, a lampshade transformed into a hat (as well as an antique porcelain vase and a candlestick), and a silver tray morphed into a bustier top. Everything shined and sparkled throughout this particularly kitsch and baroque-inspired lineup. 
 The GCDS show opened a door to a whole different realm. Behind a mysterious and misty door bathed in a red glow at the end of a catwalk, fantastical creatures walked out one by one. Sleeping beauties appeared wearing mohair-fringed cutout playsuits in pastel shades. Witches, on the other hand, wore glamorous dresses with big bows under magnificent coats in neon pink, apple green, and white.
 
The hooded women donned long-haired or curly wool pink dresses, resembling Yetis wearing patent thigh-high boots. Superheroines also made an appearance: Catwoman was uniformed in a blood-red pair of boots over an openwork pink mesh jumpsuit while Black Widow hid behind a long lace veil, wearing stockings and a garter belt. 
 
Plein Sport changed the scenery, plunging its audience into a digital dimension. German designer, Philipp Plein, did not orchestrate a fashion show for its sportswear line’s big relaunch, but instead opted to immerse his brand into a new intangible universe. His recently purchased space for building a hotel in the heart of Milan was transformed into a spaceship with numerous screens.
 
One of the screens opened up suddenly in a flash flood of lightning, revealing a humanoid metallic robot moving forward into the middle of the stage on a metallic pedestal, introducing itself as Romeo 0.1. The designer took the opportunity to present his many NFT and metaverse projects to the public through Romeo after just recently investing the equivalent of $1.4 million on a virtual space in the Decentraland metaverse. 
 
Through these digital implementations, Plein Sport aims to become ""the most advanced technological brand in the luxury sector” though so far, we have only seen the brand exhibit virtual sneakers.

"Feb 25, 2022","Milan Fashion Week on Friday revealed the many facets of the female temperament through Fall/Winter 2022-23 collections, illustrated by the strong desire to dress for evening outings, to seduce, and to have fun again. This was the case at Missoni, which focused on a carefree young woman dressed in casual chic ensembles while at Sportmax (Max Mara group’s young line), the studio worked around the theme of seduction.
  
After Angela Missoni’s retirement last May, the brand redraws its image under Alberto Caliri’s vision. For his second collection, Missoni's former right-hand man of 20 years broadened his offering around a more wearable, everyday wardrobe, inspired by the golden Milanese youth of the 1980s and 90s and their carefree spirit, laying the groundwork for this new chapter in the Italian fashion house. 
 
While the label’s signature knitwear featuring its recognizable zigzag pattern was still very much present, it was now textiles that took center stage. Strutting in their pointy boots, the Missoni girls displayed their bodies in bikinis under long herringbone bathrobes, or even under casually throwed-on rugs, balancing intimacy with a more sporty and punchy aesthetic. A Rockstar attitude was expressed through red leather jumpsuits and biker pants and jackets, as well as in loose flared jeans and extra wide low-waisted pants worn with tank tops or knits. Knitwear made its way into cozy co-ord sets, comfy joggers, jacquard bustiers, classic sweaters, mini-dresses, and other striped coats, where zigzags expanded into zebra patterns emulating a jungle look accented by python boots. 
 
In the evening, the looks were illuminated by mesh dresses that were both tight and flowy, knitted with glittery lurex threading, like the one worn by supermodel Eva Herzigova who closed show. The featherweight garments were shiny, opaque, metallic, luminous, or shiny. ""I wanted to mix the strong female character with the iconic knitwear of the house and beautiful denim, while exploring her more delicate, almost childlike side,"" summarized the designer backstage.The Sportmax show following Missoni’s provoked an element of shock, exacerbating feminine seduction to the extreme. An endless, bright pink corridor, lined with a string of doors as if suggesting a licentious meeting area, served as a catwalk. The leather-gloved femme fatales with smokey eye makeup and bright red lips crossed the stage, the length of their legs highlighted by the seam of their black stockings. 
 
1940s femme fatales, donning ultra-chic suits paired with straight mid-length slit skirts, moved aside to make way for the powerful women of the 80s. Menswear inspired suit and ties, squared but nevertheless cinched at the waist to better emphasize it, worn with a red shirt walked by followed by the androgynous style of the 1990s. Everything intertwined and mixed to create a wardrobe of strong, erotic character. 
 
The bra cups integrated into the garments protruded from the necklines. An array of bodysuits in the form of blouses and metallic or leather bustiers were worn with jersey or stretch wool dresses. Meanwhile, a gray bra closed a matching suit jacket cut in the same masculine fabric. 
 
Black vinyl tied the sexy panoply together, constructing strapless dresses that draped around the body, shiny red leather on coats, and the long, one-sleeved slit dresses in jersey covered in glittering rhinestones. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 25, 2022","""I'm dead nervous and anxious. Things have gotten really bad today,"" typed Tani B. in a brief WhatsApp message on Thursday, February 24, in the early morning hours. The war had begun. Military planes flew over Kyiv and explosions and sirens awakened the residents of the capital by five in the morning. Long gone are the days when the 22-year-old model enjoyed her first steps in the industry in Spain, just like so many of her fellow Ukrainian models. Tani B. garnered success within a short period of time, walking for Armani on several occasions and starring in Zara catalogs, Hoss Intropia campaigns, and magazine editorials.

""Despite the pandemic and the scarcity of jobs during the first few months, it was a peaceful time enjoying the sun and learning Spanish,"" she recalled of her happy days in Valencia. A year and a half after her arrival, the expiration of her visa forced her to reluctantly return to her native Ukraine last January, when reports of the conflict were limited to ""tensions"" with the neighboring country.

""I had a feeling that something was going to happen upon coming back to Ukraine, but I also realized that I never missed the country that much. We are afraid. For a long time, we didn't want to believe that something like this could happen. We knew that someday things would get complicated, but no one can prepare you for this,"" said the young model, assuring that she does not want to be a ""coward"" and flee the country where she now resides with her grandmother.The unthinkable happened within a matter of hours. Putin's troops invaded the sovereign country on all four sides, took control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and started attacking Kyiv, claiming that they only targeted ""military objectives”. Thousands of civilians took the safe decision of fleeing the country, while others took refuge underground for the night as bomb threats continued. Elite model Julia Ratner’s family were among these people. ""We will never forget this. I have spent the worst 20 hours of my life. I can't sleep while my whole family is sleeping underground in the subway,"" said the model, who suddenly went from starring on the cover of Elle magazine or one of the latest Nodaleto campaigns to becoming an activist on social media platforms. Through her Instagram profile, @dear.ratner, she spreads awareness about the current situation and provides contacts to help her compatriots seek asylum in other countries.""He's attacking freedom, democracy, equality and all the values of the Western world.""A few hours later, in the early hours of Friday, February 25, Maria Mokhova watched in rage and disbelief as the foundations of her country's democratic freedom crumbled in the wake of explosions in her city of Kiev. ""My foreign friends keep asking me why this is all happening. It’s because that asshole can't stand how free, beautiful and rich my country is. He is not only attacking Ukraine today. He's attacking freedom, democracy, equality, and all the values of the Western world,"" reflected the L'Officiel Ukraine journalist and co-founder of the White Rabbit PR agency, which specializes in promoting Ukrainian talent. Only 72 hours before the outbreak of war, the city's atmosphere bore little resemblance to the period of invasion. “Life in Kiev goes the usual way; it is still difficult to get a table at a trendy restaurant on a Friday night. We carry on with daily life, work, and plan our events for the upcoming season,” explained the industry expert on Monday, February 21. Her plans to travel, as per usual, to Paris Fashion Week remained in place since she already pinpointed a feeling of “concern, anxiety, and even panic” in Ukraine for many weeks. This uncertainty has not derailed the activity of the national design industry, which saw a good handful of designers participating in New York Fashion Week and has already set the dates for the Kyiv Art & Fashion Days festival scheduled for next May. The reality is that the threat of war looks different from the inside after your country has suffered violence over the Euromaidan protests, saw Russia invade Crimea, and witnessed the proclamation of independence in the pro-Russian regions of Donestk and Lugansk throughout just this last decade. 

""We have been living in a state of war for the past 8 years and, even though it is absolutely horrible to admit, the truth is - we got used to this constant threat and pressure,"" Mokhova acknowledged, assuring that this time, however, the situation seemed ""much more dangerous than ever."" ""Nobody wants war, but our country is prepared to defend itself. Business operates mostly as usual, although with investors pulling out capitals from Ukraine the economic situation might truly get worse.”""We have been living in a state of war for the past 8 years.""To keep moving forward despite adversity is -- in addition to being the leitmotif that characterizes the Ukrainian population’s power of resilience -- a sentiment shared by most of the brands and designers contacted for this article. ""My brand has successfully survived several major crises in 2004, 2008 and the beginning of the war in 2014. I believe we have developed an immunity to such crises and will be able to cope with the current circumstances,"" Lilia Litkovskaya, founder of her eponymous brand, confided a few days ago as she prepared her Paris Fashion Week presentation and finalized her collections for retailers in France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and China. At the beginning of the week, the artisanal tailoring brand was still going about its business as usual. Imports and exports had not yet been affected by the ""crisis"" and international sales continued, although local sales were beginning to be affected and those from Kazakhstan had decreased given the ""political turbulence"". Irina Dzhus had also planned on showcasing her avant-garde and concept brand Dzhus in the French capital. “This uncertainty has already influenced our strategic decisions,” said the designer on Wednesday, February 23, after opting for a digital presentation in Paris as opposed to a physical wholesale showroom the designer has commonly organized in previous seasons. ""For us, as a niche and independent brand, these organizational expenses would have been significant, whereas our current priority is to save more financial resources for unpredicted situations,"" she explained, fearing that the current political climate could reduce the interest in Ukrainian design from international partners. ""If the situation changes for the worse, affecting supply channels and the safety of the manufacturing process, the orders might not be completed, and considering the force-majeure circumstances, the clients might not be refunded for the failed operations,"" she analyzed.

Fresh out of New York City, Theo's CEO and creative director, Teo Dekan, still adopted a certain serenity despite growing concerns within his team a few days before the war: ""We are trying to stay positive and focus on our current workflow. We have presented our new collection at NYFW and now it’s sales season so we remain calm and stick to the plan.” Things are different now. ""Honestly, we did not expect this would really happen. For the last 3 days our main task is to make sure all members of our team are safe. We are supporting Ukrainian army, helping friends and families. War must be stopped"", said the designer, on February 27.

This calm attitude was also shared by the brand, Kachorovska last Thursday. “""Despite everything that is happening, we stay focused and continue on with our lives. Spreading awareness about the war, buying products made in Ukraine, supporting volunteers and the Ukrainian army and informing at all levels are necessities just like air,"" said the brand, which, between February 21 and 25, presented its collections at the Archetype Showroom in New York, along with five other Ukrainian brands: 91 Lab, Chereshnivka, Elena Burenina, Paskal and Frolov.

Ivan Frolov rightfully insisted that, even though the perception of the situation by the local community and the international spectators is ""definitely different,"" he felt the support outside his country’s borders. ""The main thing here is that the international audience tries to get into this situation deeper than ever before. People show huge amounts of support and increase international awareness on what’s happening in Ukraine. And this is vital for us today,"" commented the brand's founder and creative director, aware of the foreign view of Ukraine as a ""high-risk"" market.“Crazy political threats don’t let fear and panic dictate our choices. It's true to say that the fastest growth happens in the most difficult times. We manage to develop our brand constantly, even though our country hasn’t been at peace for the past 8 years. And we only hope to continue to grow and complete our strategic goal, as being part of the Ukrainian creative industry. It’s about supporting each other and making a great impact in building our economy as a whole,” analyzed the designer who specializes in corsetry. At the time he answered these questions, Ivan was confident in his government and believed in a ""diplomatic solution to the conflict"" without the need to reach military actions. ""No matter what, we’ll do all in our power to resist the imperial ambitions of some politician,” he concluded.

For their part, Tetyana Zemskova and Olena Vorozhbyt had been sleepless for days before the first attacks, going for early morning walks to try and calm their distress. ""It seems like everyone is slowly getting used to this nerve-wracking situation,"" acknowledged the creative duo behind the Vorozhbyt & Zemskova label just a couple of days ago. Despite the fear of possible cyber-attacks, the Ukrainian designers were confident that the situation would not turn into a ""bloody war, but a hybrid war"", a threat they felt they had to ""prepare for not only psychologically"".""All you need is peace”The invasion of Ukraine has caught everyone by surprise. Some in the West believed that Putin was bluffing and that he would not go so far as to challenge European peace due to the risk of sanctions from the allies. The Ukrainians, for their part, learned to live with the omnipresent tension provoked by their enemy. But no one could really imagine how and at what speed Putin's troops would implement a breakthrough. Just last week, the Gudu label was confident of stability and ""not succumbing to panic attacks"". The brand's teams know what they are talking about since they are used to threats from Moscow. Founded in 2015 in Kyiv, the company is Georgian designer Lasha Mdinaradze’s project. Her country of origin suffered Putin's attacks in 2008, when it recognized the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Under the government of Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, the nation announced that ""due to national interests"" it will not participate in international financial sanctions against Russia. ""We are not our government. We are with Ukraine,"" stated Sofia Tchkonia who is also from Georgia this Friday morning, February 25, standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. The driving force behind the Kyiv Art & Fashion Days festival that promotes the capital’s designs was just a few days ago in the midst of designing the invitations for the second edition of the event scheduled for April 22-24. The entrepreneur, whose activities are focused on promoting fashion events with emerging brands in markets outside the traditional circuit of the major fashion weeks, continues to organize the Tbilisi fashion week to be held in Georgia at the end of April.

The Tsum Kyiv shopping mall has been displaying a huge ""All you need is peace"" message in bright red letters for a few days now on its building’s exterior, demonstrating a political and social responsibility that is rare to find in the department store sector. Today, with shutters down, the imposing building not only presides over the Khreshchatyk shopping street, where flagship stores of brands such as Zara or Mango are also located, but is also part of the capital city's history. Opened in 1939 as the country's first department store, Tsum suffered fires and extensive damage during the occupation. However, its imposing façade was one of the few on the road that managed to remain intact. Its reconstruction that started in 1944 turned it into one of the architectural landmarks of Kyiv and an epicenter of fashion and modernity. Its evolution, however, did not prevent its country from seeing blood spewed in the Independence Square, a few meters from Tsum, during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014.Learning from past mistakes requires the right amount of anticipation to be able to react in time. Looking back, many people are still surprised that Covid-19 seemed to be at first an issue as far away as China itself for Europe. And while Northern Italy was being struck by the pandemic, the Milan Fashion Week shows continued to entertain its guests just a few days before Paris Fashion Week kicked off and European governments declared a state of emergency and the confinement of their citizens. 

The framework is repeated, dates coinciding with each other and all, leaving the industry wondering how long it will be able to continue looking the other way. 48 hours before the outbreak of war, the richest man in Europe, Bernard Arnault, inaugurated with great fanfare the brand-new Louis Vuitton ateliers in the French city of Vendôme. And last Thursday 24th, the first news of bombings on Ukrainian territory coexisted with the Max Mara, Prada, and Emporio Armani shows for Milan Fashion Week. Many attendees asked themselves how they could continue working and celebrating while Europe is in shambles.   

Certainly a bad time to be optimistic, but that same day, while Russian tanks advanced determinedly towards Kyiv, Tani B. maintained the hope that characterizes the Ukrainian people’s courage, looking over the horizon beyond the gray clouds of the military invasion. The young model hopes to relive her dream and be one of the models walking down the catwalks of Milan or Paris. ""When peace returns, I would like to go back to traveling and working all over the world. Maybe even live in Spain again, but my house and my heart will always be blue and yellow,"" she declared. Ironically, her last message sent was also a heart, but this time in white.

"Feb 25, 2022","Capasa Milano sparked Milan Fashion Week Women into life on Tuesday evening, plunging its guests into the heart of fashion. For his return to physical runway shows, designer Ennio Capasa had the bright idea to hold his event backstage at a Milanese theatre, a chance for a convivial get-together that was welcomed by the fashion world, starved of personal contact for nearly two years owing to the pandemic.By no means a novel idea, Gucci had done the same pre-Covid, but the formula, marking a return to business as usual for everyone – it was Capasa’s own catwalk come-back after a six-year absence - was a success. Capasa, who had taken a step back after selling his label Costume National in 2016, invited his guests - notable among them the CEO of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri - at the Teatro degli Arcimboldi, located in the Greco Pirelli neighbourhood, a former industrial area on the outskirts of Milan.
 
Guests had to step behind a thick red velvet curtain and venture beyond the stage, into the wings and dressing rooms where they came across models, hair stylists and make-up artists busy with their preparations, while in the corner of a room Capasa was illustrating his collection to the press. Suddenly, a speaker announced the show was about to start. “Three, two, one,” and it got under way, to the post-punk sound of a live performance by local band Starcontrol.Everything was designed to make the launch of Capasa's new project as unemphatic and light-hearted as possible. “This is collection zero, quite rightly called ‘Before It Starts’. I’ve borrowed the timeless element of Costume National, which was a much more radical label, because those were more radical times, and moved towards a style that is more open to fusion and individualism. Essentially, what I used to do was create a kind of uniform. Nowadays, everything is much more varied and open,” said Capasa.
 
With Capasa Milano, the designer is tapping the classic Italian tailoring tradition, infusing it with a breath of fresh air and a contemporary feel. The collection notably features a series of superb oversize suit jackets, laser-cut, thermo-bonded and hand-finished in impeccable fashion. These elegantly styled jackets, in black or in strong hues like emerald green and ruby red, are matched with flowing trousers or skirts, making up sets that can be worn by either men or women.
 
All the items are indeed unisex, and featured in a wide range of sizes. A draped dress fits snugly on a woman's body, or can be slipped over men’s trousers like a tunic. The wardrobe gradually introduces a more casual, sportswear-style register, with items that are nevertheless quite upmarket thanks to the sophisticated architecture of their shapes, proportions and materials. The label pays a great deal of attention to fabrics, from taffeta to velvet, eco-nylon, silk crepe, Japanese denim and others, and “endeavours to use sustainable fibres as much as possible.”

The edges of a tweed jacket are left raw, a pea jacket features puffed sleeves, an apple green satin shirt slips into very high-waisted black leather trousers. Occasionally, one feels a little lost amidst the plethora of styles and characters within Capasa Milano. Only to pick up the thread again through the label's accessories, all of them interesting and original, from assorted rocker-style boots made by Himco, to the unique silver jewellery created in collaboration with Gianni De Benedittis of FuturoRemoto.

"Feb 25, 2022","A magisterial performance at Prada, in the finest collection so far from the duo of Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons. Yet, a darkly bizarre moment where fashion fought to be relevant on a day of infamy in the Ukraine.The show in Milan was quite brilliant - a reinterpretation of the house’s codes which nonetheless looked very fresh and very new. The mood elsewhere was dark.
 
A show staged on the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an attack which visibly affected the atmosphere of most of the audience. Nonetheless, that did not prevent a huge gang of teenagers gathering outside the Prada Foundation in industrial south Milan, to mobile phone stars like Kim Kardashian as she entered the show.Many of the component parts in the collection were classical Prada: felt wool; burnished leather; strass and just-below-the-knee lengths. Though, with a new quotient of naughty new transparency, and a sexy but stern mood. 
 
Yet, the defining look were spy-coat leather coats and jackets. Dramatic cool chic which suddenly had become ominous.
 
“I am glad the show went well. But I was much more worried about what is happening in Ukraine. Hopefully the western sanctions can help bring down this Russian government,” said Miuccia.
 
Back on the catwalk, the mood was stern yet sexy from opening look, with Kaia Gerber in a white ribbed canoe-shirt, over a skirt made of a triple band of black nylon, anthracite silk and transparent lurex, over which was sprinkled abstract flowers. The design duo showed a dozen variations on this theme all the way to the final look. In a show that featured a gang of veteran supes - Liya Kebede, Élise Crombez, and Hannelore Knut – all of them owning the space.
  
Plus, you just know, the house will sell thousands of those t-shirt tops, even if for a winter collection it was a somewhat skimpy attire.
 
But the key component was the dynamic tailoring – in particular the voluminous, raglan shoulder, dark gray blazers and jackets. While for inclement weather a series of surgically cut Pacific-blue great coats finished with silver metal chains were hyper elegant.Raf’s influence was also apparent in leather spy-coats – again cut as if two sizes too large, with 80s power shoulders – and made in hues of tobacco, royal blue and pink. However, the cover shot look was definitely the felt power coats, finished at the biceps with feathers
 
In a collection where upside down triangular logos were everywhere – from the front of t-shirts to the backs of spy-coats. The models appearing in waxed helmet-shaped hairdos.
 
However the show, staged in a cavernous green carpeted space, despite its great clothes, felt foreboding.
 
Through no fault of the designers, the show and collection echoed Jean Renoir’s 1939 'The Rules of the Game', a satirical comedy that captured the fatalistic mood as Europe drifted into WW2.
 
We know that fashion is about clothes. But not just that. If designers truly think of themselves as artists, as most of them do these days, then runway shows cannot be a comedy of manners in the current crisis.
 
If creators and their clothes become callous, like the figures in The Rules of the Fame then quite frankly our industry is lost.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 25, 2022","The Fashion Trust U.S. announced on Thursday the inaugural members of its board, including leading voices in the U.S. fashion industry. The non-profit initiative dedicated to discovering, funding, and nurturing young design talent, said that former InStyle editor-in-chief Laura Brown, Anne Crawford, media personality Tan France, Harper’s Bazaar editor-in-chief Samira Nasr and celebrity stylist Karla Welch will join co-founder Tania Fares on the board. Likewise, philanthropist Francesca Dutton will serve as director.

“I am excited to be launching Fashion Trust in the U.S. alongside an incredible group of people who advocate for creative communities across the country,” said Fares. “The Fashion Trust has come a long way since its inception in the U.K. and I can’t wait to support the diversity, talent and culture of American design.”U.S.-based designers in business for at least three years are invited to apply to the Fashion Trust, which first launched In 2011, in the U.K. Following a review by a board of industry leaders, the winners and grants will be announced at the prestigious annual Fashion Trust U.S. Awards in early 2023. Winners will be awarded financial grants and mentorships covering budget, strategy, digital, merchandising, and general business support.
 
Since inception, the Fashion Trust has acquired 145 donors, raised over £3.5 million and financially supported 39 designers. It also expanded to the MENA region in 2018. 

“I could not be prouder to join the board of Fashion Trust U.S.,” said France. “The Trust has done incredible work supporting designers in the U.K. and the Middle East, championing those who would not ordinarily be given this great opportunity.”
 
“I am grateful that Tania Fares is bringing the Fashion Trust across the pond, and am proud to be part of this community,” added Nasr. “This will be an incredible opportunity for young American designers to find support for their business and shine both at home and beyond our borders.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 24, 2022","The fashion set put their best face forward on Thursday despite worries over the invasion of Ukraine, as Milan Fashion Week guests and workers vowed to go on with the shows.The lineup, which included Emporio Armani, MM6 Maison Margiela, Prada and Moschino, appeared to go off with all the studied nonchalance expected at fashion events -- but some admitted it was hard to focus, given the situation in the East.

One Ukranian stylist and creative director, Anna Mazzhyk, said she was awoken by her parents at seven am, only to learn ""Russia is attacking Ukraine right now,"" she told AFP.""I was crying before the first show because it's difficult for me,"" said the 22-year-old Kyiv native, outfitted in a puffy Prada vest and surrounded by her equally spruced-up friends.

""We're all wearing sunglasses to cover up our puffy eyes,"" she said.

Belgian model Louise Robert said that Ukranian model bookers backstage at Prada were visibly upset, trying to figure out when and how they could go home.

""It was like a bomb -- an emotional bomb,"" Robert said.

Still, makeup artist Chiara Tipaldi, 24, had acknowledged at Max Mara that although everyone was aware of the latest news, the fashion world operated as ""a parallel universe"".

""It tries to be cut off from what goes on in the world,"" Tipaldi said.

One French videographer inside the show, who gave his name as just ""Etienne"", said perhaps that was for the best.

""I think most people are crushed,"" he said. ""But we can't do politics inside here.""

Indeed, the runways offered up distractions galore for guests, including Kim Kardashian -- thus far the fashion week's biggest celebrity -- in the front row at Prada, sheathed in avocado and black leather, to watch a newly redheaded sister Kendall on the catwalk.

At Prada, co-designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons paired simple white tank tops with narrow, tiered cigarette skirts adorned with spangles, leather, or transparent panels at the thighs.

Shoulders were oversized on black dresses that incorporated chains at an angle at the neck, while tweed overcoats offered a touch of whimsy with poofs of curly lambswool at the biceps in green, pink or blue.

- Cages at Cavalli -

Earlier, Max Mara's Ian Griffiths showed a comforting collection whose brown and cream tones and rich textures brought a reassuring sobriety to the mix -- even as an eerily discordant musical soundtrack appeared to recall the news everyone was valiantly trying to forget.

Fuzzy teddy bear-style wool was seen on bomber jackets, overcoats, even pants and shorts, while an oversize quilted, double-faced puffer coat was just what the doctor ordered in these trying times.

It even looked as if it could double as a sleeping bag.

And for those who like fashion loud and in your face, Roberto Cavalli presented on Wednesday night a theatrical collection of what designer Fausto Puglisi called ""cage dresses"", with bands of fabric barely covering strategic parts of the torso, together with the label's signature over-the-top animal prints.

Cheetah bodysuits. Faux reptile capes. Leopard, leather, and fringe together -- what's not to love when the world is falling apart?

Lush mohair bodices in jewel tones of emerald combined with high leather collars, straps and metal rings -- as if a naughty Elizabethan princess suddenly found herself in the dungeon.

Fashion show usher Alessandro Vailatti said he thought no one should be ashamed at feeling uplifted by the flights of fancy on display.

""It's important that we distract ourselves.""

"Feb 24, 2022","Skirts get shorter, bodies are stripped, and curves are revealed… From Fendi to Marco Rambaldi to Diesel, designers seem to enjoy undressing women, judging by the ready-to-wear collections presented on Wednesday during the first day of Milan Fashion Week. Could this be an effect of global warming? What is certain is that the Fall/Winter 2022-23 season looks hotter than ever.
 Fendi’s models may have donned long, glamorous cashmere gloves and wrapped themselves in cozy fur jackets while sporting fun, colorful furry handbags, but they looked fresh out from their boudoir. Wearing impalpable outfits in delicate shades of powdered pink or sage green, their hair was still damp and pinned back with girly barrettes. Strapless jumpsuits, tops, pants, and skirts with ruffled edges were cut in a sheer chiffon fabric, sometimes printed with the O'Lock monogram or geometric patterns taken from the brand’s 1986 Spring/Summer collection.
 
Creative director Kim Jones clashed these prints with ""the diaphanous light of Fall/Winter 2000,"" another collection by Karl Lagerfeld from which he also drew inspiration to build a contradicting wardrobe. Lingerie sets gave way to a series of corseted and more structured tweed pieces, clinging to the body while reshaping it.Short lengths persist throughout his collection. Mini strapless dresses, blouse-hugging corset tops, tiny Prince of Wales shorts, pants, and cropped jackets were sometimes paired with chiffon tops, as were certain leather and denim pieces, and enhanced with an asymmetrical sarong-like belt to better accentuate the thighs. For the evening, the Fendi muse walks out wearing only a sheer black jumpsuit under her fur coat and nothing else.  
The mood was later changed drastically by Marco Rambaldi, where male and female bodies of all forms wearing seductive ultra-tight and openwork knitwear, printed transparent tulle jumpsuits, and butt-grazing skirts were freely exposed.

A sensual theme was especially exacerbated throughout the collection in which the designer chose Italian porn stars of the 80s and 90s as muses, such as Cicciolina and Moana Pozzi, since “they revolutionized the position of women in society,” as he explained backstage. 
 
With their high socks and knit stockings, little heart inlays scattered everywhere, and skimpy sherbet-colored outfits (in water mint, candy pink, lilac, etc.), these ladies seemed to play the part of a mischievous childish woman. One of them even lifted her skirt up to reveal a butt tattoo.
 
Slip dresses were worn equally by male and female models, as well as shiny lurex and hot pink satin sets opened at the back by a large heart bordered with crystals. The boundaries between the two sexes were certainly blurred to the point of confusion. In addition, Marco Rambaldi’s signature crochet was ever-present in cardigans, miniskirts, openwork dresses, and even in a heart-shaped thong.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 24, 2022","One day after the dressed up and theatrical London season finished, Milan presented catwalks of sinful chic. Forget all the dramaturgical dressing of the UK, here in Italy they want devil-may-care damsels. 
 Diesel: Denim restorationDenim, denim and more denim, and most of it spectacularly good in the debut runway collection by Glenn Martens for Diesel, presented with gusto before five giant inflatable statues attired in jeans, the size of a trailer, all finished with Diesel logos. Denim in all its worn glory – from the barely there ragged pocket jeans worn with denim brad and the oversized matelassé hipster pants to the carved up faded patchwork cocktails worn with denim dragoon boots and the bad boy western dusters. 
 
The show opened with an Asian beauty in ragged, oversized jeans, boots and mini bra all in washed denim, showing twice as much tummy as seen in any show in London last weekend. Parkas came covered in linen or lace made to look like plaster, while over oversized coats were composed of denim residue made into a fabric that looked like the shaggiest shearling possible.
 
Glenn’s naughtiest boldest idea – the new logo miniskirts; scarcely seven inches deep, and consisting essentially of one wide Lonsdale style belt, held on by Velcro, and finished with a big sliding D logo. They came in spongy leather and, of course, denim
 
“It makes access a lot easier!” chuckled Martens, as he mocked pulling the mini off with a wiggle.
 
Presented in a giant hangar in south Milan, the show featured a cool Goldfinger moment – a trio of models in figure-hugging dyed denim suits; their legs, shoes, face and hair all in matching colors – first in rose gold, then in cooper and finally in metallic violet. Where was James Bond when you needed him?
 
Post show, Diesel patron Renzo Rosso greeted guests in an ebullient mood. Last week, his group OTB, whose biggest asset is Diesel, reported a 16.2% increase in annual revenues to 1.62 billion euros. Today, Diesel opened the Milan runway season with its strongest collection in many years.
 
“It’s been a hell of a lot of work, but we got there. It’s the New Diesel!” said an obviously delighted Renzo Rosso.
 Roberto Cavalli: From the Bourbons to bondageBondage and black roses at Cavalli, with a bodycon, full-blooded display of posh raunchy glamor by Fausto Puglisi in his second runway display for the house. 
A dozen high-end S&M looks – chopped up lycra tops and leggings worn with a naughty multi-strap minis and tough biker boots. The footwear finished with big gold metal roses. Or taught silk tops intersected with “fabric bars”, and loafers finished with more huge roses. Inspired by the porcelain boudoir of Marie Sophie of Bourbon, the last queen of Naples, who rumor had it would receive King Francis II as if he were one of her lovers.  
 
Fausto blended gold with black throughout – with a golden slip dress and choker anchored by black shoes finished with more golden metal and ceramic roses. Followed by a burnished gold biker blouson with mini skirt and tube bra.
 
Puglisi also rifled through Roberto’s DNA with gusto – sending out leopard velvet dressing gowns and matching skirts cut up the hip; or a cheetah prints bodystocking that blended into sabre-tooth heel booties.
 
And he passed through new frontiers with cool tartans, culled from classic plaids created exclusively for Queen Elizabeth. And sent out mohair mixed tartan coats and capes.
 
“I wanted to people to think about the fun they had, and to imagine all the fun they are going to have,” beamed Puglisi in the backstage of the redbrick 19th century warehouse.
 Del Core: Futurist society hostessesMilan’s new Italian couture star is the Gucci alumni Daniel Del Core, whose blend of grandeur and exoticism has made him into a must-see designer in just two years.On Wednesday, he invited a small coterie of editors and buyers into main atrium of business school Bocconi, kitted out with faux wrought iron statues, all draped in huge swathes of pale green. More like a stage set than a runway, just like the clothes, hyper theatrical looks better suited for a soon-to-be-filmed movie about futurist society hostesses.
 
Though known as a savvy colorist, most of Del Core’s opening salvo was black, and most of it very haunting.
 
A blend of art gallery owner, art collector and gallerina. The first in sculptural parkas and rose pink knit cocktails. The clients next in gorgeous jumpsuits finished with Klondike bear white diagonal stripes or billowing gold stripes dress that recalled Brâncuși sculptures. The gallerina gals in black silk brassieres, full-flowing pants, massive Jesuitical sleeves or cutaway sheathes.
 
Most looks featured Del Core’s ballooning sleeves adding a couture silhouette to cerebral ready-to-wear.
 
Ever addicted to fauna shapes, Del Core’s finale was outstanding – like the beaten golden silk caban cut like two fronds or the multi-ruffle plissé pink floral concoction sprinkled with jade. Andrea entitled the collection, Chrysalis Corrosion. Modernist bird of paradise at its best.
 Alberta Ferretti: Soft feminism with assuranceRomantic and gentle feminine style at Alberta Ferretti, who developed an enveloping silhouette to create a collection a grace and distinction. 
Though known primarily as a great dressmaker, this season the heart of the collection were Alberta’s great new double pleated volume pants in royal blue velvet or creamy steel gray cashmere. Velvet trousers in midnight blue and imperial roman purple followed, paired with faux-fur coats and Mongolian pelouche-edged capes.
 
The cast very much youthful future grand dame in their silvery lurex and wool knits, leather perfectos and velvet intarsia coats.
 
Presented in a former barracks in south Milan, the collection as far from prim. As the show climaxed with layered black chiffon mini cocktails, sparkling triangular sequined dresses and a brilliantly skimpy pewter silk plissé sheath worn with thigh boots worn by model Lineisy Montero that produced a collective murmur of awe from the audience.
 
A look that also summarized how light years apart Milan is from London. Long live the difference.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 23, 2022","Istituto Marangoni continues to expand internationally with the opening of a fashion school in Dubai. The project, which has been in the works for two years, will become a reality in October 2022 with the inauguration of the self-financed and directly operated structure in a booming market for fashion and luxury.  
""A market study made us realize that there was room for an institute like ours. There is no structured school in the region with such an articulated offer on fashion, art and interior design studies. This is an opportunity to gain a foothold in the Middle East where we can continue building our reputation in the region, which is already very strong despite not being present in the territory. The Dubai location’s long-term plan is to invest heavily on qualified education,"" Stefania Valenti, managing director of Istituto Marangoni, told FashionNetwork.com.

""This operation is part of our direct investments. We expect to breakeven in the third or fourth year. We kept the same tuition rates as in Milan, an average of €25,000 per year,"" she mentioned.The school will be located in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). It will offer a three-year fashion and design course, as well as a 12-month master's program. The diplomas will be validated by the emirate's Ministry of Education.

70% of the institution’s teachers will come from Italy while the others will be recruited locally. The new building, which should have a first class of about 50 students, will be linked with the Marangoni school in Mumbai. Students from the Mumbai campus will be able to complete their final years of studies in Dubai. Similarly, students from the new school will be able to continue their education in the group's other institutes.

The Dubai campus joins the list of Marangoni schools which includes two buildings in Milan (one dedicated to interior design) and locations in Florence, Paris, London, and Mumbai. Others include the recently inaugurated Miami campus and its Chinese grounds in Shanghai, and Shenzhen. In total, Istituto Marangoni will boast ten campuses worldwide after opening its newest property.  

In addition, Valenti announced a first hybrid online master's program scheduled to launch in June, a fusion of digital and physical learning. The Institute has also been recently increasing its collaborations and special projects with exceptional mentors, such as Massimo Giorgetti, Riccardo Grassi and Olivier Rousteing in Paris.
 
""In recent years, we have seen a very big shift towards a digital business model in the industry. Digital profiles capable of merging online and physical distribution are highly sought after as well as everything related to sustainability in the production chain,"" concluded Valenti.

"Feb 22, 2022","Far from the established runways, London Fashion Week threw up a bunch off cool surprises, from Ozwald Boateng showing off-calendar; a Clements Ribeiro come back; and debuts by an Irish tailor and a German romanticist.
 Ozwald BoatengA gala evening celebrating black influence by Ozwald Boateng, who took over the Savoy Theatre on the Strand and packed the stage with a slew of major black British music and film stars.
 
The mononymous Goldie, musical producer and DJ, sauntered about the stage in a copper silk lounge jacket, while Idris Elba took the final passage in the crispest anthracite suit with silk black shirt. Elba looked great.The show marked the first by Boateng – Savile Row’s first black tailor – in over 12 years, and began with an extended drum solo before photo montages of great black heroes – rappers, actors, politicians, sports heroes and footballers. 
 
Before a masked model appeared in one of Boateng’s signature slim-line suits whose chalk patterns appeared on the exterior. Followed by lots of silvery jumpsuits, weekend shorts and silk pajama looks for guys and girls.
 
In a mammoth co-ed show of over 100 looks, he also showed lots of deep purple sharp suits, cocktail dresses and hipster grand dame blouses.
 
“There are more people of color in the industry now then I have ever known before. I was always the only Black person in the room, for decades, and I’ve been to I don’t know how many events — like the Fashion Awards. Now it’s a wholly different experience. It’s actually quite mind boggling for me, and also exciting and great to see how the business has shifted and changed,” Boateng told the Evening Standard pre-show.
 
Back in 1995, aged only 28, Boateng established his own store on Savile Row. So his celebration of black culture which became the effective grand finale of London Fashion Week, was also a moment to reflect on the staying power of Boateng, a true fashion icon in his own right.
 Clements RibeiroUnmatched quality, multi-colored stripes and scores of chevrons at Clements Ribeiro, where designer Inacio Ribeiro unveiled his second knitwear collection since relaunching his brand last year.
 
Once again, Clements Ribeiro is manufacturing its collection with Barrie, the renowned cashmere specialist that is owned by Paraffection, the Chanel group company that acquired over a dozen specialist artisans and luxury suppliers that includes Lesage, Gossens, Massaro and Maison Michel.
 
Entirely produced in cashmere, the result is a cool collection of beautifully made tanks, cardigans, jumpers and twinsets, with the entry level price 400 pounds for a tank.
 
“Working with Barrie has been a great experience. The quality is second to none. And they know how to handle bright graphic colors, which is what Clements Ribeiro is all about,” explained Brazilian-born Inacio.
 
Presented inside 14 Cavendish Square, a delightfully wrecked grand mansion, and the scene in December of Dior Men’s pre-show cocktail party, the collection had an instant sense of optimism and commercial credibility. As guests sipped on bubbly, a small team of Brazilian dancers performed before the stockmen in the mansion’s upstairs drawing room.
 
Suzanne Clements met Inacio on their first day at Central Saint Martins, married in 1992 and opened their own brand in 1993. They were twice nominated as British Designer of the Year and in 2000 were named creative directors of Cacharel, significantly reviving the southern French brand during their seven-year-stint. These days, Suzanne has turned her hand to fine art, with Inacio concentrating on fashion design.
 
A skill which he still clearly commands, given the charm and style of this collection.
 
 Banshee of Savile RowA key element in London will always be about tailoring though Irish-born Banshee of Savile Row approaches the tradition with a fresh twist – creating gentlemanly bespoke tailoring for women.
 
The fledgling brand staged its first show in a Mayfair Gallery this weekend, and there was certainly plenty of posh panache about the clothes.
 
From the crimson linen suit made with a cutaway, six-button officer’s mess jacket and the soft belted rose-hued jackets to a great midnight blue velvet theatre coat and, best of all, a flawlessly draped pink seersucker suit made with a double-breasted jacket and a single-pleat pants, paired with a tuxedo shirt.
 
Jaunty and coltish, and somehow just right for the current London mood of pulling together very spruce looks.
 Johannes WarnkeOne happening new talent in London is Johannes Warnke, whose his first full collection was inspired by Wim Wenders' iconic film Wings of Desire.
 
Like Wenders, Warnke is a German, whose sense of German spiritualism wafted through this collection.
 
Presented inside a small bedroom in The Londoner Hotel in Leicester Square, Warnke’s angels poised with curvy wings, shoulder extensions and swirling ruffles.
His materials were equally original – cruelty free silk, Tencel, or recycled parachute fabrics. 
 
“I wanted that sense of mystery and romanticism that the film has. Along with the sense that you can realize your dreams,” commented the 27-year-old German.
 
Warnke has already generated plenty of attention. London’s greatest stylist – Katie Grand - shot his look book, and there’s a video in the offing.

"Feb 21, 2022","A season of empowerment on Monday, with shows by distinctive non-British designers: active professional élan at Roksanda; modernist cabaret femme fatales at Erdem and suffragette revival chic from France’s Paul & Joe. 
 Roksanda: From Rothschild to FilaA triumphant start to Monday by Roksanda, who combined graphic references to Irish artist Eva Rothschild with a brilliant collaboration with sportswear giant Fila into a great show.Hard to recall a more exciting partnership of high fashion and active sports-style than Roksanda’s brilliant voluminous puffer coats and blankets; techy dresses and fantastic moon-boots. Definitely the must-have items for next winter’s après ski cocktails and soirées.
 
“Sports is so present today, all around us. So I wanted to combine that with elements of couture to reflect what I am about,” the designer explained post-show.Presented inside the main hall of Tate Britain, which featured several large frame sculptures by Rothschild; their colors echoed in several looks within this fall/winter 2022/23 collection. In particular, one fabulous graphic patchwork, multi-hued gown that had a real wow factor.
 
Roksanda also extended her range with some classy overalls; multi-stripe at multi-angles jackets; magnificent gents’ coats with quilted in-lays; and black satin gowns with golden metallic bar inserts. Most everything was great in this performance, including the Dear Frances two-tone, patent leather boots.
 
One needs to be a tall lady to carry off Roksanda’s volume, but if you have the self-confidence then this style is tremendously empowering. Adding to the ethereal moment, the cast had graphic double line eyeliner, in some great work by make-up artist Miranda Joyce.
 
But, above all, this show will be remembered for taking the concept of a sporty collab’ to a new level.
 Erdem: Expressionism in Sadler’s WellsDivine entre deux guerres-decadence from Erdem, in the latest beautiful collection from Erdem Moralioglu inspired by the 1930s. 
Referencing female photographers and artists, like Madame d’Ora, an Austrian fashion and portrait photographer, and recalling that German women were finally able to vote in 1919. 
 
All set in a giant black box within Sadler’s Wells, where a lone pianist on a grand piano serenaded the cast, in a room so dark it was unfortunately quite difficult to actually see the clothes.
 
A cabaret style event, with the whiff of thirties Berlin, thanks to the revamped flapper dresses made with glistening sequins, a myriad of fringes and elongated waistlines. Finished with sequin scarves; pearl-crusted brogues and long silver studded gloves.
 
“I've loved the swoosh of a sequin on a cocktail dress, since childhood,” joked Erdem backstage, after a particularly brilliant display. 
 
But there was nothing retro about these clothes, as Erdem placed pearl-beaded nylon brassieres over bugle-beaded dresses and great micro plissé cocktails; or topped cascading lace layer frocks with metallic mesh aviator helmets.
 
A collection also clearly influenced by Erdem’s recent launch of a menswear collection, as it included several great mohair men’s style double-breasted coats. Several looks were simply the menswear tailoring on female models.
 
“After doing menswear I was thinking about the extreme of femininity and masculinity placed together. And also looking at Fortuny, and the whole idea of hand embroidered dresses,” said Erdem, a patron of Sadler’s Wells.
 Paul & Joe: Suffragette chicLeave it to a French house to recall Emmeline Pankhurst and women’s fight for the right to vote. Seen in an emancipating series of clothes that retained a very at ease lady-like approach.“Gentle woman farmer,” commented designer Sophie Mechaly of her smart marriage of French insouciance and sturdy English style. 
 
Blouses finished with the high Victorian collars and necklines that Pankhurst favored; sensible top coats and sturdy tartan suits made of wide-pleated skirts under schoolmarm’s cloak/blouses.
 
Though, as Paul & Joe is a Paris label, both the boys and girls in this co-ed show wore knit berets. The ladies also fitted out in white tights and platform brogues – a huge trend here.
 
Though, the clothes were fundamentally optimistic, they also had a certain elegant gravitas given that their inspiration was the single most important individual in the electoral emancipation of 20th  century women. And one who paid a high price, being arrested seven times, and spending six weeks in prison, which she famously described as “like a human being in the process of being turned into a wild beast.”
 
Even as she leavened in plenty of wit, like the joyfully naïve prints by artist Zoe Hawk, which looked great when seen before the aged brick red cloister of Charterhouse, a storied Harry Potter-worthy school first built in 1601.
 
A show that also included the return to menswear of Paul & Joe, designed by Mechaly’s son Adrien Albou. The scion playing with similar themes, from his sailor-neck cardigans and wide-leg corduroy pants to moss green velvet suits and dapper rockstar velvet tuxedo suit in a chain link pattern.
 
All told, a great second runway foray into London by a savvy French brand. 
 Preen: Dancehall sweetheartsNo doubt about it, Preen staged a great modern ballet performance choreographed by Monique Jonas, so good it often overshadowed the clothes.Presented inside the techno/house club Heaven, practically underneath Charing Cross station, whose speakers shook all the bench seats upon which sat the pampered editors and buyers. 
 
The ballet dancers pirouetting, spasmodically jumping and gyrating as if in pain, as they danced around the small club with a mammoth system.
 
When it came to the actual clothes, the key element was lace; an idea telegraphed by the show program, an image of books, one of which was The Dead Girl in a Lace Dress by Jeanne Hyvrard. Lace seen in everything from black body-stockings and pink tutus to revealing lingerie femme fatales looks and flamenco dresses. 
 
Despite the thundering soundtrack, there was even a moment of grace – when two offbeat debutantes, naughty versions of Pride and Prejudice, performed a romantic duet.
 
Preen’s designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi also sent out bold floral layered plissé gowns – a huge London trend – puffers with watercolor prints trimmed with mini ruffles and for guys, ruffled flamenco trousers.
 
The overriding memory of this show, however, will be the funky fox-trot and not the fashion.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2022","From jogging outfits to summer dresses, Lea Baecker has stitched together most of her wardrobe herself from inside her London flat, part of a burgeoning number of young amateur seamstresses.Like many others in the growing horde of sew-it-yourself enthusiasts, she has grown increasingly disillusioned with the retail clothing industry, viewing it as too destructive.

""My main motivation was not having to buy ready-to-wear clothes anymore because I didn't want to support fast fashion,"" Baecker, 29, told AFP, referring to clothes made and sold cheaply to be thrown away after minimal use.The doctoral student in neuroscience only started sewing in 2018, beginning with small bags before moving on to clothes.

Four years on, she estimates about 80 percent of clothes in her wardrobe are homemade, from pyjamas to long fleece coats, as well as jeans made with denim scraps scalped from relatives.

Baecker now buys new clothes ""very rarely"", she added, wearing one of her self-made long, hand-sewn dresses.

- 'Scale' -

The fashion and textile industry is the third most polluting sector globally after food and construction, accounting for up to 5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2021 report by the World Economic Forum.

Low-cost fashion retailers are regularly criticised for their waste and pollution, as well as the pay conditions imposed on their workers.

Tara Viggo knows fast fashion only too well, having worked in the industry for 15 years as a pattern maker.

""I realised the scale that the fashion industry was working at and it was a bit terrifying,"" she told AFP.

In 2017, Viggo decided to start creating her own patterns -- the blueprint drawings on paper before garments are made.

She started out small, selling only around one set of patterns per year, a far cry from the four a day that she would sometimes churn out in the ready-to-wear industry.

Viggo conceded independent operators like her were only tiny competitors to the big brands, but insisted they still could have a meaningful impact.

""The more of us that do (it), the better,"" she said.

""It's like a trigger... People start to look at where their consumption"" is, she added noting it also made you aware of the true costs involved.

""Once you know how to sew your own clothes, you can't fathom that a shirt should be £3 ($4.10, 3.60 euros) anymore.""

- 'More young people' -

Viggo's ""Zadie"" jumpsuit is now a top seller on ""The Fold Line"", an online platform selling independently produced sewing patterns, according to its co-founder Rachel Walker.

Since its launch in 2015, the website has grown from about 20 designers to more than 150 today.

Rosie Scott and Hannah Silvani, who run a London workshop selling fabrics from fashion designers' unsold stock, have also seen the resurgence in sewing's popularity, particularly among young people.

""The clients have changed,"" said Scott.

""More young people have shown interest in sewing -- young people who are really interested in making their own clothes and making them sustainably.""

Women make up more than 90 percent of the clientele, she also noted.

Customers can choose from some 700 designer fabrics, sold from £8 a metre for cotton voile -- a sheer, lightweight cotton fabric -- to £110 for the same length of lace.

Orders soared during the pandemic and are still going strong despite the lifting of restrictions, Scott said.

- Instagram key -

The sector's explosive growth would not have been possible without Instagram, where the sewing community has made a pastime once seen as unfashionable much more trendy.

The photo-sharing platform ""is really important"", Baecker said, allowing sewists to post images of their designs and engage with each other.

This is what prompted her to join the social network, where she now regularly shares her latest works.

""I found each pattern has a specific hashtag that you can look up and then you can see a lot of different people wearing the same pattern and you can imagine how it can look on yourself,"" she explained.

For example, Viggo's #Zadiejumpsuit -- which comes in velvet or cotton, with or without sleeves -- has been tagged in almost 11,000 posts.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #handmadewardrobe features in more than 900,000 posts.

With Baecker sharing so many of her creations, she has also inspired friends to join the growing sewing revolution.

""That is my proudest achievement... getting my friends into sewing as well,"" she said.

"Feb 21, 2022","D'oh! Who would have thought it? The Simpsons, a middle-class American family on screens for more than three decades, seem to have scaled new heights in recent months, to the point of becoming fashion icons. Not content with acting as models for the Balenciaga fashion house, the Springfield residents are now increasingly inspiring the most prominent brands.From a fashion show in Paris, to luxury clothes and sneakers, never in more than three decades has the Simpson family made so many incursions into the world of fashion, or, by extension, been so stylish. The show's most rebellious child, who once had a penchant for showing his butt cheeks, now even has fashion collections in his name.

Inspiring NikeIndeed, the Swoosh brand is set to release a new pair of sneakers inspired by Bart. Unveiled by the Sneaker News Instagram account, rather than by Nike, the SB Dunk Low -- which make the brand's name in the world of skateboarding -- are now landing in a trio of colors: yellow, orange, and blue, echoing the colors of Bart's skin, T-shirt, shorts and shoes. The sneakers should be released soon, although no date has yet been announced.

And this isn't the first time that the family has inspired Nike. Parents Homer and Marge have also had sneakers in their colors, based on the SB Dunk, Low and High versions, respectively, and all of which evidently met with success. It's enough to give fashion houses ideas... Then came adidas, which a few months ago presented the ""Simpsons X Adidas McCarten 'Left-Handers Rule.'"" Here, against all odds, it's not a member of the family who is honored with a sneaker style, but their closest neighbor, Ned Flanders, whose outfit directly inspired the shoe's design.

Then, there's the latest announcement from Levi's, just a few days ago, explaining that ""something big is coming soon"" with a video teasing ""The Simpsons x Levi's."" Sweatshirts, T-shirts, denim jackets, corduroy pants and bucket hats seem to be on the agenda in a high-profile collaboration combining pop culture and streetwear, which could be released in the coming weeks.

Balenciaga opens the door to luxury

Ever at the cutting edge, the Balenciaga fashion house has clearly set the tone, while also kicking off a host of partnerships with the Springfield family. For the presentation of its spring-summer 2022 collection, Demna Gvasalia, the luxury brand's artistic director, dropped a previously unseen episode of the famous series, in which he appears for the first time. Laced with the usual dose of humor -- and satire -- the family members arrive in Paris to walk the runway in front of an array of stars, including Anna Wintour.

A few days after airing the episode, which now has more than 9 million views on Balenciaga's YouTube channel, the luxury brand presented a ""The Simpsons"" collection for adults and children, which also proved a great success. Now, after more than 30 years of fame in their hometown, The Simpsons seem ready to conquer the world!

"Feb 21, 2022","Milan Fashion Week starts this Tuesday evening until Monday, February 28 with an explosive program succeeding the New York and London fashion weeks. Presenting 10 to 20 physical shows per day, scattered throughout the city, the women’s ready-to-wear Fall/Winter 2022-23 season is back to its pre-pandemic frenzy as if nothing had happened. After two pandemic-ridden years, a strong return of buyers and journalists from all over the world, except for China, is also expected. Nearly 170 events have been announced, compared to just over 200 in its more successful years. 67 fashion shows (of which 2 are hybrid, 57 in-person, and eight in digital format), 77 presentations and nine special events are on the schedule. There are additionally several fashion shows and presentations that are outside of the official calendar. More than 90% of the shows are concentrated in the span of five days, from Wednesday to Sunday.

""It is true that we don’t have many days compared to Paris and the density of the program. We would ideally like to have an extra day, but the buyers are reluctant. We try to be synthetic by satisfying everyone,"" said president of the Camera della Moda (CNMI), Carlo Capasa. ""Everyone wants to come to Milan! The demand for fashion shows is more than double that of the current calendar. With its 800 showrooms, the city is like an open-air fair. Even the big fashion houses that showcase elsewhere have their showrooms here. People come here to do business,"" he added.On the program are of course the “Made in Italy” stars: Fendi and Roberto Cavalli will parade on Wednesday followed by Max Mara, Prada and Moschino on Thursday. Missoni, Etro, and Versace on Friday, Dolce & Gabbana on Saturday, and Giorgio Armani on Sunday. The lineup is only missing Antonio Marras, who chose to take his show to Moscow this season but will nevertheless organize a presentation in Milan. The Italian fashion capital can count, however, on the return of a slew of big names that had deserted its catwalks in recent seasons: Gucci, Bottega Veneta (revealing Matthieu Blazy’s first collection for the brand), Plein Sport, and Dsquared2, which is again presenting its menswear and womenswear separately during their designated weeks.

Trussardi will unveil Serhat Isik and Benjami A. Huseby’s very first collection as new creative directors of the brand on Saturday, the creatives who additionally head the German avant-garde label, GmbH. Ennio Capasa, founder of Costume National, will also mark his comeback on Tuesday evening with the debut of his new brand, Capasa Milano. Other highlights for this week include Diesel’s first fashion show in the Lombardy capital under its new creative director, Glenn Martens, and Ferrari’s presentation of its first ever high-end fashion line led by designer Rocco Iannone.
 
The spotlight will also shine on the week’s cohort of new names, including the very cool Japanese label, Ambush, which launched in 2008 by American-Korean designer, Yoon Ahn together with her partner Verbal (Japanese DJ, producer, and hip-hop star) who usually present their collections in Paris but opted for a change of scenery this season. Another noteworthy entrant to the women’s edition of fashion week is Franceco Ragazzi’s high-end streetwear brand, Palm Angels, which up until now would showcase its collections during the men’s week. Both brands are part of Farfetch’s brand portfolio of its New Guards Group. Both brands are part of the New Guards Group, Farfetch’s production and distribution holding company. 
 
Another newcomer worth checking out is AC9, the brand launched in September 2019 by Alfredo Cortese. With a degree in chemistry and a passion for photography, the Sicilian discovered fashion while working in public relations for Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s N°21, and who later went on to create a capsule collection for the brand. His fluid style with a Nordic rigor, crossed with a sexy Mediterranean flavor, was quickly appreciated and is currently distributed by Tomorrow London.
 
British-Nigerian Ineyie Tokyo James, who has just been selected for the LVMH Prize semi-finals, also embarked on a similar, atypical career path. After graduating from Queen Mary University of London in mathematics, he branched out into a career as a fashion stylist, working for various international publications and brands, directing digital campaigns for the likes of Brioni, Iseey Miyake, and Puma Black Label. In 2015, he launched the monthly digital publiciation, Rough UK, and moved to Lagos, where he founded his eponymous brand Tokyo James. After presenting his past collections in London, his experimentative and bold creations joined the Milanese men’s calendar in January 2021. After graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, Andrea Adamo worked for Elisabetta Franchi, Roberto Cavalli, Zuhair Murad and Dolce & Gabbana, before taking the plunge in September 2020 with the launch of his own brand Andreādamo. The label has established itself these past few seasons as a must-have for sexy and comfortable knitwear. Equally passionate about knitewear, Jezabelle Cormio will debut on the Milanese catwalks on Sunday. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Antwerp, she collaborated with various brands before founding her maison, Cormio, in 2019 with a first collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21. She draws inspiration from the Austrian-Tyrolean world to create playful garments with unexpected details using experimental knitting techniques.
 
The newcomer Aniye Records will also debut this season, unveiling 70 music-inspired looks designed as concert costumes on Sunday. The designer, Alessandra Marchi, grew up in the fashion industry as her father and uncle, Vannis and Marco Marchi, are none other than the owners of the Liu Jo group. In 2000, Alessandra founded the Aniye By line in Carpi, offering rock-inspired clothing for unconventional women. Her new label will be distributed by Riccardo Grassi with the goal of reaching 100 top multi-brand retailers worldwide in its first season.

This week will be the opportunity to finally discover Onitsuka Tiger (Asics fashionable little sister brand) and the futuristic Danish house, Hans Kjøbenhavn, in the real world through their first physical runway shows in Milan, despite having participated through digital presentations since 2020. 

British outerwear brand, Husky, owned by the Moschillo group, will mark its debut on the fashion show calendar but in digital format. As for the presentations, there are a number of new names: winner of the “Who is on next” 2020 competition Francesco Murano, Luciano Padovan, the London-based South Korean brand Miss Sohee (who will be hosted in the spaces of Dolce & Gabbana), Balestra, Durazzi (digitally), Cukovy, Andrea Incontri, Ramzen, Bloke, Sa Su Phi, Edoardo Gallorin, Tu Lizè and Vaishali S.
 
This stimulating Milan Week will also be an opportunity to discover new cultural venues in the metropolis, such as the new epicenter of Fashion Week, the ADI Design Museum in Via Ceresio. The National Chamber of Italian Fashion is moving its Fashion Hub and its many projects dedicated to sustainable and emerging labels to this location this season. Another notable venue is Mudec, a cultural hub dedicated to the world's diverse cultures in the Tortona district. It will host highly creative research collections selected by White Milano for the first time as part of its ""Beyond the Norm"" initiative from February 24 to 27.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2022","A poignant day of shows in London on Sunday, where 16 Arlington staged the last collection by the late Federica Cavenati, and Simone Rocha unveiled her collection inside the Great Hall at The Honourable Society of Lincolns Inn.
 Simone RochaIrish designer Simone Rocha took her latest ideas into the Great Hall at The Honourable Society of Lincolns Inn, one of the Inns of Court, dating back to 1422, on Sunday night and the jury’s decision is in: she just had another hit collection.
 
Presented in semi-darkness and underneath giant stain glass windows, this was a somber display by Rocha, a work of extreme fashion assemblage and brilliantly bold proportions. 
Frequently, re-assembling her favored elements, white cotton Victorian frocks; massive ruffles; punky biker jackets; oodles of taffeta and lots of pearls.
 
“Two sons and two daughters. A dark lament. Crushed taffeta wings, and exploration of outerwear and what lies beneath. Bloodline and quilted blankets. Bitter sequins, blue velvet,” proffered Simone, in her latest lapidary program notes.However, Rocha did break plenty of new ground with semi-sheer lingerie dresses worn over micro cable sweaters cut-off like a bra, and paired with black stockings trimmed with pearls. Adding in a naughtier, racier touch to Rocha’s romanticism.
 
Many of her models appearing in pearl trimmed balaclavas, their hair finished with enormous, floor scraping braids. Often marching on all-white platform sneakers that looked made of plaster of Paris.
 
Backed up by the best soundtrack of London so far, with a marvelous Sinead O’Connor remix courtesy of sound architect, Frédéric Sanchez.

All told, the most elegiac yet also coolly deranged collection of London so far, which the Grand Jury of front row of fashion greeted with thundering applause.
 16ArlingtonThere wasn’t a dry eye in the audience at 16Arlington when designer Marco Capaldo took his bow, after presenting the final collection on which he and his late partner Federica ‘Kikka’ Cavenati had both created.
 In December, Cavenati died after a sudden illness, fortune’s cruel hand ending the career of a very talented designer, who already at the age of 28 had created a special and particular fashion vision.
 
A standing ovation greeting Capaldo after showing a fall collection that captured all that is distinctive about 16Arlington’s cool take on modern glamor. Its key material the micro sequin, used skillfully in snug boleros, tanks, ankle-length columns and even sequined clogs.
 
Thoroughly sexy but never overly saucy, from the off-the-shoulder bustiers to the micro suede minis worn with funnel-sleeved Elizabethan knit jackets and knee socks.
 
Though the most memorable ideas were the snazzy tie-dye stretch tops, flared pants and mini cardigans; along with great moiré velvets jackets and suits. Also impressing were the languid, boyfriend’s pantsuits, cut with admirable volume, and finished with elegant miniature spidery beading.
 
The cast balanced on studded platform clogs as they toured Yeomanry House in Bloomsbury, to the mordant electronic music of Logarithmic Spiral.
 
Before Capaldo appeared to a standing ovation, a terribly sad finale to an impressive collection, that served to remind everyone of all Kikka’s immense potential and promise.Yuhan WangThey love an eccentric in London Fashion Week, and the wackier the better, like Yuhan Wang, whose latest collection was all about the beauty of imperfection. 
 
All his materials were unpredictable. Wang sent out acres of faux leather, overprinted with huge leaves, tabby cats and kittens, much of it perforated. Everything jumbled up with floral jacquards and meters of lace - all the way to lace socks and boots and super shaggy faux-fur slippers. A truly eccentric fashion statement, where the best single look was a beige, faux-leather jacket, hyper perforated into a great leaf pattern, and worn over white lace tights that finished in a beige pumps – beguiling and rather beautiful.
 
A lot of looks really didn’t work – like Wang’s green knit top and hotpants over which was sewn an unfinished embroidery of a tabby cat looked daft rather than daffy. Plus, his silhouette was also mixed, and at times confused – in particular an ecru jacquard empire waist Jane Austen dress that added a half dozen kilos.
 
However, in a season of grandiose eccentricity this felt very in sync with the whole mood of London.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 20, 2022","Sneakers made from banana or pineapple leaves, dresses from nettles or fish scales -- the search for sustainable materials has taken the fashion industry to some wild places.Experts warn these new textiles are not a quick fix for fashion's enormous problems with over-consumption and waste, but may be a necessary step in developing cleaner technologies.

""You could possibly eat the final product,"" said Hannes Schoenegger, co-founder of Bananatex, which uses leaves from banana trees in the Philippines to make bags, t-shirts and a line of shoes for H&M that sold out within two hours.He was speaking at the Premiere Vision Paris conference, where industry professionals gather to find out which fabrics will dominate coming seasons.

""We only harvest the sides of the plants, and they're already growing in the forest, so no chemicals, pesticides or even water are used,"" Schoenegger added.

He was among multiple stalls presenting new bio-sourced materials.

Brazil-based Nova Kaeru offered leather made from the discarded scales of the giant pirarucu fish and another from the tropical ""elephant ear"" plant.

Nearby, Ananas Anam showed off some Nike shoes made from waste pineapple leaves.Nettles are inThese textiles can be relatively niche, but some companies are determined to bring them into the mainstream.

Spanish firm Pyratex offers multiple options, from recycling the waste of corn and sugarcane production, to making fibres from Icelandic seaweed, Chinese bamboo or Austrian wood.

""It's not about replacing cotton with one alternative crop. It's about finding a wide variety of substitutes to make sure that nothing is over-used,"" said spokesperson Pilar Tejada Lopez.

One plant getting particular interest is the nettle, which can be turned into a silk-like and incredibly strong fabric that can be used in everyday and luxury clothing.

It highlights the fact that many of these technologies are not new.

""Nettles have actually been used for clothing for centuries, but we have largely forgotten,"" said Lopez.

""Part of our job is reintroducing these ideas that have been lost.""Natural limitsOthers warn of over-reliance on new materials in the drive towards sustainability.

""Replacement materials serve no purpose if we continue to make the same amount of clothing,"" said Victoire Satto, of The Good Goods, a media firm specialising in responsible fashion.

They could even add to the problem if scaled up by encouraging further deforestation to make way for newly fashionable plants, she said.

That is why companies like Bananatex refuse to go beyond natural farming limits.

""Our project is part of a reforestation programme, a good way of revitalising soils and providing work to local families,"" said Schoenegger.

""There's a natural limit and we won't go beyond that, because then it would be harmful.""

Pyratex similarly puts a lot of emphasis on partnering with responsible farmers, and avoiding the ultra-complex supply chains that make it difficult for clothing companies to know who grows their raw materials and in what conditions.

But Satto says more research is also needed on the durability of bio-sourced materials, since half the ecological damage from an item of clothing is linked to its disposal.

""If the product only lasts six months, that's enormous in terms of environmental impact,"" she said.IterationsIfeanyi Okwuadi, an award-winning British designer, says his focus is on how clothes are made -- not what they are made from.

""When I speak about sustainability, I'm talking about the construction -- right down to using the right stitch-length for each stitch because that kind of minute detail affects the longevity of the garment when you put it in the wash,"" he said.

He says many bio-sourced materials are still evolving.

""Right now, there's a lot of buzzwords to draw you in, but eventually we won't need to say it's from bananas or whatever -- it will just be plant-based fibres.""

""I don't use them in my work because the tech at the moment is quite primitive. But I see them as iterations, like with all technology, and we need these innovations.""

"Feb 20, 2022","A busy and blustering Saturday in London Fashion Week where a duo of young women designers - Nensi Dojaka and Molly Goddard - issued striking fashion manifestos in two powerful shows.
 
In a day and season that marked a yearning for a far more put together look, notably at Eudon Choi and Eftychia.
 Nensi DojakaThe day opened with Nensi Dojaka, the most recent winner of the LVMH Prize, whose latest expression of innerwear as outerwear was concise and cool. 
Devoid of any prints and made in a monochromatic palette of black, flesh, dark rose and rust – the collection had tremendous polish and precision. Last September, her debut show in London, staged a week after she won LVMH’s award, was something of an anti-climax, since most of the collection was made of looks she had already shown to win the award.
 
Not this morning in this show, staged in semi darkness inside the nerve center of the London season, a disused concrete storage space known as the Old Selfridges Hotel.Dojaka also revealed herself to be a fine tailor, cutting spruce fresh suits and blazers finished with padded back belts and worn with refined semi-sheer bustiers in blends of silk, stretch and chiffon. 
 
While her holed stretch lycra cocktails interspersed with mesh and finished with thin straps all looked great on the plus-sized models in an inclusive casting. All of whom had to carefully dodge past a faintly crazy steadicam operator who filmed the whole show walking up and down the catwalk.
 
Dojaka skillfully broke new ground with some tough chic zippered tunics and a perfectly cut mini puffer for clubbing. Like most of her looks finished with strings, straps and tags. Though the heart of the matter were the lingerie dresses, a tricky balancing act, which Nensi delicately addresses – to make clothes that are sexy and suggestive, without ever being cheap.
 
“I wanted to extend the wardrobe and make my woman and her universe more complete. My first outerwear, more wintery fabrics, and a wider concept of what this woman can be,” explained Dojaka, who greeted her mother first in an emotional embrace backstage after the show. 
 Molly GoddardEven in a UK downpour, there are few sunnier moments in the London season than Molly Goddard, the reigning champion of cool eccentricity.
 
Harking back to the London markets in the 80s and 90s, and inspired by her mum’s best friend, whom Goddard recalled as a “cross between Marilyn Monroe and Mick Jones.""The result was a collection that had all the glamorous kick and rock'n'roll attitude one associates with the street markets of Portobello and Camden.
 
Marching on a white elevated catwalk inside a fantastic light-filed 1930s modernist art deco leisure center. The cast appeared in Molly’s signature big bustling silhouette. Starring twisting tulle gowns paired with army surplus jackets or the best knits in London. Fab' cable sweaters; mock aran cardigans; grandads striped pullovers and sequined covered chenille tops.
 
Though the most beautiful looks were the body con flamenco dresses finished in acres of puckered tulle from the waist down. Just a couple of prints, though great ones: a fairy tale of cherubs attempting to jump on a bucking horse; or a floral rose seen on a great frayed aristocratic rock goddess denim dress worn over a red top.
 
An overall look often completed with tulle covered bags with metal chain straps or bowling sneakers.
 
Goddard has been showing men and women together for several seasons, and generally the guys appear in the same fabrics, colors and kilts one finds on the girls. Argyle type sweaters, fabric bags, rose-printed denim, and even the aforementioned naïve kid’s print.
 
Remembering mother’s pal as “big bleached blonde hair with a flower in it, red lipstick, a 50s dress with an army jacket and trainers,” Goddard whipped up a great collection and show, after two years of videos shot inside white box art galleries.

Few designers in Britain are as worthy of a great show space as Goddard, whose oeuvre is the most instantly recognizable of her generation. Quite a feat if you think about it. 
 Eudon ChoiMichelangelo Antonioni has been inspiring fashion designers for the past half century and the latest expression was in east London at Eudon Choi.
 
Presented inside the early 17th century Charterhouse, whose outside park as littered with broken branches from Storm Eunice. Entering this Harry Potter-like territory, the collection riffed on Red Desert, Antonioni’s brilliant tale of existentialist angst.One suspects Michelangelo would have been pleased with the results – especially the all-red opening. Whether the refined rosso corsa oversized six-pocket coat or the crimson silk matching pants and blouse or the beautifully draped barn red society hostess satin rippling cocktail – sensational when seen before the aged red brick walls.
 
Choi has innate good taste, seen in the self-assurance with which he blends ribbed woolen jumpers with raffia and frayed cotton mini-skirts or khaki pants. Everything looked very spruce and empowering. 
 
Add in a series of sculptural bags in abstract shapes of flowerpots and bell jars, courtesy of a link-up with Louis Quatorze, and you have a smart and optimistic fashion statement.Eftychia 
The heart of the matter at Eftychia was the soft, yet somber tailoring, from a designer known for creating stylish office work wear. 
This season, designer Eftychia Karamolegkou – an ex-intern of Mary Katrantzou and Antonio Marras - concentrated on the classic tuxedo, though finishing them all with velvet trim and stripes – often down the front pleat rather than the side. She’s also a stylish tailor, cutting flattering pants suits in fine wools.
 
Plus, Eftychia knows how to use felty wool, notably in some finely shaped funnel neck boleros. Working with a late-night color palette of anthracite, mud and steely gray, she also showed some fine velvet dresses for evening.

"Feb 19, 2022","London Fashion Week kicked off its five-day hybrid schedule on Friday, with a return to pre-pandemic normalcy still far from being achieved, and with Brexit still a challenge, said Caroline Rush, director of the British Fashion Council (BFC), to AFP. Still, digital runway presentations have been embraced as a creative and commercial opportunity for many brands, and hybrid presentations could be here to last.

What can we expect of fashion week in London after two very difficult years?Caroline Rush: This week, we are delighted to welcome runway presentations that will once again embrace a hybrid format with some 60 digital presentations and 50 in-person ones. There is a real appetite for a face-to-face experience and I look forward to seeing an international audience return. We are clearly not back to normal, but this is progress from where we were in September and September was already an improvement (compared to the peak of the pandemic when Fashion Week had to be cancelled, editor’s note).

We won’t have people from many Asian countries who are still not able to travel, but there are representatives from the U.K. here, so you can still do business and see the collections, and buying online is something that people have gotten used to.

I don’t know if we’ll go back to where we were before. The need to move to digital runway presentations has inspired many creators over the past two years and it is now up to them to decide how they want to show their work. Many of them may decide to do a in-person runway presentation in February and a digital one in September, truly embracing the hybrid model.

What has been the impact of the pandemic and Brexit?

CR: It’s been two very difficult years. The pandemic has hit everyone in the industry, digital sales (surged) and the way we buy has changed.

The Covid-19 supply chain crisis has been a real challenge. Some designers can’t show their collection because there’s been an outbreak of cases in their factory. It’s hard to produce a collection in time, but it’s getting better.

Brexit continues to be a challenge for the fashion industry, whether it’s tariffs, paperwork, visas for people to work in different countries. We have an active dialogue with the government. Of course, free trade agreements have been signed and we want to ensure that the fashion industry is at the centre of discussions, and that the difficulties and lessons of Brexit are taken into account. But we are optimistic — we have incredible designers, innovation and creativity, and that continues to resonate around the world.”

The fashion industry has been heavily criticized in recent months for its negative environmental impact...

CR: We will talk a lot (during Fashion Week) about sustainability. As an industry, we know we have an impact on the planet. We’ve made commitments to really think about how we can move to more circular fashion in the UK. Designers have really been at the forefront of this transition, and new talent is very keen to create sustainably-oriented businesses. We have to think about the materials we us, but for that we need infrastructures to collect and recycle (old clothes).

Designers and companies are thinking in terms of resale and repair to extend the life of a garment, but we do not necessarily have the mechanical and chemical recycling infrastructure in the United Kingdom. This represents a tremendous opportunity for the country to create skills and jobs.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Feb 18, 2022","As Fashion Month continues, designers are increasingly diving deep into tech innovation and the latest to do so is Edward Crutchley.Showing his AW22 menswear and womenswear collections on the first day of London Fashion Week on Friday, he also showcased an industry first collaboration with Augmented Reality platform Zero10, allowing digital replicas of two catwalk looks to be worn on-screen in full 3D as soon as they were shown.

Crutchley said he’s worked with 3D rendering in the past “but [Zero10’s] expertise and commitment to digital craft really took the process to the next level. I really believe that this is how fashion will exist, with digital and physical fashion both being equally valid as the artisan craft of the future”.The company said that the “world-first allows users to wear and share items from the catwalk in real-time in full 3D using Zero10’s innovative blend of body tracking, segmentation, fabric simulation and rendering technology which allows materials to look and move realistically offering the most accurate digital representation of physical clothes in the market”.

Crutchley has always been know for being open to new ideas in materials and technology and the company added that the link-up with Zero10 is a “showcase for how the metaverse offers an environment for designers to execute what could previously only be dreamed of, more comprehensively realise their creative vision, and still make this instantly available to their audience in a cost-effective and zero-waste way”.

But it also stressed that it’s not about leaving craftsmanship behind: “This collaboration puts craftsmanship first and raises the technique, touch and talent of behind-the-scenes digital creators in the studio to the role of artisans. Each item requires over 40 hours of labour to produce, echoing the atelier through detail, finish, and flair of execution at the heart of the separation between ten-a-penny digital garments, and something elevated towards true luxury”.

Anton Grigoriev, Head of Design at Zero10, added that he wants to quash the assumption around digital creations that they’re purely technical items created for practical purposes. “This couldn’t be further from the truth,” he explained. “From ideation to realisation the process requires immense creativity to overcome to properties of the source material much like any other art form, just that our source material is code rather than cotton, canvas, or clay. Careful handling of the process with an artistic touch can create digital items which are highly sensitive and full of emotion, which can be aggressive or soft, delicate, or robust, euphoric”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 18, 2022","Storm Eunice hit England this Friday, in a red warning opening day of London Fashion Week, where the first important show was by Edward Crutchley. 
A gale of gothic imagery and a downpour of dandy decadence on the runway from Crutchley, one of important voices on the London fashion scene.
 
Gender-bending throughout in a collection presented in a battered old attic in the Bargehouse on the banks of the Thames. Over the next five days, LFW will witness almost 40 live runway shows, and even more presentations spread across the UK capital, as editors and buyers finally return in large numbers to physical shows.In a great opening salvo from Crutchley, one witnessed a blend of perforated body-con, Tudor magnificence and artful androgyny. 
 
Few designers anywhere know their fashion history better than Edward, who has an uncanny ability to mash-up disparate eras into cool and often beautiful clothes.
 
Combining a perfectly cut boyfriend’s modernist white double-breasted coat in duffle weave wool with a black Edwardian doeskin coat worn as a skirt for a wonderfully mysterious image. Or a flawless duffle weave wool  blazer worn with a velvet and viscose tube skirt – the ideal blend of edge and elegance.  Everything in interesting textiles, not so surprisingly as Crutchley’s other job is developing fabrics for Dior Men with Kim Jones.
 Crutchley tried a little of everything, showing off his range – from a great moth-wing broken-pattern mohair elongated cardigan to recycled polyester gigot-sleeved bodice worn with a va-va-voom warp skirt – talk about a pulse quickener – to a glamorous long-lapel menswear suit and voluminous pants in the softest lilac. The sort of look Saint Laurent might have dreamed up had he attended Central Saint Martin’s.
 
And, just when the action got a little too polite, too bourgeois, Edward sent out a bearded, dyed blonde dude with a body to rival Thor in a chopped-up knit leotard, knickers, knee socks and matching purple boots.
 
“The queerness of Gothic is such that its main function is to demonstrate the relationship between the marginal and the mainstream,” read a quote in the show’s online program Queering the Gothic, a philosophical work about reading texts through queer theories.
 
And not a bad comment on this collection, worn on coal-eyed, waxy-haired models, wearing palladium-coated triple-logo chokers, most of them accessorized with nipple clamp earrings. Over the powder-dusted wooden floor, the cast marching in distressed leather platforms finished with studs, rings and metal laces. 
 
And somehow ideal for this wild and windy Friday where Storm Eunice started ripping the roof of the shopping and entertainment O2 Center on Finchley Road.
 
 Conner Ives: Hudson Valley HotGood to see some unabashed merchandise on a London catwalk, courtesy of Conner Ives, an American who has been a LVMH Prize semi-finalist.
 
Ives was inspired this season by the Hudson Valley School, a 19th-century art movement that glorified the lush and dramatic landscapes of upstate New York. 
 
“Having grown up in the Hudson Valley I see myself as drawing from the same source of inspiration as those artists hundreds of years before me,”  explained Ives.
 
And, even if what hit the runway often seemed far from the earthy mannerist hues and bold panoramas of the art movement, the results were often extremely good. 
 
As is his wont, Ives likes to create for archetypes – and gave every one of the 26 passages a name – from the 'Stay at Home Mum' to the 'Madam Vice President'. 
 
Or the VSCO Girl who opened the show, interpreted by the ineffable Edie Campbell, in a matching yellow and white oversized caban and flat-cap paired with patent leather boots in bright red, like one of Frederic Edwin Church’s sunset vistas.
 
“Hot, cunning and toned. Plays dumb for the boys, scored 2300 in her first attempt at the SAT,” commented the designer on his VSCO Girl.
 
Otherwise, the Diana Ross-inspired burning red forest-print sweater; or the Laurel Canyon wild gal with a barely-there scarf dress and crisscross top; and a fantastic gap-year-in-Bali beauty in a perfectly draped sleeveless golden yellow dress were, well, all very youthful glamour.
 
Ives’s Big Idea is melding elements of American graphic iconography and street style with classy draping and ladylike silhouettes. It makes for a cool distinctive style, even if it the stylistic soufflé doesn’t always work. A crass red cotton dress featuring a basketball logo reading Buckeye Champions was practically a human rights offence.
 
Still, this was a punchy and sexy statement by Ives, one designer sure to make the grade in his career. Matter of fact, he already has.

"Feb 18, 2022","The Institut Français de la Mode has been invited for the second time to take part in the official fashion calendar and to open Paris Fashion Week on February 28 with a digital fashion show presenting the work of the 59 Master of Arts graduates (the fashion and image design program). The show will be presented in digital format at 4:30 p.m. (on the official Paris Fashion Week platform, like all the other events on the calendar), and will be ""an opportunity to discover the creations of young designers from more than 16 different countries,"" explained Leyla Neri, director of the Master of Arts in Fashion Design, ""who for two years have undergone extensive training in style, technique, culture and innovation."" 
 
A special feature of the event will be the presentation of the students physical and digital accessories made in partnership with tech start-up,  Stage 11, offering them and the audience the opportunity to learn more about the metaverse. “Our meeting with Stage 11, a metaverse expert, convinced us,"" explained Xavier Romatet, IFM's general director. “We immediately proposed a collaboration with the company to our students, who all jumped at the opportunity and designed a digital piece to complete their collection of five physical pieces. Since the laws of physics no longer applied, the whole design process consisted of going beyond reality and pushing the limits of creativity.""

 The virtual creations include shoes of abstract shapes resembling works of art as done by Malgorzata Mazanek, a bag designed from nonexistent materials and capable of deforming at will according to Isabelle Derlon, Romain Rossi’s hairy shoes, Mathilde Rougier’s collection and Joshua Cannone’s lineup of bags and fantastical objects. 
 
The French-born New Yorker, trained in industrial design and selected to present his work at the next Festival d'Hyères, will showcase a collection of bags that think outside of the classic leather goods box in abstract, animal, and fetish-inspired shapes. The lineup includes a leather zipped man-shaped bag (the designer's favorite piece that is also offered virtually), a cocoon bag, a mini doll bag, and 3D printed rat-shaped water bottle holders. 
 
IFM plans on renewing this “new technological” dimension.

""The school must be one step ahead of the fashion design houses,"" added Romatet, ""and we must know how to integrate new technologies into all our teachings. We want to be a laboratory of multiple experiments and to work in the physical world as well as in the virtual world.""
 
The “virtualization in fashion” certificate, which launched at the school last September to accompany the “entrepreneurship in fashion” and “sustainability in fashion” certificates, offers 30 students lessons, meetings (recently done with Balenciaga), and the opportunity to create a virtual project. In March, IFM will initiate a collaboration with Reebok and Stage 11 that will allow students to design a virtual piece to add to the brand's main digital collection for its metaverse.

"Feb 18, 2022","Emerging and sustainable designers will get a chance to shine at London Fashion Week from Friday with major brands such as Burberry, Victoria Beckham and Vivienne Westwood either absent or sticking to digital formats for the five-day catwalk extravaganza.Burberry said without explanation it would hold a live show in March that is not part of the event, while ex-Spice girl Beckham -- who last held a live show in London two years ago -- has spoken of cost issues.

Following in the footsteps of designer brands such as Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana, meanwhile, Serbian designer Roksanda Ilincic will be selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering digital ownership of a 3D image of a dress from her label.The week kicks off with sustainable label SOHUMAN, created by Spaniard Javier Aparici who quit a career in finance to work in fashion and promises ""radical transparency"" on the factories used to make his garments.

As sustainability and upcycling become industry buzzwords, there will also be interest in Tuesday's shows by Britain's Bethany Williams and Ireland's Richard Malone.

Williams' materials include abandoned festival tents for garments and book waste for bags while Malone's creations feature fragments of materials including scrap leather.

- Beckham, Burberry -

The London event, which will showcase autumn/winter 2022 collections, was held entirely virtually a year ago as it coincided with a national lockdown. Live catwalk shows resumed last September.

This time there will be nearly 40 such shows including Simone Rocha, Molly Goddard, Roksanda, Erdem, Rejina Pyo and Ozwald Boateng whose last-minute surprise addition to the schedule will be his first at London fashion for 12 years.

Other designers are sticking to digital formats, such as punk icon Westwood, who will present her latest creations in a video.

Burberry confirmed to AFP it will hold a live catwalk show in London on March 11, outside of London Fashion Week. No further details were given on the decision.

It will be the brand's first live event in two years, after it participated in London's 2020 fashion week programme.

Beckham last held a live show for her luxury brand in London in February 2020, then put on online shows in September 2020 and February 2021.

The former Spice Girl told the Evening Standard in April 2021 that she would ""probably not"" be able to afford a live show in September that year due to the high costs. Her brand did not participate.

Emerging designers to look out for this week include Albanian-born Nensi Dojaka, who last year won the prestigious LVMH prize for young fashion designers, and Steven Stokey-Daley, creative director of Liverpool-based S.S. Daley.

There will also be a chance to spot future stars at Sunday shows put on by Central Saint Martins, a top fashion college, and Fashion East, a non-profit talent incubator.

In an innovation introduced during Britain's first national lockdown in June 2020, the catwalk shows will be available to view online on the organiser's website.'Very challenging years'After being hit hard by the pandemic, the British fashion sector, which employed about 890,000 people in 2019, is seeking a route to recovery.

Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council, which organises the fashion week, told AFP that the industry has had ""a very challenging couple of years"", exacerbated by Brexit-related changes that entered full force on January 31, 2020.

""Brexit continues to be a challenge for the fashion industry... whether it is tariffs or paperwork, visas for people to be able to work in different countries,"" Rush said.

The lifting of pandemic travel restrictions has allowed at least some international visitors to attend the fashion week.

""We won't have attendance from many Asian countries that still aren't able to travel,"" Rush said. ""But business can still be done.""

A 2021 report published by Oxford Economics for Creative England and the Creative Industries Federation found that with the right investment, the creative sector could recover from the pandemic faster than the UK economy as a whole.

It estimated growth of more than 26 percent in the four years to 2025, which would contribute around £132.1 billion ($180 billion, 153 billion euros) to the UK economy.

"Feb 17, 2022","Watch out, all you influencers! The TV series ""Euphoria"" could soon be stealing the show. A real phenomenon on social networks, the HBO drama has more and more followers around the world, to the point of imposing its trends on wardrobes and personal grooming. Nothing is spared, it seems, from makeup to nails through hair and outfits, turning the show into the standout fashion and beauty influencer of early 2022.This time, it's not a Netflix series that has been influencing people's clothing and cosmetic choices since the beginning of the year, but the hit show ""Euphoria,"" co-produced by Drake, the second season of which has been scoring success on HBO since early January. The craze is such that this second season is even managing to beat the first season's ratings, while also fueling some of the most heated debates on social networks.

Focusing on a young crowd with no taboos -- or almost -- ""Euphoria"" seems to appeal particularly to Gen Zers, who have set the show buzzing on their favorite social networks, from TikTok to Instagram through Snapchat. Much has been made of the themes addressed in the series, including romantic relationships. But since its release, the series also appears to be an incubator for fashion and beauty trends.So reveals Pinterest* in its latest report, which notes a growing interest in the makeup, hairstyles and even manicures spotted in the series. Nearly a week after it aired on HBO, the drama was responsible for a 41-fold increase in searches for ""Euphoria""-style party makeup. And, in this field, it is Cassie Howard, played by Sydney Sweeney, who seems to be the show's most influential character, with a 15-fold increase in searches for her makeup in particular.

Is Zendaya proving less influential than her co-stars? 

Pinterest is also seeing a craze for hairstyles from the hit series, which often sway between natural and ultra-sophisticated styles, with searches up sharply from early January. And this time, it's Jules Vaughn, a role played by Hunter Schafer, who's the focus of attention. Here, searches increased fourfold just after the launch of the second season.

When it comes to manicures, it is evidently Maddy Perez, played by Alexa Demie, who is influencing younger generations, with searches up sevenfold for her neat nails. Note that, for once, Zendaya is not the one setting the new beauty trends.

And the ""Euphoria"" phenomenon has not yet finished influencing fashion, beauty and more. On TikTok, the show's hashtag has nearly 25 billion views, while the hashtag dedicated to the show's makeup has nearly 1.5 billion views to date. And, speaking of fashion, the global search engine Stylight recently observed a growing craze for the Batsheva brand, highlighted by Lexi Howard in the episode featuring the gang's new year's celebrations.

*Pinterest's internal search data was analyzed on a global scale from December 16, 2021, to January 15, 2022, compared to the same period a year earlier.

"Feb 17, 2022","From balaclavas to facial coverings to hoodies that hide your entire head, wardrobes seem to be heading back into lockdown mode, whether it's about going incognito or wanting to spend a few more weeks in a sort of protective cocoon.Pictures of Kanye West stepping out fully masked-up have proved an inescapable sight from the latest Fashion Week in Paris. And we're not talking about a surgical mask, but a mask covering his entire face -- his accessory of choice for discovering the new collections of famous fashion houses like Balenciaga. This took things to a new level -- especially considering that he probably couldn't even see that well through the eye-holes, despite a privileged place on the front row. The fact remains that the famous rapper, who already gave the balaclava a popularity boost a few months ago, has clearly imposed a certain style, which is now gaining followers around the world.

It's hard to believe at a time when many people around the world are only too keen to ditch the face masks that have been part of their lives for almost two (long) years. You'd think that the desire to show yourself to the world again would be stronger than ever... However, the opposite seems to be happening. Maybe it's not so easy to give up on our protective screens. The sudden interest in accessories that conceal part or all of the face could be a sign of this underlying feeling.On TikTok, the #balaclava hashtag has accumulated no less than 180 million views, while Kanye West's looks at the recent Fashion Week went viral worldwide in just a few hours. Protecting the head and neck, the wool balaclava perfectly embodies this snug, cocoon-like spirit that continues to comfort people around the world, simultaneously acting as a kind of barrier against the virus. More broadly, the global fashion search engine Lyst recently reported a significant increase in searches for balaclavas, confirming the craze for these camouflage accessories.

The streetwear brand Supreme, which regularly offers balaclavas and similar such accessories, even went so far as to present a jacket that, once zipped up, covers your whole head. A means of going unnoticed while protecting yourself from the cold and the outside world.

This unexpected phenomenon, which is not expected to last, is also associated with a craze for clothing and accessories straight off the ski slopes, like Moon Boots, which have made a stylish incursion into the wardrobes of city dwellers this winter. In a different style, the full-face balaclava also fits perfectly with the pre-apocalyptic aesthetic, which is gaining a crowd of followers worldwide. But if all of this is beyond you... take a deep breath, winter is almost over!

"Feb 17, 2022","As the New York shows wound down and the circus gets ready to move out to the next stop London, three designers—Prabal Gurung, Bach Mai and Claudia Li—looked to their respective upbringing and the families and friends left behind in their different homelands and hometowns.Prabal GurungThe sexy and strategically placed crisscrossing straps connecting bustlines, waistlines, and hip lines; the pattern piece on clothes Prabal Gurung created as part of his Fall 2022 collection had an unexpected origin.

Backstage post-show, Gurung told reporters where the inspiration for the peek-a-boo styles with ties was drawn.“I haven’t been back home to Nepal for three or four years now because of the pandemic. I was looking at old albums of my grandmother and great grandmother, and they wore these sexy choli blouses but with a sari,” he explained, continuing, “I wanted to strip that away. The customer we dress is now coming with their daughters, and the collection has this understanding of them both.”

These continue to guide the designer. “This is a New York love song to Nepal from the women back home to women here who have been big supporters of mine. I always say my women are unapologetically glamorous and unabashedly feminine. This collection is a colorful and optimistic celebration.”For Gurung, colorful is an understatement; the brighter, the more acid, the more electric, the better. Whether shiny gowns in chartreuse, turquoise, or bright red to marabou feathers in a bright multi-color pattern dress or striped colorful upcycled furs. Those will be limited-edition due to source material availability which he is quick to say aren’t a sustainability statement but rather a small start. Rhododendron prints remind the designer’s homeland and appear on the more demure cuts, ostensibly for the moms.

But these are not wall flower looks by any means. These are for New York women who have no qualms about expressing personal style.

“New York women are resilient. I don’t want to say tough. That diminishes the whole thing. Its resilience: an attitude and unapologetic way of being themselves that says, ‘This is what I want to wear'.”Bach MaiWhat do Cy Twombly, Maison Margiela, Texas glamour, bijin-ga, and Hurel fabrics have to do with one another? These are just some of the many inspirations Bach Mai draws upon when creating his American couture-level made-to-order collection.

Speaking to press at The Stage at The Times Center, Mai was on hand, donned in a traditional couture atelier lab coat giving a personal tour of his sophomore effort entitled, 'A Flower Walk'. Twombly’s 2007 exhibit 'Blooming', featuring massive abstract expressionist flowers also featured a Haiku that caught Mai’s eye, which led the designer to the Japanese art form bijin-ga.“I discovered this disarming power of femininity in the connection between Twombly’s uniquely vibrant and refined color usage and the Japanese bijin-ga art drawings,” he recalled.

This combo manifested as an explosion of pastel ombrés resembling sunset or layered strips of chiffon in easter egg colors in one group or multiple shades of reds in another. The color was layered in different fabrics such as chiffon, velvet, or leather. The former became hand-torn strips sewn together for a layered stripe effect on long lean skirts worn with boning-exposed corsets and strapless bustier gowns.

“My collection has been a lifelong goal. I fell in love with haute couture when I was really young because of John Galliano,” explained the Houston, Texas native.

The 33-year-old designer attended Parson in both New York and Paris, working for designers Oscar de la Renta and Prabal Gurung before landing a dream job working for John Galliano at Maison Margiela as the first assistant. Thus, comes the Texas glamour.

“The goal was always to go to Paris and learn couture, the craftsmanship, then come back and be an American designer because we have haute couture clients here,” he continued, noting he started making dresses for women and their daughters as a teen in Texas.

""Women in Texas have a real understanding of glamour which leads to the fearlessness of these clothes,” Mai said, adding, “Glamorous clothing gets a bad rap, but they want the clothes now as there are so many weddings. Some shop for the dress and make anything an occasion; they will find somewhere to wear it.”

Mai is keenly aware of his capabilities as a young designer starting out. Couture-level fabrics are generally out of reach for a fledgling brand like Mai’s. He is fortunate, though, to have an unsung industry hero as a partner, Hurel, the French heritage fabric house founded in 1879. He explained it was a partnership that helped many of the greats.

“Saint Laurent and Dior both started with fabric partners such as Abraham and Boussac, respectively. Dior’s New Look fabric use post-war was an extravagance, but he could do it because of the partnership between him and the textiles company. It’s a beautiful story between fabric houses and designers,” Mai said.

French training, French fabrics but couture needs French artisans as well. Finding that type of craftsmanship here can be challenging, he admitted.

“We have craftsmanship here. It hasn’t been exalted or focused on, though. I love bringing these garments to the sewers because I see the expressions on their faces, and they are so excited to work on things like this. It’s not the same thing,” he continued. Mai’s work certainly is not.Claudia LiThe pandemic and its casual dress codes may be winding down, but Claudia Li wants to explore just how to keep that cozy vibe going.

“I went back to New Zealand for two years and during the whole lockdown I was wearing pajamas and sweats every day. The selection gets repetitive so now was the time to think about the next step, ‘how do I style them to wear outside,’” she noted.The collection imagined these clothes from a romantic and personal viewpoint. Her opening group of quilted pink floral oversized garments big enough to cover an actual bed in many cases —a massive poncho for instance­—came from childhood memories.

“It came from the bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me as a baby. I don’t remember much but they were ancient Chinese fairy tales.”

The large proportions also appeared at the show’s end in a sheer red and white sheer organza segment, the scarlet color evoking Chinese ceremonial robes. Many looks throughout employed a hip treatment of smaller gathered fabric bustles that gave an 18th century silhouette to the clothes but allowed for modern movement.

While these groups were bolder and fantasy dressing, in between Li showed a black and green group for smart dressing with a sculptural slant. She adorned several looks with macramé ‘vests’ that were finished in fringe that swept the floor. The technique also showed up as water bottle holders for instance. A certain amount of craft is a staple of Li’s collection; the kind that looks like it has to be shipped offshore to make. But it’s not the case at all.

“We do the macramé and beading craftsmanship in house. I have a really amazing team and interns; we all learn to do it together,” she explained.

The report highlights three trending fashion categories starting with 'Rooted in Nature', the result of a new found connection between consumer and the natural world during the pandemic, calling attention to sweaters, hiking boots, deep browns, and forest greens.Likewise, 'Collegiate Classic', which includes varsity sweatshirts, a-line skirts and knitted vests, comes as more than four million Americans changed career or left their jobs in 2021, while 'Digital Wonder' explores the intersection of future and fantasy with bold colors, opulent materials, and fluid, silky surfaces to luxurious metallics and extravagant embellishments.

“Consumer lifestyles and closets have undergone a major shift since the start of the pandemic,” said Danny Kim, senior consultant at WGSN.

“From knitted vests to hiking boots and bomber jackets, this report pulls from a blend of global expert insights, unique data, and cross-industry knowledge. We’ve uncovered what’s top of mind for fashion-forward consumers in 2022.”

As part of the partnership, Faire and WGSN will host a free virtual webinar on Thursday where Kim will dive into what colors, materials, patterns, and styles are trending.

“Independent brands and local retailers rely on Faire’s data about the apparel industry to make strategic business decisions each buying season,” added Anjarae Hamilton, head of apparel at Faire. “Working side by side with the WGSN team to uncover emerging trends will play an important role in helping both brands and buyers with inventory planning and merchandising calendars for the rest of the year.”

In November, Faire secured $400 million in a Series G investment round, bringing the company’s total valuation up to $12.4 billion. The round is Faire’s third in just over a year. 

Faire was founded in 2017 and serves 300,000 retailers across North America and Europe, as well as 40,000 brands from over 80 countries.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2022","After six years of retiring from fashion, Ennio Capasa makes a comeback. The Italian designer sold Costume National, the brand he founded in 1986 with his brother Carlo, to his Japanese financial partner, the Sequedge investment group in 2016. After devoting himself to drawing and sculpting these recent years, he returns to the forefront with a new project. A spokesperson has indicated to us that his new brand, Capasa Milano, will launch during Milan Fashion Week. The ready-to-wear and accessories brand for women and men will mainly retail online through mini limited-edition collections, such as the one launching on Tuesday, February 22. Capasa will unveil a first collection dubbed ""Before it starts"" at the Arcimboldi Theatre that evening, which will be available for purchase in September.

The Apulia-born designer’s purpose is to offer timeless, sustainable, high-end fashion emphasizing a “made in Italy” production while also focusing on couture and technology. The ready-to-wear pieces will be outsourced; The hosiery company Modit International will manufacture the knitwear while Him (High Italian Manufacturing) and formerly known as the Onward Luxury Group, will be in charge of the shoes. The project, which is currently self-financed, will reunite the Capasa siblings. Ennio will be accompanied by his brother Carlo who will hold a strategic supporting role in the company but who will no longer be involved in the operational management department like he was in the past. Their New York-based sister Rita will also participate and be a part of the marketing and distribution team.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 16, 2022","The LVMH Prize, the competition for emerging fashion designers launched in 2014, received 1,900 entries from around the world. For its ninth edition, it selected 20 semi-finalist brands from 13 countries and welcomed a designer from Sri Lanka for the very first time, Amesh Wijesekera (head of the unisex brand Amesh).Europe came out on top, providing the competition with ten emerging fashion brands. The two French brands, Bluemarble by Anthony Alvarez and Weinsanto by Victor Brunstein Weinsanto, are followed by the two Spanish fashion houses, Paula Canova del Vas and Palomo Spain by Alejandro Gòmez Palomo, who was selected for the second time by the prestigious competition and was a semi-finalist in its 2017 edition. Also selected were the British labels Maximilian by Maximilian Davis and S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey Daley, KNWLS by English designer Charlotte Knowle and Canadian Alexandre Arsenault, Irish designer Róisín Pierce, Meryll Rogge who originates from Belgium and the Italian creator Niccolò Pasqualetti.

Asia also provided a major share of candidates despite many of the selected names already having made a name for themselves in the United Kingdom or the United States, where they studied or are based in. Alongside Sri Lankan Amesh label by Amesh Wijesekera, the list of semi-finalists includes two Chinese brands, Chenpeng by Peng Chen, a leader of the new “made in China” generation and the designer Yueqi Qi (who was spotted by Gucci and invited to its GucciFest) the New York-based, South Korean designer Ashlynn Park with her label Ashlyn and her compatriot Goom Heo at the head of Goomheo. The Japanese designer Ryunosuke Okazaki and his brand RyunosukeOkazaki were also selected. Three of the brands hail from the United States: Airei by Drew Curry, Erl by Eli Russell Linnetz and Winnie New York by Idris Balogun, while Africa is represented by Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James, who will showcase in Milan next week. The selection ""expresses a great diversity of cultures and talents"", offering women, men, and unisex collections.

""The twenty semi-finalists are driven by an optimistic and innovative vision. They all place eco-responsibility at the heart of their creative approach with the use of recycled materials, upcycling, etc. They are also very committed to integrating a more ethical production system, while some honor local and traditional know-how. The fluidity of womenswear and menswear is another key feature of this edition,” underlined Delphine Arnault, supervisor of the luxury group’s fashion contest. 

Like last year, the public will be able to vote on the lvmhprize.com website in the semi-final phase for the candidate of their choice, while a committee of nearly 70 recognized experts from the fashion industry which includes Camille Charrière, Eva Chen, Ben Cobb, Pierre A. M'Pelé, Mel Ottenberg, Julia Sarr-Jamois, Cindy Sherman and Eugénie Trochu, will have the delicate responsibility of selecting the finalists, who will present their designs in Paris from March 4 to 5.

Only eight competitors will be selected for the final. Their names will be revealed in March during the upcoming Paris Fashion Week while the LVMH 2022 Prize will be awarded this summer. The winner will receive a €300,000 endowment and the winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize will be rewarded €150,000. In both cases, the victors will benefit from a year-long mentorship by the luxury group's teams. As usual, LVMH will also reward three young graduates fresh out of fashion school.

"Feb 16, 2022","PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger, in partnership with Harlem’s Fashion Row, has announced the three finalists selected for its New Legacy Challenge, a design competition which aims to promote the next generation of Black designers. First launched in 2021, as part of Hilfiger’s People’s Place Program, designers were invited to apply for the challenge by sharing their take on modern preppy - a style that has always been central to the Tommy Hilfiger DNA. 

After a virtual design preview of the top 12 applicants, three finalists were chosen to advance to the final round. The finalists of the competition are Megan Smith, the founder of sustainable women’s brand Megan Renee; Johnathan Hayden, head of his namesake luxury brand; and Clarence Ruth, founder of denim label Cotte D’Armes.Next, each finalist, with guidance from a Tommy Hilfiger brand mentor, will reimagine six iconic preppy styles, including the hoodie, varsity jacket and polo shirt to be presented to a panel of judging members in March. 

The winner of the New Legacy Challenge will receive a grant of US$20,000 and the opportunity to co-design a capsule collection alongside the Tommy Hilfiger design team. The winner will be announced at an event, which will also premiere the documentary series New Legacy Challenge, directed by award-winning filmmaker Luchina Fisher, highlighting how each designer was inspired to take on the challenge.

Ahead of the final event in March, designers took the stage at Harlem's Fashion Row's 4th Annual Black History Month Summit on Tuesday to share their experience and journey with the New Legacy Challenge. 

“Tommy Hilfiger’s People’s Place Program offers a dynamic opportunity for talented designers of color, who have long been side-lined in the fashion industry,” said Brandice Daniel, CEO & founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row. 

“We are proud partners of this program because it promotes true foundational change. The partnership is also our way of amplifying the voices of the next generation of Black designers.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 15, 2022","Two years after losing her job in fashion due to the pandemic, Emma Gage founded her own brand, Melke, that debuted at this season's New York Fashion Week with an emphasis on sustainability.The 26-year-old from Minnesota is not the first to bet on this trend, at a moment when the fashion industry has faced criticism for its environmental impact.

Another designer, 23-year-old Olivia Cheng, told AFP that ""everybody now wants to be part of this conversation.""Her brand, Dauphinette -- known for its jewelry and outfits crafted from real flowers -- was featured on New York fashion week's official calendar for the first time, showing over the weekend at a Chinatown restaurant.

Gage cited the use of hemp, organic cotton and recycled fabrics as materials that are less environmentally harmful, and also voiced her mission to purchase materials from companies committed to respecting human rights.

""I would never want to come out and say like, yeah, everything's 100%, sustainable, everything's perfect,"" Gage said. ""Because that's a lie.""

Speaking from her studio in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood, a trendy area for New York creatives, Gage said she's ""focusing on making pieces that will last.""

- Zero plastic? Still elusive -

She said ""zero plastic"" remains an elusive goal at the moment, because synthetic materials often slip into recycled fabrics.

Thus the focus on durability, and making use of every piece of fabric on hand: Gage creates ""scrap bags"" made out of small bits of material, for example.

Far from voluminous or elegant evening gowns, one of Gage's favorite items is the humble sweater, which she makes a play on every collection with embroidered motifs -- flowers, fish and now sheep have graced her pieces.

But keeping it simple doesn't translate to less creativity. The designer's second collection -- inspired by the Anne Carson book ""Autobiography of Red"" -- emphasizes this strong color, often incorporating dark tones and using fringe reminiscent of lava flows.

For her fall/winter 2022 collection, set for presentation Tuesday, Gage wanted to evoke memories of a trip to an Irish medieval castle and her discovery of falconry: ""The symbiotic relationship of two predators working together -- you have human and a bird trying to work together for the same common goal.""Gingko nuts and beetle wingsCheng's presentation Sunday bet on old clothes and floral materials, preserved thanks to a resin she said is non-toxic.

She also ventured into experimentation, offering one outfit made of gingko nuts and a dress studded with beetle wings -- which she specified died of natural causes and not for her project.

Both designers said they favor local suppliers but aren't against sourcing from elsewhere.

Gage said that only sourcing stateside ""completely eliminates all of the beautiful craftsmanship that exists around the world.""

She does face a dilemma of keeping her brand -- which makes pieces to order -- affordable.

""I can't be the only one making things more affordable, if they're sustainable,"" she said. ""I need other people to also be buying what I'm buying so that the price can go down.""

But that kind of popularity could create its own problem of overproduction and waste. Gage has tried to approach the problem by creating a product line with varying price points, the least expensive being a t-shirt for $75.

Cheng -- the daughter of Chinese immigrants who has two dresses on show in the Metropolitan Museum's current fashion exhibition -- is able to keep prices lower for her fruit and flower jewelry, with some pieces going for less than $50.

""It's most central to me to remember why we started our mission and how we can kind of further that story,"" she said. ""And to not get caught up in kind of the illusions of grandeur.""

"Feb 15, 2022","After veering into the 2000s for several months, fashion is (already) reviving the previous decade, by far its favorite and most influential. From grunge to sportswear to baby doll, the aesthetics that arose, or were at their peak, during the 1990s are many and varied. But it is another trend straight from this decade that is currently enjoying a moment in the fashion spotlight: the total jeans look, as updated by Kanye West and Julia Fox.It's been a while... sort of. In a seemingly eternal cycle, fashion can't help but return to its two favorite decades, the '70s and the '90s, as inexhaustible sources of fashion trends. While Generation Z has recently taken a shine to the 2000's -- or Y2K -- the 1990's are back on top with a major, nay timeless trend of the decade: the total jeans look. This unique style was sported by Kanye West and Julia Fox during the last Paris Fashion Week, nodding to the double denim power couple of the late 1990s, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.

The month of February could well be a month for denim, and that's head-to-toe denim if you please! No matter if the temperatures don't make you want to swap your puffer for a denim jacket, the craze for the famous fabric seems unwavering. According to global fashion search engine Stylight*, Google search interest for the keywords ""total jeans"" increased by 91% between the last week of January and the first week of February. And all denim pieces seem to be in favor.The international platform notes an increase in searches for denim jumpsuits (+81%), also confirming that workwear style is well established as a trend for early 2022. But denim shirts are also popular (+33%), as well as classic jeans (+29%), and of course the inevitable denim jacket (+18%).

The trend is gaining ground on TikTok too, with a host of videos -- and views -- based on the total denim look, often even including caps and shoes -- yes, yes, you read that right. And influencers are in on the act too, like Chiara Ferragni, who seems to have taken to this style hailing straight from fashion's trendiest decade.

*This Stylight data is based on analysis of the shopping behavior of the platform's 160 million annual shoppers and clicks on the categories mentioned for the period of January 25-31, 2022 versus February 1-7, 2022. Google search interest was analyzed on Google Trends for the period January 1, 2022 to February 7, 2022.

"Feb 15, 2022","As fashion events return in physical form, they continue to be influenced by the digital and the virtual, and that means NFTs and the metaverse are making a big impact.To coincide with London fashion Week that starts on Friday, Roksanda has linked with LFW sponsor and BNPL giant Clearpay “to bring digitisation, accessibility and innovation to fashion lovers everywhere”.

They’ve created an exclusive demi couture finale look from Roksanda’s forthcoming show in the form of an NFT. The idea originated from Clearpay, which worked collaboratively with Roksanda and the Institute of Digital Fashion to bring the project to life. It’s a first for for both the firm and the luxury label in the metaverse. The physical demi couture finale look will debut on the runway during Roksanda’s LFW showcase next Monday, with the digital version “giving consumers tangible access to high-end fashion that they previously wouldn’t have been able to”. 

There’s also an AR function allowing consumers to virtually 'try on' the NFT.

That NFT is available in three limited edition products, with Product 1 at £25 being a 3D garment render, and static 2D collectible. Product 2 at £250 is a 3D garment animation render and 3D object showcase. And the luxury £5,000 Product 3 is a 3D garment animation render plus 3D object showcase and Clo3d working file 10 (the software used to create the digital version of the dress).

Clearpay CEO Nick Molnar said: “We’re proud to be able to help democratise fashion, and enable consumers to buy, interact, and engage with Roksanda’s artistry in such an innovative way. It’s exciting to see this all come to life at such an important moment in the British fashion calendar.”

Meanwhile, also happening this week, is Metaverse Fashion Week, an event produced by Everyrealm and Blueberry Entertainment. 

On Monday, it featured Jonathan Simkhai as the debut designer, a day before the physical Jonathan Simkhai 2022 presentation at NYFW. The label was “the first ever to show its Fall/Winter 2022 digital wearables collection ahead of their physical counterparts”. Some 11 pieces were shown.The designs were transformed into digital wearables by Blueberry Entertainment, a digital wearables production studio that “grew out of increasing demand for digital clothing”. Everyrealm, a “metaverse real estate investor and developer”, coordinated the production and is hosting an NFT sale of select wearables from the collection after the event beginning this Wednesday.

Models, influencers, celebrities, and journalists from the fashion, tech, and lifestyle industries were among the VIP guests, who appeared via personalised avatars dressed in Jonathan Simkhai.

To add to the appeal of the event, the last look (a gold gown) lost its components as the avatar moved down the runway, something only really possible in the metaverse.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 15, 2022","However deep the freeze came over New York Monday morning, great fashion warmed plenty of hearts on this chilly day at fashion week. Three designers showed plenty to love about their collections and spirits.Coach""Long ago, and, oh, so far away,"" began the lyrics of The Carpenters 1971 hit song 'Superstar', sung by the late Karen Carpenter with her angelic voice. It was one of two songs by the saccharine and wholesome seventies brother-sister pop music duo that helped cement the scene Stuart Vevers of Coach created for the Fall 2022 show.The set and show notes evoked a friendly small-town American place. The set, inside Basketball City, featured home facades, an old station wagon, kids riding bikes, and an Afghan dog being walked all at dusk, where golden hour seemed to linger forever. A fixation on this sort of Americana has been the executive creative director's MO since taking the reins in 2013.

Fast forward almost ten years, and distilling that design impetus is aimed squarely at Gen Z. Sure, mom and dad may love the great accessories and even the outerwear. These days Vever's pursuit of today's youth and their various tribes has helped put Coach's parent company Tapestry Inc. on track to top 2021 level of $5.746 billion in revenue.In Coachville, USA, no one seems to be bogged down in such matters. Instead, they enjoy simple pursuits and simply turn staple clothing pieces into fashion statements. The biggest news lately for Coach is the oversized proportions and then some, just like the kids like them. Shearling jackets, baggy surf shorts, and enormous t-shirts for those who prefer a male aesthetic and late 1960s and early 1970s dress styles modeled after little girl dresses—think Mia Farrow in 'Rosemary's Baby'—for a feminine side. They came short and flirty in chiffon floral prints with Peter Pan collars and lace yolk details; one group was endearing white pointelle crochet dresses.

""My collections often begin with a feeling, and for Fall, the feeling was love,"" said Vevers in a prepared statement. ""To express this, the collection explores tensions between romance and toughness to reinvestigate Coach heritage. I liked the idea of creating a nostalgic world somewhere in America seen through a widescreen lens, mixing the energy of today with the nostalgia for pop culture that has always inspired me.""

The tension was easy to spot. Immediately following the sweet quartet out came what could best be described as a biker or leather daddy; Vevers alluded to that in the 'The Coach Neighborhood Newsletter' handed out to guests and post-show notes. Even quaint American towns have a mysterious underside. Here, however, Vevers was introducing a line-up of archival leather styles—including a 1964 sling bag— for the next-gen to discover. After all, it is a leather goods house. The finale styles featured leather, given a graffiti print courtesy of Mint+Serf.

It was all very nostalgic and heartwarming, apropos for Valentine's Day. The Coach family of entertainers, personalities, and influencers was there in force; Megan Thee Stallion, Hari Nef, Tommy Dorfman, Quincy Brown, Rina Sawayama, Bob the Drag Queen, Rickey Thompson, and more. They were just the kind of folks Vevers hoped would live in Coachville.Carolina Herrera Wes Gordon's Valentine's Day morning show for Carolina Herrera was a fiesta of amor with plenty to love. Gordon's added a bit more Latin flair to his collection of elegant and sophisticated cocktail and evening dresses, but it was all in the name of dramatic fashion.Borrowing from French composer Georges Bizet's 'Carmen', Gordon used a guitar rendition of ""L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"" (also known as 'The Habanera') as part of his runway musical selection.

""There is a drama and a boldness and a beauty that I always try to capture in the collection that is in sync with Latin culture,"" he said post-show in an interview. ""Our woman is bold and self-assured and loves dramatic clothing. But no matter her nationality, she dresses to impress. I think the moment for all of those,"" he continued adding, ""I saw this 110 percent in our business. People are excited to wear clothes. It's no longer about 'I have a special occasion', so you buy a dress. Instead, you buy the special pieces, and they turn any moment into an occasion.""

These clothes were the occasion indeed. Smart cocktail numbers hinted at Hollywood's Golden Age—think a close-knit button cardigan and skinny cigarette pants worn under a full taffeta skirt and train. Tension was created between the lean silhouettes, which recalled matador costumes and volume, such as mutton gypsy sleeves on blouses played throughout the show. Beading and paillettes brought a dose of sing to the line-up.

Colored added to the excitement. A tiered skirt looked like an expressive painting with a yellow waistband, black overlay, and pink underlay—ditto on a dress in black, yves klein, and light blue. An exquisite red, pink and purple tulle strapless dress captivated and drew attention to the other statement, form.

You could say shape took home the top prize. In various iterations, a series of dresses made from poof tulle balls closed the show. These may be Gordon's most prized designs.

""I'm obsessive-compulsive when it comes to creating the clothes. Most of the pieces you saw were created 4 or 5 times in muslins before being cut in the real fabric,"" he explained. This type of craftsmanship rivals European houses.

""I'm so lucky to work at Herrera, which has a full atelier right here in New York City,"" he added.

Coincidentally Monday's show gave him a chance to thank that atelier. After Gordon took his bow, he brought out two older gentlemen in white design room smock coats. This would be the tailor's last show before retiring after 19 and 22 years in the Carolina Herrera design room. It was also poignant that the show took place in an empty retail space (lots of those in New York these days) in the Flatiron district where the New York garment industry was born.

""They are irreplaceable, but fortunately, we have some more talented sewers and tailors joining the team,"" Gordon assured. Earlier, he noted the importance of appreciating every moment, which, in this show, all most certainly did.ÀchevalSofia Àchaval de Montaigu and Lucila Sperber, co-founders of Àcheval, sent NYFW an Argentinian Valentine’s Day surprise for their Fall 2022 collection presentation.The pair hosted a dinner at Socialista, the Casa Cipriani private event space with a South American vibe. It was the perfect spot to showcase the upcoming season’s collection inspired by the northern Argentinian countryside, writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges, and Gen Z. The former account for the colorful knitwear and sailors-inspired looks. Velvet was vital to this tightly edited group as tailored pieces and dresses take cues from the gaucho lifestyle and tango culture.

The playfulness was attributed to Gen Z but where they will experience the clothes. “We have a new partner Arthur Madrid of Sandbox. The collection will twin between the metaverse and the real world.”

The first drop will appear in both worlds in June with a plan to launch a new product every two months. “Gen Z will discover on the metaverse and then will buy in real life, for instance. They are sometimes one person in the metaverse and another in real life,” noted Lucila. “We wanted to capture the e-commerce vibe, and we see that we can match reality with cyberspace.”

A special treat for guests was an interpretative horse dance by a modern dancer wearing an Àcheval poncho. She warmed guests up for Sebastián Faena, a friend and photographer who shot their Fall 2022 campaign and sings. Wearing a signature Àcheval corset, Faena wooed guests jumping up on a banquet belting out a sultry tune.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 14, 2022","As shows plowed through the weekend, most in attendance weren’t concerned with the other big event aka Superbowl LVI happening, which was later than normal this year, thus coinciding with New York Fashion Week. Jocks weren't the inspiration anyhow.

Brandon Maxwell, Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk of Area, Sergio Hudson and Joseph Altuzarra all paid tribute to the female muses that inspired them in one way or another. The weather may have returned to a more seasonal wintry mix but NYFW was just beginning to heat up.Brandon MaxwellAs guests entered the Brandon Maxwell show Saturday and shuffled to their seats, they navigated a blackened room brought to life by the occasional spotlight. Anyone caught under such a beam was literally on the spot, cause for reflection. This played well as the show opened up with a film, narrating Brandon Maxwell’s life as per his Wikipedia entry and showing flashbacks to his childhood and family life. A recorded conversation between the designer and his grandmother, Mammaw, drove home the sentimental expression.The show opened to a melancholic rendition of John Denver’s 'Take Me Home Country Roads', a song that connected the clothes to the designer's past. The clothes exuded a certain comfy quilted feeling driven home by massive cozy scarves.

Post-show, Maxwell came out of the massive black curtain wall to greet well-wishers and journalists, perhaps so models could change in peace and explained the huge knit shawls.“I learned when I was a kid to make skirts and ball gowns out of blankets at my grandmother’s house,” the designer explained. “I would tie them around my sisters, and that is how I started playing with silhouettes and teaching myself as a child.”

He may have been referencing his childhood, but he looked at photos of his grandmother and her friends’ younger days in the 1950s to draw inspiration for the ball skirts that dominated the collection. They came pleated, tiered in tulle, or realized an oversized chunky knit ball skirt fused to a sheer bustier. Mother-of-the-bride jackets and a fitted bodice topped with a dramatic sculpted bodice were given a hip spin paired with shredded denim jeans. A comfy vibe was evidenced throughout within the context of polished glamour.

The Texan native decided to forgo a traditional final walk, instead lining the models up against the back wall bringing his design team out to make sure they shared in the glory of the audience's applause. Maxwell’s family was in attendance, and his father took the bow with him, adding to the moving show.

“The world, at least my world, led up to this being a more emotional show,” he said. The circumstance yielded a powerful and touching effort.AreaLast September, Simone Biles wore an elaborate 88-pound beaded crystal convertible dress and coordinating catsuit from Athleta to the Met Gala, designed by Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk. of Area. It seemed a death-defying challenge for the diminutive Olympian to pull off, but she did. The avant-garde independent brand, known for its use of crystals, in a similar way is pulling off some feats of its own as the brand grows up and into itself, with a new multi-purpose space on lower Bowery that houses the atelier above it.According to Panszczyk, it can be used as a showroom, retail space, and even a small runway show owing to its long narrow shape. It takes cues from Andy Warhol’s factory—silver-colored walls and coordinated custom couch spelling out Area—but adds a series of screens adapted to today’s lifestyle.

It was the perfect setting to host one-on-one appointments to view the collection released digitally on Sunday. Panszczyk explained seeing the combination of RTW and couture clothes up close was necessary to appreciate them fully.

“It was important to open this showroom and not just do a runway show because I want people to look at them and experience them to appreciate the craftsmanship we work hard to achieve,” the co-designer said of the pieces.  

Beyoncé and Dua Lipa are fans of Area. Those entertainers will find more to love in this group, which showgirls across the globe and time-inspired; think Josephine Baker to Las Vegas showgirls to Rio de Janeiro Carnival gals and the 1920s.

The duo explored a showgirl’s favorite tool, the feather, which was created in metal.

“Doing feathers was obvious, but how to make them gilded,” the designer suggested. Working with a German female sculptor in Rome, they fashioned the bras, corset, facepieces, and harnesses out of brass feathers that were also articulated and not static.

Preciosa crystals were abundant on everything, from a bustier to a headpiece that created crystal hair strands. They especially stood out on a double butterfly top which loosely referenced Paul Poiret that Panszczyk said was “a couture piece perfected over time until they are market-ready to sell.”

It was hard to name one piece de resistance, but it may have been the black embroidered cape dress with molded shoulders which involved 18 different embroidery specialists and over 4,150 work hours to complete. “I’m just a small part of this process. It’s all together with these amazing artisans, all of these hands. In the end, it’s created by handwork,” he conceded.

The molded effect is created using paniers, aka baskets on several gowns, including the embroidered stunner, and Biles' number harkened back to Thierry Mugler. Panszczyk wasn’t afraid to acknowledge that. “The majority of my work is an ode to Mugler. He was all of it together; an amazing showman and exquisite couturier who made women go nuts for his clothes. They even altered their bodies to look like a Mugler girl,” he said.

Creating the strategic humps drew upon a traditional way of making the baskets from boning then covering for a smooth finish with French wool. “It was a skill set we didn’t even know we had,” he explained.

Maybe, but between the two of them, there is plenty of skill to go around.Sergio HudsonMinutes before Sergio Hudson’s models took the runway, the South Carolina native designer was backstage rolling styling directives off his tongue, coolly and calmly. “We don’t need that,” he said to a dresser regarding a belt on a coat. “Where is her hat,” he queried to another.This precision sharp vision of his collection exemplifies the brand itself, which delivers styles made for today with the right touch of yesterday in a rainbow of colors. It’s also garnered legions of fans for the designer who has starred on the 2014 Bravo reality show 'Styled to Rock' and dressed former First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris on inauguration day.

His Spring 2022 outing had something for powerful female politicians and trend-conscious style-setters alike. He started with a color palette inspired by the Ndebele tribe in Africa and a print he developed.

“Normally, I’m a one-print per collection type designer. I was looking to reupholster something and found this piece of leather,” he explained, adding, “I don’t know what kind of animal it was, but I reconfigured it and made a new print.”

He found the pastel colors of the South African tribe fun. “It made me think about 'Clueless' or 'A Different World' and what these great fashion girls would wear on safari? It’s a fun and cheeky collection,” he said.

That could also describe the show that was jam-packed with his fans who reacted with cheers and encouragement when seeing veteran models like Beverly Johnson and Veronica Webb or another model who slipped get back up.

The silhouettes were totally nineties and just suitable for today. The prints looked especially good as knits such as a pencil skirt and cropped cardigan. Sleeveless tailoring on dresses, cropped leather denim-style jackets with matching shorts, flirty chiffon dresses, asymmetrical satin trenches, bias-cut camisole gowns with trains, and off-the-shoulder white shirt dressing (a nod to Byron Lars?) all felt fresh. The shoes also channeled those fictitious LA fashion characters of the nineties and early aughts. This season Hudson collaborated with Malone Souliers on two styles, the Lilli and the Jojo, in an array of pastel and neutral colors to complete the look.

In keeping with the decade's mood, he used a raised runway and sent girls in groups à la Armani. The safari outfits, scoop neck thin knit dresses, and wide brim hat numbers were entertaining to watch. The music was equally fun and upbeat, adding to the incredible energy this show brought forth.Altuzarra“For me, it was this triumph of imagination in a time when we haven’t been able to travel or escape as much. I’ve escaped in books and stories, and this was an homage to that,” Joseph Altuzarra said backstage following his Fall/Winter 2022 runway show, which took place at the historic and ornate Woolworth Building, which also houses his lower Manhattan headquarters.It was a triumph in reality too. The theme was heavily hinted upon as guests arriving found copies of Moby Dick at their seats that had been earmarked with bits from a mood board.

“It was a journey. I was interested in this idea of a sailor and a traveler, and they sort of slowly become this mermaid,” he continued to explain backstage, adding, “It was a simple story. We built the collection around it.”

What wasn’t simple was the clothes. They were rich and complex in all the right ways. It was heavy on volume, proportion mixing, layering, textures, intricate techniques, and embellishments, another result of exploration. Several looks riffed on fisherman sweaters, mariners and pea coats, and sailor suits but went far beyond just one linear theme. Richly dyed Batik printing and floral prints added a gypsy vibe; together, it read chic seafaring vagabond.

“Every season, we explore more and more craft, especially global craft by working with artisans from different parts of the world. Weirdly I think it’s become even more important because we haven’t been able to travel,” he offered, adding, “At the root of what I do is this sense of my identity which comes from different places. I like crafting identities from different languages. It was a romantic and personal collection.”

The lineup of great skirts and dresses often came with silver trimmed belts and straps that may have alluded to treasures found in a shipwreck along the journey, for example. Knitwear was purposely tattered and patterned to match a dyed skirt. Leathers were pleated into large circle skirts, appearing almost monastic on a black dress and chocolate brown capelet and skirt combo.

Guests were awed by the series finale that included two dresses made from hand-dyed metal paillettes that made a variegated fish scale effect and made a fantastic swooshing sound as it passed. “In the collection, I wanted to sort of give into a sense of play and exploration,"" he said of the swishing dresses. “The sound of the dresses evoked the ocean. We played with different swatches, moving them around to find the right sound of the ocean.”

Other drama played out in fur-trimmed hoods often pushed down around the neck or tightly knit caps. High platforms and flatform sandals balanced the proportion, as did various backpack satchels or shoulder bags worn in double.

The magpie styling and theme might have naysayers, or those with a narrow POV may draw a line to John Galliano’s 'A Folk Horror Tale' collection and film. But the themes Altuzarra explored are universal, and the resulting collection distinctly and uniquely his.

"Feb 14, 2022","There are few more overhyped words used in fashion today than sustainability, though one brand that sincerely walks the ecological talk is Ecoalf. The Madrid-based marque has been recycling since its inception a decade ago: first with Korean trawlers gathering waste plastic in the sea, and today with over a 3,500 fishermen in the Mediterranean who weekly gather detritus off the sea floor.
 
Its slogan, 'There Is No Planet B', has been copied frequently, yet it forms the basis of Ecoalf’s particular and unique ethos. Notably, one key element in Ecoalf is that the brand regularly forgoes getting a heftier bottom-line in order to respect its ecological credo.Last month, Ecoalf took over a prime location in Pitti – the world’s best organized fashion fair, based in Florence – this week we caught up with brand founder Javier Goyeneche. He got the name for the brand from his two sons, Alfredo and Alvaro, when he had the initial idea of creating a totally sustainable fashion brand. 
“I thought the most sustainable thing was not to keep on using natural resources. So, recycling was the solution. But while making the same quality and design as brands that were not recycling,” explains Goyeneche, inside Ecoalf’s airy new Marais 150-square-meter boutique, whose pale gray walls and floors are made of a blend of recycled cotton and cement.
 
Back in 2009 there were no cool recycled materials readily available, so Goyeneche and his team began developing their own. His holy grail began with a retired lady in Taiwan, recycling plastic bottles into carpets, then moved to Korea, where he began creating fabrics made from discarded nylon fishing nets.
 
By 2013, he finally launched the brand with just six jackets and two backpacks. Today Ecoalf retails in over 2,000 sales points internationally.
 
“Since our first collection, we have gone on to develop over 500 different fabrics,” explained Goyeneche, whose knowledge of textiles and new materials oft makes him sound more of a scientist than fashion executive.
 
Surprisingly, many of the fabrics have a very agreeable “hand,” like the recycled cotton T-shirts that are soft and a tiny but spongy. Ecoalf have also managed to prevent recycled polyester looking too shiny and made it look practically mat. Seen in some natty puffer gilets and coats inside the Paris stores. 
Their recycled cashmere is post-industrial, generally scrap, and most of their wool comes from Prato, the nerve center of Italian garment recycling outside Florence. Inside the store, there’s even an Ocean Room, an installation with videos and testimonies of their Mediterranean project.
 
“Our biggest program is upcycling from the ocean. With our program we started with a few fishermen. Now we have over 3,500 fishermen we work with; and over 1,000 tons of waste recovered from the bottom of the ocean,” explained Goyeneche.
 
One key sponsor is Kingspan, which takes the leftovers of the waste to be used in insulation panels. The Ireland-based Kingspan predicts it will upcycle one billion bottles into insulation by 2025.  
 
Movie-star handsome, Goyeneche is forthright, and outspoken. When one suggests that when sustainability is often just PR spin, and brand washing by luxury marques, he responds directly.
 
“Yes, it probably is. Nobody is 100% sustainable that is the first thing to realize. Many people in fashion say, ‘we plan to use 100% sustainable fabrics.’ But I say the problem with you guys is that your business models in not sustainable. It’s not just fabrics, it has to go much further. You have to take real decisions. That’s why we don’t do promotions at Ecoalf. We don’t do discounts. We don’t overproduce. Which means we lose a lot of sales as we don’t overstock,” he explains.
 
Back in 2014 Ecoalf discontinued their best-selling item – a polar fleece. “Because it is the worst material in the world. Why? Because it is made of broken filament. So, every time you wash a polar fleece you put 20,000 tiny filaments back into water.”
 
Now, Ecoalf only works with continuous filaments, and does not mix materials, which makes things more complicated. 
“We began by making T-shirts in recycled cotton and recycled polyester, 50/50. But then we realized that this was a disaster for the circular economy, so from 2016 we stopped that. You have to accept that certain decisions are not commercially positive in terms of profitability. But you have to take them,” underlines the eco entrepreneur, who speak fluent English, albeit with a powerful accent.

""I was in Uniqlo in London recently, and they had a wall that said the most sustainable denim. But for me it was not. Because their denim was made from a company whose denim has an inside yarn of polyester surrounded by cotton. So, it can never be recycled. And on the opposite wall, you have 30 meters of polar fleece, claiming they save so much water, but in fact it is the worst thing for the water you can have!"", he says, his face darkening.
 
Goyeneche notes that cotton from recycled jeans is that it is often very weak – which is why people put in polyester. But that means that the material can only be recycled up to 15%. So Ecoalf does not produce denim.
 
Despite, the ethical restraints on certain product categories, Ecoalf is booming. Last year, sales totaled 39 million euros, and Javier predicts over 50% growth in 2022.
 
Ecoalf opened its first store in Madrid in 2013, with the backroom as Goyeneche’s office.  Now, they have six – including Barcelona - with plans to open in Milan this year. While their latest visit to Pitti, saw them boost Italian retail sales point to over 200.
 
They own no plants and like to manufacture garments where they collect the waste. Like nylon nets in Spain, or recycled cotton in Portugal, explained the CEO, showing off recycled fishing nets made into smooth midnight blue swimming togs, and a great chic belted raincoat with a stiff finish. 
“I love polyamide and I even prefer it to polyester!” he enthuses. “The problem is that we don’t have enough fishing nets, even working along the Spanish Mediterranean coats, around to Cadiz and even in northwest Galicia on the Atlantic.  Next month, we start working in France, we already are in Greece and Italy. Before when fishermen pulled up their nets, they used to throw the waste back in ocean. Now they save it for us!”
 
Once a week, Ecoalf trucks gather the waste from scores of ports, and then take it to categorization plants, allowing 68% of the waste back into their system. Besides recycling, Ecoalf uses all sorts of unexpected materials. There is even a charming fabric made from the dead fruit of India’s Kapok tree, used in their new premium Ecoalf 1.0 collection. While their labels come with QR codes, providing precise information on textile composition in multiple languages.
 
Defining its DNA as innovation, sustainability and design, Goyeneche shows off key looks, from great puffers to beautiful Indian linen shirts. Ecoalf may not be terribly very fashion forward; but its silhouettes are certainly flattering; its materials intriguing and its goals worthy.

"Feb 14, 2022","Olivier Rousteing has agreed to become the “fashion godfather” of Istituto Marangoni in Paris in 2022, creating a privileged collaboration between the artistic director of Balmain and the fashion college.
 The collaboration between the Marangoni and Balmain will take multiple formats throughout the year, the college explained in a release.
 
In April, Rousteing, artistic director of Balmain for over of a decade, will address 450 students in a special Masterclass, to discuss his journey and answer questions. During the year, Olivier will also reflect with the teaching staff at Marangoni on their different programs offered at the school and ideas on how to develop them.“Not so long ago, the most influential people in the fashion world never imagined
that someone like me could find himself at the head of the collections of one of the most emblematic of Paris. But times are changing. The generations that preceded me worked to open doors that have been closed for too long and thanks to them, I was able to enter and be part of a club hitherto as exclusive as it was excluding. I have to honor them and that's why I'm more than determined to keep those doors wide open,” said Rousteing, an adopted son of African heritage who grew up in Bordeaux.
 
His link-up with Marangoni, marks the latest example of top-level mentorship at Marangoni, which in December announced that the acclaimed British editor, stylist and consultant Katie Grand would stage a series of masterclasses and workshops during the first academic semester.
 
In September, during Paris Fashion Week, students will also have the
opportunity to work on the Balmain Fashion Festival, a blend of runway show and live music performances that is a highlight of the French catwalk season. Finally, Maison Balmain will award a scholarship to one student to finance their year in Marangoni.
 
“I want to help future generations and ensure that the French fashion industry reflects diversity and beauty that we see every day in the streets of Paris today. I am proud to partner with Istituto Marangoni France to make this dream a reality,” added Rousteing.

"Feb 14, 2022","Nicky Zimmerman keeps on raising her game. What was once an easy to understand and eye-popping swimwear brand is now a fully-fledged fashion house. Nowhere more so than in its latest collection, revealed online over the weekend. 
Modernist nobility throughout the collection, from the kaleidoscope floral bell-sleeve gowns or matching pants and shirts in zodiac prints to patchwork floral gowns with Empire waists or cosmic zip-front sweaters.
 
The cast finished strolling through an empty art gallery with studded malachite headbands or elaborate stone chokers, all marching on velvet platform sandals or crescent satin loafers.Frequently cut with an imperial silhouette of peaked shoulders, long collars and puckered sleeves, in a great fashion statement, based around the astrological sketches of Anita Inverarity.
 
“There’s always been something so fun and intriguing to me about pop astrology and the idea that our personalities are influenced by our birth signs. We worked with artist Anita Inverarity on 12 key prints that represent each sign of the zodiac and have incorporated these across a variety of looks across the collection. We wanted it all to feel really eclectic with a sense of fun. We picked up the symbols and icons of the zodiac in our detailing and finishes and there’s a conscious clash of fabric textures in each look. It’s a collection that’s high on finer details. Maybe that’s a bit of the Virgo in me coming through!” said creative director Nicky Zimmermann of a collection she christened Stargazer. 
For more casual moments, wide leg macadamia pants and boyfriend’s cranberry check blazers or metallic knit halter neck tops. Though the heart of the matter was the big statement flouncy midi dresses in great cosmic mixes of multi-spliced florals and celestial orbs. Not infrequently, these were demanding looks, requiring a certain stylistic chutzpah to carry off. But if you have the grace and the gall, and most Zimmerman gals do, then you are going to love this collection.
 
Presented in a lookbook and sleek video in video under the direction of Michelle Jank, leading us to recall that on our first visit to Sydney Fashion Week two decades ago, Jank staged the best single show under her own label. Good to see her back, if perhaps she never went away.
 
Climaxed with a couple of sensational puff shouldered zodiac charm dresses in either emerald tulle or champagne lace this was a really first-rate fashion display.

"Feb 14, 2022","Although Kanye West and Julia Fox went all out on workwear at the recent Fashion Week, they aren't at the origin of this rising trend. Straight out of the early 20th century -- via the '90s -- workwear is currently making a comeback, driven by the interest of a whole generation for gender-fluidity, body positivity, authenticity and more sustainable fashion choices.Coveralls, uniforms and overalls in denim or canvas, with a multitude of pockets and other functional details, are among fashion's most popular pieces of the moment. Originating in the United States, workwear started making a comeback there a few months ago, in the midst of the pandemic, before spreading like wildfire to the rest of the world... or Europe, at least.

The phenomenon is such that many stars have already adopted workwear looks, from Kaia Gerber to Sydney Sweeney. The latter regularly swaps her glamorous gowns for coveralls as she embraces her passion for auto mechanics. As a result, Generation Z and Millennials are gradually starting to adopt the codes of workwear -- symbolic of the American workers' movement, and in line with several major trends of the moment. TikTokers are already going wild for the style, with no less than 150 million views for the #workwear hashtag and nearly 45 million for #workwearstyle.And you have to admit that workwear has everything it takes to rise to the heights of the most desirable -- and desired -- fashion items, especially for Generation Z. As well as being gender-fluid in essence -- whether it's a boiler suit or overalls -- workwear can also adapt to absolutely all body shapes and sizes. The cherry on the cake is that such garments are often billed as authentic and long-lasting, if only for the quality and durability of the materials used.

As a result of this comeback, once forgotten brands like Dickies and Carhartt -- both centenarians -- have made a remarkable return to the fashion scene in recent months. Workwear has always been at the heart of their DNA. In combination with more classic or even streetwear-infused styles, workwear could quickly become the trend of the year.

"Feb 12, 2022","New York Fashion Week aims to please. The shows officially kicked off Friday with a schedule that offered a spectrum of events, perhaps another way in which diversity, a major point of view for the week, plays out. From showcases, to digital shows, to live streams, to presentations, and a good old fashion runway. Even designers not debuting a new collection are getting involved via talks, panels and a retrospective of creative projects, such as the case of Rodarte, whose costume work was on display at Spring Studios. 

To add to an upbeat start, New York weather was dry, sunny and unseasonably warm. 
Highlights of the opening included a men’s showcase featuring Perry Ellis America, A. Potts, Stan, Teddy Vonranson, and William Frederick. Shayne Oliver returned to the runway to much aplomb. Standouts of the Friday/Saturday start include Proenza Schouler, Jason Wu, and Victor Glemaud.Proenza Schouler""It's important these days in such a chaotic moment to find beauty in that,"" said Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler, backstage immediately following the brand's Fall 2022 runway show.

""We explored form, shape especially at the hip, the hourglass thing. It was a collage of things, but we looked for something that felt different, felt new, and wasn't achieving a specific reference,"" he continued.  
Whatever chaos out there didn't seem to reach the runway. Those observing the collection witnessed serene beauty that delivered on the shape and form goal, by emphasizing the waist through modern corsetry created from knits.
 
To demonstrate, modern knitting machine techniques knit sideways, versus up and down, to form the sculptural seamless knits. ""It creates volume similar in construction to a ruffle,"" Hernandez added.The duo fused two bias-cut circular panels creating a tulip skirt with a pants effect to the knit corsetry. The blouson-effect skirt pants showed up throughout; on shirt-dresses with snap sleeves or a skirt paired with a lavender sequined top, a rare color choice for the brand.
 
The waist emphasis was reinforced on the tailoring with knit draped shawls and zipped corsets added on top. Stretch double-knits created tension with a taut asymmetrical buttoning effect. Hernandez explained they were seeking sensuality. ""We want fashion; we are tired of sweats and sneakers.”

But, don't dismay those who do; louche roll-top pants made the home sweatpants hack super chic, especially paired with a smoking tux jacket. Likewise, the tightly wrapped velour hoodie dressing paired under a jacket or as a part of a head-to-toe caped gown look gave off serious 30s Hollywood glam.
 
""We wanted to show dressing up again that feels contemporary with flat shoes and knitwear and ease,"" said Jack McCollough of Proenza Schouler, adding: ""We created clothes that also appeal to women of varying shapes and forms."" That also materialized in a runway full of a wide array of female character types. 
 
Hernandez reiterated the sensual aspect of the clothes. ""There is this body obsession these days, showing your body on social media. That got us thinking. How do we do our version of that? It not showing much but alluding to the hip, body and shape,"" noted Hernandez.

The most revealed was the shoulder in a series of strapless silhouettes, particularly striking in black with a white ruffle. This also extended to boots with molded toes that the duo said were inspired by friends who wear old Repetto slippers marked with the toe impressions from the wearer.
 
A nod to the chaos and the body was evidenced in the animal printed dresses that came complete with fabric printing 'glitches' which, in some cases, purposely etched out around the bust for a bra effect.
 
The show venue was a dream in the making for the duo, who said they had wanted to use The Brant Foundation Art Study Center's East Village location for years. In keeping with the arty feel, Eartheater, the experimental multi-instrumentalist, producer, composer, and vocalist, wrote a custom piece for the show, played by five violinists marking the brand's first foray into live music at a show. They recruited friend and author Ottessa Moshfegh to craft a collection narrative in the show notes, offering a glimpse of these calmly beautiful creatures and how they coolly navigate daily life.Helmut LangWith the current obsession with all things nineties, Helmut Lang should be having a moment. Images of the brand under its founder have been showing up on designer mood boards for several seasons of late. Today's Helmut Lang is in mood and energy, a far cry from that heyday, but rather the perfect answer to office-ready clothes for the modern man and woman who like their classics with a tweak.
 This season, the behind-the-scenes design duo for men's and women's wanted to explore tailoring while keeping in mind the comfort everyone has gotten used to since the pandemic, a theme carried forth from the Spring 2022 collection.

The answer for their men's and women's pants was a branded elastic band modeled after the waistband fusible detail. A women's tailored jacket was reimagined as a camisole or arrived with cut-outs at the waist and long enough to wear as a dress for the more daring. 

Classic staples such as bomber jackets and trench coats were explored in new ways; a trench coat cut in half, becoming a cropped jacket or a wrap skirt. Similar treatments were applied to a bomber jacket which materializes as a miniskirt, trim details at the collar and wrist of a men's tailored wool overcoat, or oversized and reproportioned as a jacket.

These separates would appeal to the Sacai fan who can't stomach those prices. Shearling jackets, especially dominant in burnt orange or a patched vest, also played heavy into the assortment. In keeping with the brand's art theme, the collection was displayed in a Soho gallery with a mise-en-scene created by set designer Mila Taylor Young, all in keeping with Lang's cool legacy.Jason Wu 
Jason Wu feels like getting dressed up. “We want to look good and feel good,” said Jason Wu post-show backstage at his Fall 2022 collection. “I want to be out and feel chic and fancy, “ he continued, pointing out that he and his husband of 16 years were planning Valentine’s Day dinner out for the first time in over 12 years. “Don’t get me wrong, I still like to be in my sweatshirt and watch 'Emily in Paris', but it’s time to get chic.”
 So do his customers. “We cannot keep a dress in stock,” he continued. “During the first year of the pandemic, no one was buying clothes like this, and then last March, something snapped. The fancier, the dressier, the more gorgeous dresses sold. Boom, done!”

He said it was the best year for his business which launched in 2007 and gained international attention when First Lady Michelle Obama wore a dress he designed for the first (and second) inauguration.
 
Fall 2022 will deliver more hit dresses, heavy on ‘all eyes on me’ statement cocktail dress styles that explored volume in various ways. According to show notes, inspiration came from ‘hand-drawn fashion illustrations from the 1950’s’ and was a ‘collection that was an homage to American couture craftsmanship.’ Certainly, haute couture names from all decades were paid homage. Differing from Jason Wu, a contemporary-focused daywear line, his Jason Wu Collection is the upscale line. “It’s my version of couture.""
 
Using moiré ottoman taffeta and bold warp prints, the designer showed oversized bows, grand tiers, puffed egg shapes, peplum waistbands on an array of dresses that came with sexy short hemlines or a three-quarter length tiered ruffled skirt. Strapless necklines, bandeaus, and crop tops cuts added modernity, as did the waterproofing treatment on these fabrics and puffer fabric used as a skirt.  
 
The black-and-white palette was interspersed using hot pink, saffron yellow, royal purple, and Kelly green for an extra fresh take. Wu’s penchant for lingerie-inspired pieces was evidenced in flocked velvet tulle, which sprayed across several dress styles and was captivating in pale pink. A sober black-and-white tweed with shredded fringe details offered a more subtle option for dress-up. The show was dedicated to his late cat Jinxy; obviously, a sad moment for the designer, though joy was the emotion he channeled.Victor Glemaud 
In April 2021, Victor Glemaud made costumes for the ‘La Folia Variations’ ballet at American Ballet Theater. This creative exercise planted a seed for the designer whose eponymous women’s line, like his former menswear collection, is centered around knits. “How do we take that idea and meld it into the knitwear?” the designer asked himself. “That was the inspiration of it all,” he adds, referring to the collection that pushed the idea of knitwear further for the label that debuted in 2016.
 “We used cut-and-sew wovens but seamlessly melded them with knitwear.”

He achieved the effect by using a ponte jersey for the first time. “Donna Karan used this back in the day,’ he pointed out. “We took this new yarn and removed any surface texture, pattern, and special knits so everything blended. You couldn’t always tell if it was a sewn dress or not.”
 
This allowed the designer to explore Hollywood dresses, aka with a fishtail or train hemline, while in the past, knit dresses were confined to the constraints of the knits, not easy to incorporate volume. “Now we can broaden what we do and showcase the brand,” he continued. “I’ve always done knitwear because I love it, and I push myself to make it not always feel like a sweater.”
 
The exact nature of the dresses may have had an illusionary nature to them, but what was crystal clear was the shape and form, both sensual and graphic, the dresses possessed. Each was done in a solid color—café au lait, chocolate, brown, black, White, and two shades of orange—with details such as revealing one-shoulder and asymmetrical necklines, keyhole details, and ruching.
 
The casting was extraordinary and made for the collection’s powerful statement. Glemaud took inspiration from the 1966 Senegalese movie 'Black Girl' directed by Ousmane Sembène. “I contacted our casting director in December and with the directive dark skin models. It wasn’t as easy as it looked,” he notes.
 
Exploring the nature of knits versus woven wasn’t the only new territory Glemaud ventured in. This season, he teamed up with Pologeorgis furs and styled a few mink bathrobe coats over some dresses.
 
“Fur has a legacy in black culture and history,” he explains, adding, “I didn’t want to shy away from that, and the film inspires this collection. Let's show that history. It wasn’t about using faux fur.”

He argued fur is a natural substance, sustainable, and can be handed down to other generations, and is better than wearing faux fur, which is synthetic and plastic.
 
“There is a shamefulness these days around fur and if you will be this or that because of it. I don’t want to worry about that. I’m a black man living in America; my life is in danger 24/7,” he continued, putting this controversial choice of materials into context.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 11, 2022","Cruise collections are back in full swing. It is now Louis Vuitton's turn to announce a fascinating, far-off destination, following behind Chanel (to be held in Monaco on May 5) and Max Mara (in Lisbon on June 28). The star fashion house of LVMH is heading to California, USA, where it will unveil its collection on Thursday, May 12.The exact location is yet to be revealed. To present its 2023 cruise collection, Louis Vuitton specified in a press release that it ""will continue its architectural journey of showcasing cruise collections in exclusive locations of exceptional design and renown around the world.""

Last year, the brand remained within the vicinity of Paris and streamed its show, which was held in the new city of Cergy-Pontoise. Just before the arrival of Covid, in 2019, it showcased in the legendary TWA terminal of the New York airport JFK, built in 1962 by the Finnish architect Eero Saarinen.Other modern architecture gems have served as a stage for Vuitton in recent years such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Niterói, Brazil (Oscar Niemeyer’s last masterpiece) in 2016 and the Miho Museum north of Kyoto (designed by the Louvre pyramid’s star architect, Ieoh Ming Pei) the following year.

"Feb 11, 2022","Global fashion shopping app Lyst has launched an interesting new trends roundup with the debut of Born Online. On a monthly basis, it looks at “the newest, hottest fashion trends born from internet subcultures”. It said that “trends coming from TikTok and other social platforms are becoming more powerful and even influencing the industry as a whole”. So pairing its bespoke data from 160 million shoppers with cultural analysis and social media tracking, it believes it’s “uniquely placed to explore the new energy of digital fashion culture today and predict what's next”.

The new Born Online Chart highlights the three youth-led movements that have caused the biggest impact in fashion each month. That judgement is based on their “virality (hottest, moving fast and emerging), and given context by data-driven insights and a bespoke algorithm”.So, looking at what happened in the early weeks of the year, what’s the verdict for its February report? The Hottest winner for February is the 2010s style blogger look that’s “taking over luxury fashion”. It said online searches for Balenciaga’s City bag on Lyst increased 37% month-on-month during January.

Top of the Moving Fast list is brown, which is “positioning itself as Gen Z’s preferred colour. With a 32% increase in searches for brown clothing in January, compared to the same time last year”. Lyst thinks it could be “the new Millennial pink”.

And under the Emerging trend tag, it said “Grunge is back, this time mixed with high fashion items”. Searches for ‘plaid shirts’ grew 200% month-on-month last month, and demand for men’s chunky knits rose 69% in December.

The January list meanwhile, called out “Indie Sleaze” as the Hottest trend with skinny jeans (+20% on Lyst since November 2021) and sheer tops (+35%), making a comeback. Meanwhile, the Moving Fast trend for January was Euphoria. Crystal-embellished catsuits (+12%), cut-out pieces (+15%) and see-through tops (+11%) were all trending on Lyst, a week after Euphoria Season 2 premiered. Labels such as Nensi Dojaka, Poster Girl, Miaou and Dion Lee were popular here. 

And the key Emerging trend was Magic Gorpcore. It said the ‘gorpcore’ aesthetic “has evolved and taken a kaleidoscopic turn, with bright colours, psychedelic prints and creative combinations”.

This season’s report highlights ten standout colors as well as current takes on five core classics expected to see as fashion designers introduce new Autumn/Winter collections.

Experts at the Pantone Color Institute said that this season’s colors “reflect our hybridized lifestyles and our contradictory yearnings as we continue forward into this new landscape.” Colors for Autumn/Winter 2022/2023 are both nurturing and restorative, with shades like Martine Olive, Midnight, Caramel Cafe, Watersprout and Nosegay. Likewise, super bright colors expressing the celebration of life make up the line up including Lava Falls, an impassioned orange red, Cheerful Samoan Sun, Gregarious Orange Tiger, Vivid and vibrant Rose Violet, and green Amazon. 

Completing the report are classic, seasonless hues whose versatility express longevity such as Arctic Wolf, creamy Autumn Blonde, a cosmically inspired blue hue, Polar Night, Loden Frost, and non-presumptive Chiseled Stone. 

“Colors for Autumn/Winter 2022/2023 contrast our competing desires for calm and comfort with energy boosting vitality through a range of restful and restorative colors, in tandem with exuberant tones,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. 

“As we move forward into an environment filled with contradiction, hues for Autumn/Winter 2022/2023 enable consumers to move fluidly between a range of contrasting shades, allowing them to spontaneously express who they are and how they feel on any given day.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 10, 2022","Adidas is pursuing its commitment to sustainable development with a first-ever hoodie incorporating wood-based fibers. Aimed at hikers, and in tune with nature, this model is the result of a long-term partnership with the Finnish start-up Spinnova, and will be available in a limited edition this summer.After releasing the first low-carbon performance shoe with the Allbirds brand, adidas is making every effort to reduce plastic waste from its collections. Eight months after announcing its partnership with Spinnova, a manufacturer of eco-friendly fabrics awarded the prestigious ANDAM innovation award, the sports equipment manufacturer presents its first marketable product. It is a hoodie with a part of its fabric made from wood-based fibers.

In more detail, this new breed of sweater is composed of 25% wood-based fibers and organic cotton. Called ""Terrex HS1,"" it is a multifunctional piece for hikers that can be rolled up into its hood to optimize storage, or can be used as a pillow for those nights spent in the wild.This hoodie is the first in a long line of products from this ongoing partnership between adidas and Spinnova. The brand with the three stripes aims to create at least nine in 10 items with more sustainable technology, materials or manufacturing processes by 2025. In the meantime, the wood-fiber hoodie will go on sale in a limited number from July 2022.

"Feb 9, 2022","All about redefining what it means for a man to be dressed up today at Amiri, as the house stages its latest runway show at a mecca of the Los Angeles Art District. 
Shot in the archive of Wes Lang, a defining talent in the Antagonist school of artists, where the backdrop was a whole series of his urban mottos, from Never Felt So Good Before to Trust In Your Own Greatness. Either of which would do as taglines for Amiri, the happening West Coast label.
 
“I’m sharing my world with my friends. A live show in LA, in our city. Our first in our hometown. A great occasion for a lot of people who could not make it to our Paris runway show,” explained founder Mike Amiri in a pre-show Zoom.Opening this fall/winter 2022 collection with tobacco-hued trenches over matching botched patchwork print shirts and pants; suede jerkins and cardigans; knee-length long scarves; bold graphic knits and lots of man bags and mini satchels.
 
Though the heart of the matter were the great punchy prints and portraits by Lang of noble Native Americans, death-figures; gritty ghouls; blotchy flowers; or dark ornithology, in the latter case splayed onto paisley Madras shirts.
 
“Aside from the collab, I wanted to continue a conversation about modern menswear, beyond the conversation of post-pandemic comfort. People today always have a sense of duality - working at home and living outside all in the context of a single day. So, I asked, how do you do that in a more refined look in all those scenarios?” added the designer.
 
His response: lightened up tailoring, from clever redingote versions of black leather hoodies; or dramatic micro-check or chessboard print blousons, jackets and trousers in contrasting dimensions. Best of all, the two final rocker redingotes plastered with Lang’s defiant, badass images. Red-carpet royalty.
 
Mike’s a talented tailor too, who works in elevated fabrics with lighter wools, and removes multiple interior structures to create more leisurely silhouettes - combining suits and blazers with knits and T-shirts.
 
“A suit is not the only option to make a man look dressed up and put together,” insisted Amiri, perched in his living room, beside gently illuminated bottles of fine Californian wine.
 
The house Amiri has started its international expansion, with a planned opening in Shanghai this year, and it is now looking at potential spaces in Europe.
 
“We are tentatively studying some major cities – not to have too many boutiques so the brand feels special. We are an independent brand that sits in a world alongside houses that are 80 to 100 years old. Though we want modern luxury to look less like a corporate and more like an individual,” he concluded.

"Feb 8, 2022","Nicolai Marciano, son of Guess’s co-founder and head of the US label’s product development, has announced a new incarnation of the Guess USA sub-brand (in 2016 and 2017, Marciano launched Guess Originals and Guess USA, both managed by Guess’s Los Angeles office), which specialises in collaborations and premium apparel.For the Fall-Winter 2022 collection, Marciano drew his inspiration from the aesthetics of the American West and the iconography of the early Guess campaigns, with “items that are normally found in road-side craft shops in America, featuring worn leather, washed jeans and sun-bleached fur,” said the designer.
 
While nothing has yet been disclosed about the collection, Marciano recently released on Guess USA’s newly overhauled Instagram account a first pic from the label’s 1980s archives. It is just a concept image, not focused on specific clothes, one that was highly successful as an advertising campaign staple for Guess 40 years ago, and will be given a new twist in the next few weeks by talented photographer Eli Russell Linnetz. Linnetz, well-known for having directed the videos for Kanye West's ‘Famous’ and ‘Wade’ hits, for the set design of Lady Gaga's Enigma tour, and for his graphic design work for Comme des Garçons, will be delving into the history of Guess, “a brand that has always used photography to tell amazing stories, stories that not only sold clothes but also an exciting attitude and energy,” as Linnetz explained.
 
Drawing from the label’s photo archive, Linnetz and Marciano are keen to replicate the vibe and “sexy attitude” that were the hallmark of Guess's brand image at its inception. Milanese showroom Slam Jam will be in charge of distribution for the Guess USA collections.

"Feb 8, 2022","Italian label Trussardi, owned since February 2019 by asset management firm QuattroR, has embarked on a fresh course under the aegis of new CEO Sebastian Suhl and the new creative director duo of Serhat Işık and Benjamin A. Huseby, the brains behind independent Berlin label GmbH.

Trussardi has recently unveiled a new logo and image strategy, while the first collection by the two designers will be presented during the forthcoming Milan Fashion Week on February 26, at Palazzo Trussardi alla Scala, the historic building home to the label’s offices and Milanese flagship store, currently undergoing renovation work.The building will be given a complete make-over and new look, and is set to re-open in the second part of the year, becoming another key element in the label's new brand identity. The first stage of Trussardi’s rejuvenation is the introduction of a redesigned logo with a “contemporary, timeless” feel. The lettering in ‘Trussardi’ has subtly changed, still faithful to the original but taking on a more “harmonious, well-spaced” form, while the house logo, the famous greyhound, has been instead entirely redesigned in a circular, ring-like shape akin to a uroboros, the mythical symbol of a serpent or dragon biting its tail.

The greyhound design had been chosen as the long-established Italian label’s logo in 1973, for its sophisticated, sporting allure. Trussardi, a glove maker founded in Bergamo in 1911, was at the time diversifying in all directions and turning into a genuine lifestyle brand, and was one of the first labels to pick a highly recognisable symbol for its brand identity. In 2014, a greyhound wearing the label’s products took centre stage in a memorable advertising campaign for Trussardi.In the last few years, Trussardi has changed tack several times, essentially relying on its archives to create new collections. More recently, the management team has been strengthened and the post of creative director has been introduced, the label now deliberately targeting a multi-generational audience and adopting values like social and environmental responsibility, diversity and inclusivity.

Trussardi is focused exclusively on the main line and has radically streamlined its distribution network, which now consists of some 60 monobrand stores and about 30 franchised ones, as well as 900 multibrand retailers, while it has made significant progress with its e-tail presence. Italy is Trussardi’s main market, followed by Russia, East Europe and China.

Ready-to-wear accounts for half of the label’s sales, and the rest is generated by leather goods, especially footwear and handbags, by watches, fragrances - managed under licence by Angelini Beauty - and the home decoration line.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 8, 2022","In a major surprise, Paris Fashion Week organizers announced Monday that The Row, one of New York’s most significant runway brands, will stage its next catwalk show in Paris.Besides The Row, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode also revealed Monday evening in Paris that there would be six new entrants onto the official schedule of the next women’s ready-to-wear season in Paris, due to run from February 28 through March 8.

Most notably, VTMNTS, the diffusion line of Vetements, the highly influential, indie fashion house founded by the two Georgian refugee brothers Demna and Guram Gvasalia. The Federation added that Ester Manas and Germanier, two French houses; Austria’s Petar Petrov and another American label Vaquera will also enter the official calendar.However, it will be The Row which will ignite the greatest media attention - serious, social and otherwise. Founded in 2006 by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, two former TV child actor stars, The Row has managed to be both a cult insider brand and a commercial success. More importantly, their enveloping silhouette, minimalist style and sense of understated empowerment helped ignite a whole movement in fashion. The ultimate proof of the relevance of The Row, which was named after Savile Row, in reference to the twin’s respect for tailoring and classic savoir faire.

The move to stage a VTMNTS show in Paris will be seen by many as the latest confirmation of a major rift between brothers Demna and Guram Gvasalia. With creative director Demna fully committed to his position as creative director of Balenciaga, Guram has taken over the role of designer of Vetements, the cooperative brand they launched together in 2014 in Paris. Another indication of declining brotherly love is that Guram is no longer mentioned in Demna’s Wikipedia page.

“This season, 95 houses are listed on the official calendar. The official calendar includes 45 physical shows, 37 physical presentations (82 physical events) and 13 digital-only events. The formats are specified on the official calendar,” the Federation confirmed in an official release.

“Formats will depend on the evolution of health situation and measures taken by public authorities,” cautioned the Federation, French high-fashion’s governing body.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 7, 2022","Fashionistas will be accessorising their outfits with mandatory masks to attend New York Fashion Week this season, adhering to strict COVID-19 protocols put in place for smaller catwalk shows.With a return to physical shows in September following virtual fashion weeks earlier in the pandemic, organisers are embracing a ""new normal"" mix of in-person and digital presentations.

Designers like Michael Kors, Carolina Herrera and Christian Siriano will present their latest creations live during the Feb. 11 - 16 event, according to IMG Fashion which runs New York Fashion Week: The Shows.Others like Badgley Mischka and Tadashi Shoji will provide digital releases, all keen to capitalise on soaring demand for luxury goods as customers splash out following lockdowns.

""It's the new normal. This season there will be indoor mask wearing that'll be a requirement across all shows, proof of vaccination, that will be a must,"" Noah Kozlowski, director of designer relations and development at IMG Fashion, told Reuters.

""Those who are eligible to be boosted will be required to show proof of doing so. If not, they'll have to provide a PCR test within 48 hours or an Antigen test within six hours.""Like last season, guest lists are smaller with about 200 spectators expected on average.

""The biggest challenge will be for the decision makers of who gets to attend the shows since across the board there will be decreased capacities similar to what we saw last season,"" Kozlowski said.

Some designers are absent from the schedule. Tom Ford cancelled his show while Thom Brown postponed his to April due to COVID-19.

New York, which kicks off the seasonal catwalk calendar, is known for established brands and newer streetwear labels.

""American fashion has never been as powerful as it (is) right now,"" Women's Wear Daily style director Alex Badia said.
After New York, fellow fashion capitals London, Milan and Paris also plan busy in-person show schedules.

"Feb 4, 2022","After two years of restrictive measures due to the pandemic, Milan Women’s Fashion Week will return in an almost entirely physical format. The Italian Chamber of Fashion (CNMI) announced along with the publication of its provisional calendar that the event will present no less than 71 shows; 65 live shows and only six presented digitally. The week-long event dedicated to women’s ready-to-wear collections for Fall/Winter 2022-23 will take place from February 22 to 28. All the major Italian brands will make an appearance, from Armani to Cavalli, Prada, Moschino, Dolce & Gabbana, Missoni, among others. Bottega Veneta will make a memorable come back along with Gucci, Trussardi, Plein Sport, and Dsquared2, which will once again present its men's and women's collections separately. In addition to these brands, two notable newcomers will showcase their collections for the very first time in the Lombardy capital: Diesel, under the creative direction of Glenn Martens, and Ferrari, which recruited designer Rocco Iannone last June to help launch its new luxury fashion line. 

The spotlight will shine on the new young names participating, starting with the very cool Japanese label, Ambush, founded by American-Korean designer Yoon Ahn together with her partner Verbal (DJ, producer, and Japanese hip-hop star) who usually present their collections in Paris but opted for a change of scenery this season. Another noteworthy entrant to the women’s edition of fashion week is Palm Angels, Francesco Ragazzi’s high-end streetwear brand which up until now has showcased its collections during the men’s week. The other brands debuting their first “physical” presence in the Milanese catwalks include AC9, Andreadamo, Aniye Records, Cormio, Hans Kjøbenhavn, Onitsuka Tiger and Tokyo James, all of which have already been part of the fashion week’s presentation calendar or have participated digitally. 

The CNMI stated in a press release that, according to the latest implemented health regulations, ""fashion shows, presentations and events can be held in person, provided that the procedures and protocols to avoid the spread of Covid-19 virus are applied, including an obligatory presentation of a health pass and the wearing of a FFP2 mask mandatory for all attendees.” 

The Italian fashion industry is also pleased with the recent measure adopted by the government on Thursday, February 3, which “allows buyers from countries where the vaccines are not recognized by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) to participate in the next Milan fashion shows.” Russians vaccinated with Sputnik, in particular, were not allowed to travel to the European peninsula in January to attend Pitti Uomo nor the Men’s Fashion Week.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 4, 2022","A new name in the Paris Men’s Fashion Week agenda has grabbed people’s attention: Rains. The Danish rainwear brand presented its first Parisian show at the Palais de Tokyo on January 20. This came as a challenge, but the label founded by Daniel Brix Hesselager and Philip Lotko in 2012 was able to successfully showcase its essence, incorporating a streetwear approach to its functional clothing and demonstrating a mastered Scandinavian aesthetic. The two founders, who met when studying at the Teko design school, have also made it clear through this show that Rains is no longer limited to just rainwear. The initiative to diversify its product range started several seasons ago and has since allowed the brand to offer, under the leadership of its creative director Tanne Vinter, stylish silhouettes that bridge the gap between technical outdoor clothing and streetwear. 

""Rains brings a Scandinavian aesthetic into an urban lifestyle by blending utility and design with a streetwear approach through details and its brand expression,"" said Hesselager. “We've made great strides in the last few years and have big ambitions for the future. A runway show was not a new experience for us since we have been presenting our collections in this format since the Fall/Winter 2020 season at Copenhagen Fashion Week. But this year we were ready for the truly global stage that is Paris Fashion Week. Our presence in Paris comes in parallel with an evolutionary and important step for our brand, which is shifting our focus from rainwear to transitional outerwear.” In a span of just a few years, the brand has established itself in the main European markets and is currently sold in around 2,500 multi-brand retailers worldwide as well as in its own 26 stores, which include two in Paris, one in Bordeaux and one in Lille. The French market, entrusted to The Clothette showroom and sales agency, is one of the label’s main markets, along with the UK, Denmark, Germany and the US. Rains, which still generates 58% of its business through its retailers, 20% through e-commerce and 12% through its stores, is expected to make good progress in its 2021 results.""In 2021, Rains exceeded €80 million in turnover,” explained Daniel Brix Hesselager, “with an annual growth of 50%, mainly due to developments in the European markets.""

The brand is still very much focused on the European continent, where it generates nearly three-quarters of its business. Its second main area of activity, which accounts for 10% of its sales, is North America. China, where the brand has two stores in Shanghai, currently represents only 5% of its sales. Seducing these international and export markets is precisely the motive behind the brand’s decision to walk down the Parisian catwalks. ""We feel like we reached a new audience, but also made those already familiar with Rains aware of the direction we've taken in recent years. For those who don't know the details of Rains' journey, the show helped visualize the breadth and depth of the universe we've built.""

The Danish label intends to deploy this vision to the United States this year with the announced installation of a new flagship store in New York along with the development of its American headquarters in New Jersey.

"Feb 4, 2022","Copenhagen Fashion Week, which ended Thursday evening, is arguably as famous for its street style photos as the actual runway shows and brands on display. Though judging on this week’s shows, its primary role is as much as a junket for junior influencers.  
One cannot fault designers for effort or enthusiasm, but judging from this week’s catwalks there is a reason the photography of guests outside shows are more followed than models on the runways. The shows and the brands are highly erratic. 
 
There were a small handful of strong shows – notably Soeren Le Schmidt, (di)vision, Wood Wood and Henrik Vibskov – but overall no one could possibly describe this as a vintage season in the Danish capital. Most of the time, it seemed designed to humor obscure influencers rather than professional fashion retailers or editors. Some strong ideas did emerge – abundant puffer gilets and accessories; quirky two-piece shoes; industrial finishing; endless green plaid; survival-chic layering and the really ginormous boot. However, the fashion muse didn’t sing with any great cadence in Denmark this week.
 
Far too often the clothes looked like poor copies of influential designers in London, Milan and Paris, all jumbled up together. Dollops of Rick Owens; lots of Off/White; elements of Y-3; a soupcon of JW Anderson and a dash or two of Supreme.
 
The opening evening on Monday did have two strong statements by Soeren Le Schmidt and (di)vision. The first was ingeniously staged inside a carousel within the city’s most famous tourist destination – Tivoli Gardens.
 Soeren Le SchmidtModels posed inside various fairytale tableaux wearing oversized tuxedos with contrasting piping;  satin sports jackets; off-the-shoulder frocks and blazer-dresses. Nothing terribly new, but at least a great Instagram moment, which is never to be sneered at in fashion.
 (di)visionAnd full marks to (di)vision, which describes itself as a “multi-disciplinary brand” founded by the siblings Nanna & Simon Wick. They pulled off a double whammy inside the capital’s Planetarium, showing their link-up with Adidas, an NFT named The Ozzy Drop, a bug-eyed downtown dude avatar. By scanning a QR code and entering a raffle, 10 lucky fashionistas attending the season could end up with a free Ozzy outfit. Besides an insouciant lookbook video, the brand also staged a clever show and strong collection: including crazy mega color-block clubbing parkas and spy coats and excellent rolled-down-at-the-waist denim jeans. 
 Samsøe SamsøeAnd, if you want a good example of Danish cool, then check out Samsøe Samsøe. Nothing very revolutionary, but well-made, fresh and flattering clothes. Plus, they made an excellent lookbook video, faintly claustrophobic in a  Samuel Beckett sort of way, of models marching around a never-ending corridor in natty chunky check mohair tops; one-shoulder dresses and degrade silk slip dresses. The Samsøe Samsøe after-party also boasted a fantastic DJ and cool inclusive crowd, a brand with its finger on the pulse.
 Wood WoodVery much a clubber's mecca, Copenhagen often featured live music at shows, notably Wood Wood, where two ace DJs worked a dark space underneath massive light zeppelins. Featuring gutsy graphic blousons and coats in a collab with local fine artists; striped hoodies with matching pants; perfectly cut oversized pants and some great broken-pattern cable sweaters – half them in midnight blue. Plus, in a city obsessed by clunky boots, they had the best idea – reinforced wellingtons, sturdy chic at its best.
 Henrik VibskovIn another snappily staged show, Henrik Vibskov was at his quirkiest best. Historically, the first indie Scandinavian designer to be listed on the official Paris runway schedule, Vibskov has always had very specific aesthetic – eye catching arty. In a former warehouse bedecked with knee light pillows, we witnessed New England plaid suits skillfully cut with dhotis; samurai padded waistcoats and cocktails; and lots of great orange and plaid knubby wool coats, one worn on a veteran Jean-Luc Godard lookalike model. Models also marched on roped together futurist platforms, where the toe and the heel were physically separated. 
 Saks PottsAny time one lamented to locals how underwhelming the current season was, they tended to respond by asking if we had seen Saks Potts. Though their Danish accents made the name sound like Sex Pot. Actually, Saks Potts was Scandi fashion doing what it does best – spruce, smartly-tailored outerwear for self-confident ladies. Clever color blocking an unerring palette and sense of modernist taste - polished professionalism from founders Cathrine Saks and Barbara Potts.
 GanniScandi fashion’s single most followed fashion house is probably Ganni, based in Copenhagen and run by the husband-and-wife team creative director Ditte Reffstrup and dounder Nicolaj Reffstrup. No show this season, but the season’s best video that starred a local singer, and was flooded with '90s nostalgia – featuring rockstar cut-off jean jackets and wide pants tucked into boots; aqua blue rouched silk cocktails  and low-cut come-hither cheesecloth blouses. A tad raunchier than Ganni’s often Victorian-inspired look, but none the worse for that. “There’s a big yearning for the '90s, and all the freedom we associated with that decade. Plus, all my design team have been watching Euphoria,” laughed Ditte, referring to the music-driven new cult series.  
 
Elsewhere, however, one had to wade through a great deal of style facileness.
 Baum und PferdgartenBaum und Pferdgarten showed matelassé flounce skirts, volume coats and truly dreadful shorts; slightly askew blouses; predictable trenches and chunky cable knits. What’s the Danish for utterly banal? It turns out to be fuldstaendig pinligt, which sounds pretty awful when you say it out loud. Just like this collection.
 SoullandThe omens looked good for Soulland, which staged its show inside a giant train repair depot, as a fine saxophonist played Albert Ayler-style jazz. But the clothes were far from Soulland, more soulless. Biliously baggy work; odd faux dhotis; disproportioned blazers and sad pajama suits. 
 Martin AsbjørnNothing terribly wrong with local boy Martin Asbjørn, who can drape, and is a respectable tailor who leavened his collection with some great metallic leather looks. However, like the season itself, it left you longing for a lot more.
 
All told, one spent three days with gray skies; minus-zero temperatures, and on Thursday morning a fog so dense that guests in the two-tower Bella Ski hotel – which housed many editors and buyers - could not see the other twisting tower from their room windows just 40 meters away.
 
The long winter clearly influences local style, and its need for color.   Those who have visited Galway or Kerry in the rainy west of Ireland, or spent a winter in the snow of St Petersburg, will understand the syndrome. But where the Irish and the Russians paint their cottages and palace bright sherbet colors, the Danes alter the colors of their clothes.
 
Finally, a straw poll of a half dozen savvy and experienced Italian boutique owners was pretty damning.
 
“The big problem is that there is no real DNA here, no real identity. Just interpreting and following better designers elsewhere,” lamented one owner. “Yes, we will pick up brands, but less than before and probably not stock them for so long,” added another. “The big problem in Copenhagen was there was not very much new,” sniffed a third.

"Feb 4, 2022","Iso.Poetism by Tobias Birk Nielsen has been announced as the winner of the Zalando Sustainability Award during Copenhagen Fashion Week with the label’s “approach to sustainability and use of innovative dyeing techniques [having] stood out from the competition”.It will now work with Zalando to create an exclusive collection “to further explore more sustainable design options”.

This was the third season of a three-year strategic partnership between Zalando and CFW, many built around the award that “aims to encourage fashion brands to explore alternative approaches to design and production to contribute to a more sustainable fashion industry”.The runners-up, Fassbender and Tomorrow Denim, were also recognised by the jury as “outstanding examples of brands that inspire and integrate sustainability throughout the entire supply chain while creating well-constructed fashion pieces that are wardrobe heroes”.

The jury said the winning collection showcased at CFW “displayed the brand’s ethos to recycle whenever possible”. The label will now receive a prize of €20,000 as well as that partnership with Zalando. The new collection they create will leverage more sustainable design solutions across materials, production processes, technological solutions and traceability. 

And importantly for Iso.Poetism, Zalando will make much of the AW22 collection available to its more than 46 million customers across 23 European markets.

Tobias Birk Nielsen said taking part in the award was “a precious learning process and a great experience. Until now we've been taking sustainable decisions as part of a natural and logical process, and have been focusing on how to implement them internally in everything from the design process to our logistical footsteps. But being part of this has pushed us to start programming our sustainable approaches, disseminating and communicating them and our sustainable ideas not only internally - but also outside of our little busy work bubble”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 4, 2022","Tod’s has launched an exciting new collaboration project with students from Instituto Marangoni’s two Italian campuses, in Florence and Milan, which starts today. 
Entitled Tod’s Re-Generation, the collab links Tod’s with students in Istituto Marangoni in both Florence and Milan.
 
This project launches one year after the Italian luxury marque unveiled Tod’s Legacy, a link-up with students from Central Saint Martins in London, in a “borderless selection” from the master’s course of the UK fashion school.“After the collaboration with Central Saint Martins in London, we had the desire to support an Italian school within Tod's Academy. Tod's Academy is a laboratory of ideas based in our HQ in the Marche region, imagined as a place for doing and thinking, in which our artisans accompany and support young people, offering them skills and techniques to make products. It is the expression of the highest culture of Made in Italy and is designed with a view to generational continuity, to give impetus to young creatives and help them in their growth path,” explained Carlo Alberto Beretta, Tod’s Brand Manager.
 
For its latest linkup Tod’s Academy has selected 20 students from either college in Milan and Florence, historically Italy’s two most important fashion capitals. The lucky score have already been working at Tod’s headquarters in the eastern Le Marche region of Italy since December. Giving them time to imagine, create and produce their first works, while being supported by high profile industry mentors. 
“At the heart of the Tod's Re-Generation project is sustainability. For Tod's Legacy, the first chapter of Tod's Academy in collaboration with Central Saint Martins, the young students were asked to give their own interpretation of one or more codes of our brand, focusing on the creative process that led to the final proposal. For Tod's Re-Generation, the young students of Istituto Marangoni were inspired by the values and DNA of Tod's, creating products with a strong focus on sustainability, an increasingly central theme for all the initiatives that our company has been undertaking for some time,"" added Carlo Alberto Beretta.
 
The 20 young talents who were invited into the project are Francesca Chavarri, Natalie Baekkel, Anahita Alebuoyeh, Efan Mousavi, Giorgio Cinosi, Leyla Babayeva, Maria Elvira Nates, Phoebe Adams, Pragya Wadhawan, Anita Elena Boiochhi, Salvatore Caropreso, Beatrice Da Costa, Qiongwen Qiao, Giuseppe Danza, Ritika Sankpal, Anna Chiara Mormille, Veronica Tanzillo, Ylenia Anna Caliri, Alexandre Baldissera and Shang Chun-Kai.
 
While the mentor team assembled by Tod’s was decidedly high profile. They are: Laura Brown, Editor in Chief of InStyle USA; Tonne Goodman, Sustainability Editor at Vogue USA; Gert Jonkers, Editor in Chief of Fantastic Man; Gianluca Longo, Style Editor of British Vogue and Style Director of The World of Interiors;  Sara Sozzani Maino, Head of Special Projects Vogue Italia and International Brand Ambassador Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana; and Simone Marchetti, Editor in Chief of Vanity Fair Italia and European editorial director of Vanity Fair. 
“During the journey within the Tod's Academy, students are supported by mentors, including some of the most prestigious international editors, authoritative characters whose point of view and whose knowledge are an invaluable help and enrichment for students,” stressed Carlo Alberto Beretta.
 
All of the students subtly played on key elements on the Tod’s DNA: the studded rubber gommino; the ever-present lion; leather; weekend boots and, of course multiple moccasins.
 
Baekkel’s theme entitled 'Hic Sunt Leones', or Here are the Lions, featured head of lion T-shirts and soft silk scarves. Alebuoyeh focused on the material cork, with post-modern platform clogs and sandals, and 'T'-trimmed totes.
 
Humor was important in many themes, like Mousavi’s space-age concept of techy spaceship Driver loafers, booties or sliders finished with gommino stubs. Like several students, Mousavi included a whole series of commercial strategies – from storytelling hashtags to guerilla marketing in urban Milan during the runway season.
 
Despite her name, Babayeva’s project 'Ride Out to the Old Sundown' was all about the Wild West, featuring cowboy boots with spurs; posh hiker boots with lion buckles; and suede Comanche moccasins with 'T-'patterned logo soles. Fellow student Adams looked to Venice, with a split platform sole Rain Boot inspired by 16th century Chopine shoes worn in the Lagoon City, designed to be displayed in a floating pop-up during the Venice Film Festival. 
 
Boiochhi combined fine jewelry and Italian movie legends to dream up courtly platforms with chunky crystal straps and trim, and ladylike purses in Zebra skin. While Sankpal concentrated on sculptural shapes in a very coherent display of ergonomic boots, sleek high-collar coats, and shoulder bags in alternative leathers made of Vegan Cactus. Her strategy called for a pottery workshop and dinner. Jour Zéro, a project by Caliri, focused on Tod’s iconic gommino, reinventing the moccasin as a knubby hipster shoe with huge rubber studs. Among the most striking new ideas from the new generation are a Dolomia bike pannier by Shang Chun Kai, with a 'T'-logo clip to attach to the bike, and a bag that offers both heat insulation and heat preservation; Vesuvio bike shoes and Acqurino hiking boots, often made in a zany patchwork leathers.
 
“These projects can enrich the Tod's world with further facets, new visions and new values,” concluded Carlo Alberto Beretta.

"Feb 4, 2022","For the first time in three years, Versace has presented its menswear separately from the women's ready-to-wear collection, with which the label had always unveiled its menswear in the last few seasons. The Italian label, owned by US group Capri Holdings, opted for a video format to herald its men's collection’s emphatic come-back, streaming it live online on Wednesday February 2 2022. A fast-paced short film showcasing the multiple facets of the new men's collection by Versace.In a nod to the presentation’s date, 2/2/2022, Creative Director Donatella Versace called it “the Versace 2.0 men's collection,” the label’s next-generation menswear. “I wanted to give even more importance to this new chapter by presenting it on the second day of the second month of 2022. It is about taking a step forward and looking towards the future, without focusing on the individual but on the collective, on evolution and diversity. The same values that characterise the young generations, which express their masculinity with such energy. This collection embraces all of this, and is targeted not to an individual Versace man, but to all Versace men,” said Donatella Versace in her collection statement.

The colours, bright, lively and imbued with fresh energy, are the collection’s first striking element. Golden orange hues monopolise jackets and coats in glossy satin, and a twin set in cable-knit wool. Purple is the colour for suits and trousers that are matched with teal green coats and two-tone, lozenge-patterned knitwear, or a pair of neon-pink trousers.In addition to the array of highly desirable monochrome items, like the minimalistic turquoise leather jacket, the collection features a series of motifs and prints in two and three-colour combinations: orange and violet, blue and violet, orange and pink, yellow, blue and black, and more. The label’s new monogram pattern, inspired by the fret motif of ancient Greek columns, Versace's new emblem, is notably printed on cardigans, on flowing trouser sets, and on shirts and bags. The label has also developed new leopard-spot patterns in bright colours, actually more akin to flowers, pansies for example.
 
The film, steeped in Versace’s sexy imagery as the models slouch on sofas in their finery, sculpted muscles prominent, features a mix of different male personae, all sharing a similar style, oozing a laid-back, subtly sophisticated elegance. The characters include businessmen in grey pinstripe or large-check suits, adventurers bare-chested under their gilets and biker jackets, duffel-coated students, and dandies elegantly layering one patterned shirt over another.

The lines of this Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection are generously comfortable, but their clean, essential cuts give them a chic edge. The clothes are soft, destructured, and cling almost sensually to the body. All the items are made in fine fabrics and can be easily combined with one another, allowing the looks to change and evolve depending on the mood.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 3, 2022","Stradivarius is refreshing its visual identity to be more in line with its current brand positioning. The Galician group’s strategic move aims to assert the young fashion retailer’s “own identity” by creating a new “more contemporary and refined” logo, designed together with the Barcelona-based studio Ana Mirats and written in a font that was created exclusively for the brand. Although the brand's image has undergone several changes since its birth in 1994, the company explained that it has always remained ""true to its essence: feminine and transforming.” This identity is preserved in Stradivarius’ new logo written in capital letters which “symbolize change and strength.”

The redesign remains true to the Inditex-owned brand’s identity, illustrating its two differentiating elements: the treble clef, a symbol reflecting the dynamism of the brand, and the personalized font designed to provide “readability and notoriety in a more contemporary style.” Stradivarius was founded as an independent brand by the Triquell family, who sold 90% of the company to Inditex for 18 billion pesetas (around €110 million) in 1999. Today, the retail chain managed by Jordi Triquell is the fifth largest brand in terms of turnover for the Galician conglomerate that is behind Zara, Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka. The brand closed the 2020 financial year with a total of 936 stores worldwide and a turnover of €1.283 billion, 26% lower than the sales recorded a year earlier.

In the first nine months of the year, Inditex increased its sales by 37% to €19.325 billion. Just a few days before the presentation of its results, the group announced the appointment of Óscar García Maceiras as CEO, effective immediately.  Marta Ortega, daughter of the group's founder, will take over as non-executive chairman of the board next April. Meanwhile, Pablo Isla will step down as chairman after a 15-year-long career at Inditex.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 2, 2022","The last few Men's Fashion Weeks proved fashion brands' ongoing difficulties of getting back on track to pre-pandemic days. Physical runway shows have partially returned but fashion brands continue to rely heavily on digital presentations. Several brands, such as Giorgio Armani, that had planned to return to the physical catwalk have abstained due to the resurgence of Covid cases. This uncertainty has led some fashion houses to change their plans altogether this season, as was the case with Versace.While the onslaught of women's fashion shows is scheduled to start soon, the Italian house, owned by the American Capri Holdings group, has just announced at the last minute that it will unveil its men's collection digitally this Wednesday, February 2 at 2 pm (CET) in the form of a video and not as an in-person runway show. The brand has chosen to stay in the sidelines for this season’s menswear weeks, which ended in Paris on January 23. Versace has also decided to forego a co-ed fashion show this year, an abrupt change to its strategy since as of February 2020, the brand’s menswear and womenswear collections were being presented together on the runway.    

The fashion house’s objective is to give greater visibility to its menswear collection, which have taken a back seat in recent years. Canadian born designers Dean and Dan Caten, owners of Dsquared2, have followed this same strategy as they have also given up mixed gender shows this year and have instead presented their menswear collection on the Milanese catwalks in January while its women's collection will be shown in February, as will Versace’s. Just a few weeks before the start of the Women’s Fashion Weeks, Tom Ford, who was supposed to close New York Fashion Week on February 16, had to cancel his show due to multiple cases of Covid in the brand’s studio and factories. The collection will not be ready for the scheduled date and will instead be presented digitally at a later date.
 
Other brands have preferred to postpone their show to another date outside the traditional fashion calendar in the hopes of finding a more serene health situation. Thom Browne, for instance, decided to abandon the February New York Fashion Week schedule and will instead hold a grand Fall/Winter 2022-23 co-ed runway show in the Big Apple on April 29, a few days before the Met Gala.
 
This coming spring will be especially busy, as many fashion houses felt inclined to schedule runway shows during this time period. On April 29, Emilio Pucci will unveil the first capsule collection of its new creative director, Camille Miceli, in Capri.
 
Gucci, which will showcase its men's and women's collection in Milan in February as per usual, has just announced that it will hold another co-ed fashion show in a yet unknown European destination on May 16, while Max Mara has scheduled its Cruise show for June 28 in Lisbon, Portugal.

"Feb 1, 2022","2022 will be Glenn Martens' year. The talented and innovative Belgian designer has been chosen to head the fashion jury of the Hyères Festival at the Villa Noialles, to be held from October 13 to 16. The creative director of Y/Project and Diesel, and who has just a few days ago presented a masterful Haute Couture collection for Jean Paul Gaultier in Paris, will take over the jury alongside Aska Yamashita and Pierre Debusschere.The artistic director of Atelier Montex, the embroidery workshop that joined the Métiers d'Art de Chanel in 2011, will chair the fashion accessories jury. The Belgian photographer, who has worked with the likes of Raf Simons and on certain Beyoncé videos, will head the photography jury.

The announcement was made on Friday evening, Jan. 28, at 19M, the new space put up by the fashion competition’s grand partner, Chanel, in Porte d'Aubervillier (in the 19th arrondissement of Paris). The founder and CEO of the event, Jean-Pierre Blanc, officially opened the 37th edition of the Hyères International Fashion and Photography Festival and announced the selected finalists, as well as the brand new ""L'atelier des matières"" award, in the fashion category.The other personalities and professionals from the industry who will participate in the juries were also announced.

"Feb 1, 2022","Stratospheric. This one word sums up the show presented this Friday, January 28 at the National Air and Space Museum, staged in tribute to the first anniversary of the death of French couturier, Pierre Cardin, and intended to present the new collection created by Rodrigo Basilicati Cardin along with his creative studio.The good old days of the fashion house’s physical fashion shows returned (we especially remember the brand’s 2018 presentation on the Great Wall of China). 850 guests, wearing mink coats and down jackets of all colors, from silver to daring pinks, braved the cold of Le Bourget to settle under huge tents at the foot of the Ariane 5 rocket.
 
The spectacle lasting 50 minutes presented continuous flashings of mesmerizing lights and sounds, and two giant screens projecting two retro videos detailing “space fashion” (aerial silhouetted loved by the founder) and the house’s signature “cosmocorps” style, which was invented at the end of the 1960s. The first part of the show presented Cardin’s last designs before his death, a retro-futuristic lineup featuring Star Trek inspired silhouettes, numerous capes, flying saucer skirts, and dresses in a pop color palette. The Cosmocorps 3022 collection that followed was described as “a continuation of Pierre Cardin’s work,” by Rodrigo Basilicati Cardin, nephew of the couturiere and heir to his empire. He added that it “required a year of hard work, and was made to represent with some evidence the Cardin style and touch.” In order to launch ""the new Cardin generation"", the creative studio relied on the same personalities that inspired Cardin himself for 30 years, such as Maryse Gaspard, creative director and former muse of Cardin. A series of images taken at the French Guiana space center, with the subjects pictured watching amazed by the flight of a rocket, were on display, symbolizing the rebirth of the house.

The 180 silhouettes included space warrior looks featuring XXL Pierre Cardin logos, 60s and 70s inspired retro dresses, a model wearing what resembled Peter Pan’s green coat, pop colors, purple and blue reflective lamé, glitter, superheroine capes in an elegant midnight blue, streamlined sunglasses, and bags in geometric shapes. The models looked as if they had just come out of the sci-fi TV series, V, as their outfits’ pointed collars and shoulders resembled the costumes seen on the show.  
 
The incredibly memorable finale presented a duo of space-alien models. The first wore a gold lamé suit under an indefinable helmet, and the other in a Teletubbies-styled dress, while the silhouette of a whirling dervish twirled to the sound of ethereal music, a remarkable performance before greeting the cosmonauts arriving from the Guiana space center. It had to be seen to be understood.During the final photocall, dinner guests such as Sylvana Lorenz (a close friend of Pierre Cardin) took center stage, and Rodrigo Basilicati Cardin praised the teamwork involved in organizing this monumental show, ""the most difficult thing in the end, was not to present the creative heritage of Pierre Cardin, but the way we wanted to ensure the continuation of the company. Pierre wanted me to continue his brand, and the family supported me. With delicacy and progression, the transition went well.""
 
The Pierre Cardin brand, which is present in 170 countries, should now undergo a creative refocus around its many licenses moving forward. ""Over the past 20 years, the development of licenses has been uncontrollable,"" concluded Rodrigo Basilicati Cardin.""It is up to us to regain control of this by being more present and redefining the direction of the brand’s design, each piece must embody the Cardin style,"" he pointed out.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 31, 2022","Emilio Pucci will soon relaunch and unveil its new image. The luxury house, of which LVMH has been majority owner since June 2021 (the group has controlled 67% of the shares since 2000), is preparing to unveil the first capsule collection designed by Camille Miceli, who was appointed creative director last September.

The presentation will take place on April 29 in Capri, Italy, as the label announced in a brief statement, adding that the designer was hired ""with the intention of starting a new chapter in the history of the maison.""No details have been revealed about the event, but the little that is known suggests that it will take the form of a cruise fashion show. The choice of Capri as the location seems consistent with the brand’s new strategy implemented by LVMH and is also directly linked to the brand’s origins. The first store, which Emilio Pucci opened in 1951 on the island, was followed by its golden age the following decade, dressing the most celebrated personalities that passed through the Italian jet-set destination, from Marilyn Monroe to Jackie Kennedy.
 
""The idea is to give the house a more resort-focused orientation, because we believe that's where its strength lies,"" said LVMH CEO Antonio Belloni last November during the ""Show Me"" event organized in Florence to promote the brand’s excellence. ""If the product and the brand are well positioned and attractive, then the business works. We are very focused on finding a creative proposition for the brand and a space where it can find success with customers, all of course with management appropriate to its size.""On the same occasion, Camille Miceli spoke publicly for the first time: ""Emilio Pucci is for me the house of joy, prints and lifestyle. The brand represents all the beauty of Italy. The challenge will be to make perfect garments with a touch of imperfection, because imperfection gives meaning to know-how,"" she explained, stressing the importance of ""the talent of our creatives, without whom nothing would be possible.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 28, 2022","Stella McCartney has created a new look for Walt Disney’s Minnie Mouse as Disneyland Paris marks its 30th anniversary. For the celebration, she’ll be seen in a blue pantsuit to replace her red polkadot dress, although her traditional bow remains a key part of the look.The new look will debut in March, in time for Women’s History Month, with McCartney saying the new take on the signature polka dots “makes Minnie Mouse a symbol of progress for a new generation”.

The makeover has drawn mixed reviews online with some hailing it as a positive move but one conservative US commentator on Fox News accusing those responsible for the new look of attempting to “destroy the fabric of our society”.Minnie Mouse, a character who was introduced almost 100 years ago, will also feature on a Stella McCartney T-shirt as part of the events around International Women’s Day.

"Jan 28, 2022","Paris couture remains a powerful magnate for experimental designers, as the final day witnessed collections from Yuima Nakazato of Japan, Imane Ayissi of Cameroon and Aelis of Italy.YUIMA NAKAZATO: Elfin couture in a spiritual setting 
Got to hand it to Yuima Nakazato, he marches to his own beat. The only Japanese couturier to present a collection this season in Paris, Yuima unveiled a meditative mode staged with grace inside the Oratoire du Louvre, the most famous Protestant church in Paris.
 
Dry ice engulfed the portal of the church as two skilled dancers – dressed as pale gray spirits - pirouetted to announce the beginning of the action.The show contained elements of ready-wear and couture, and Nakazato began with the former; black pantsuits, though made with capes and trimmed with fiery orange or violet, matching the models’ hair color.
 
Before Yuima changed two gears, sending out tie-dyed chiffon spirits and harpies, feathers sprouting occasionally, their hair completed with elf’s ears. All wafting along the stone floor, before an audience perched in the church’s wooden choir seats.
 
Though the Tokyo-based creator’s biggest idea was his puckered skill fantasies, as if appearing from the nether regions of a samurai movie by Masaki Kobayashi. 
 IMANE AYISSI: Foufoullou couture 
Cameroon have been winning form this month as they host the African Cup of Nations. In Paris, one of its sons - couturier Imane Ayissi - won a major distinction too, right after staging an elegant and expressive couture show.
 
This was followed by the award of the Chevalier de l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres, one of France’s most prestigious distinctions, pinned on Ayissi’s lapel by Pascal Morand, Executive President of the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French high fashion’s governing body.
 
“Imane has been a model, a boxer, dancer and now a couturier… Though in fashion he has explored the body and the soul. And in his latest career has created many marvels,” said Morand. 
 
In a moving speech Ayissi thanked family, atelier, the Federation, and the house of Yves Saint Laurent for sponsoring his entrance onto the official couture show calendar.
 
“Couture has not always been easy, but thanks to help of so many generous people and their belief in creativity, we have managed to create our own idea of couture,” said a tearful Ayissi. 
 
An astute and elegant use of bright colors that YSL would have admired – blending fuchsia, chartreuse and a great pebbled marble print – and a harmonious sense of proportion made for a very fine show. Add to that Imane’s artful blending of African influences like raw raffia with sustainable fabrics – he even made two looks out of Chinese bamboo fibers - in a couture first.
 
Entitled Foufoullou, meaning 'mixed' or 'together' in the Cameroonian language of Ewondo, Ayissi also covered many looks with printed words calling for greater support for ecology.
 
Presented in a small art gallery before a select group of editors, and former French culture minister Audrey Azoulay, the show captured all of Ayissi’s originality. Plus, Imane’s reputation meant hundreds of fans pressed up against the windows to see the action, by the first sub-Saharan couturier to show in Paris. Ayissi fully merits that respect.
 
 AELIS: Tuscan couture in the Park Hyatt 
Sofia Crociani’s Aelis might be a small independent house but she sure can make a big statement fashion video.
 
Entitled Nirvana, and shot in a Left Bank hotel particulier, it captured her sense of fluid draping, elaborate use of bows and evocative imagery. The cast almost magically appearing and disappearing in the grand mansion, and past a monumental art work by Olafur Eliasson.
 
With the pandemic never ending, Crociani also held a showroom and private appointments in the Park Hyatt, the better to display her ideas, and let visitors appreciate her noble fabrics.
 
“The future is so difficult to predict due to Covid. So, I wanted to start with my own memories of jeans, of lace, of films. And from that came the search for Nirvana,” explained the Tuscan couturier, who hails from the historic hilltop town of Montepulciano.

"Jan 27, 2022","While there seems to be no end in sight for the pandemic, fashion designers have put all their efforts into creating versatile menswear collections for the Fall/Winter 2022-23 that are both sophisticated and laid-back, and above all deeply rejuvenated, as illustrated by the menswear show marathon in Milan and Paris that ended on Sunday January 23. Lockdown-inspired cocooning is a thing of the past, replaced by the discernible return of a genuine yearning for fashion. An evolution that is taking place softly, via well-balanced collections ushering in a cosy new urban elegance, whose silhouettes are redefined by means of innovative proportions, cuts and textures, while great emphasis is placed on outerwear, the new flagship items in men’s wardrobes.1- The suit, revisited

Tracksuits and pyjamas are out! For next winter, suits have pride of place again. They are precision-engineered and come in all sorts of materials, from silk to velvet, denim, tweed, flannel, wool and even, as at Bianca Saunders, in biker-style leather. Double-breasted blazers are back in a variety of styles. Jackets and sleeves have lengthened, and burgeon with new volumes, especially at the shoulders. The lines are cinched at the waist and often padded to create imposing shoulders, or else entirely destructured, while some jackets sport innovative rounded shapes. Trousers too feature inventive solutions in terms of fastenings, creases and darts, as well as in their cuts, for example with arched legs.2- Skirt suits 

Tunic dresses and maxi skirts have ben making frequent appearances in menswear collections for a number of seasons, and are no longer taboo. The same goes for jewellery, which has become a must-have accessory for any man’s everyday look. A lengthy journey towards a complete absence of gender differentiation, whose only missing steps were the wedding dress and the skirt suit. This season, the journey has been completed.

A wedding dress cropped up in the last collection designed by Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton, while skirt suits have been showcased by a few daring labels. Dolce & Gabbana did it with a classic houndstooth suit, Moschino with a blazer matched with a pleated turquoise mini-skirt, JordanLuca with a suit in golden yellow wool, consisting of a long double-breasted blazer and a kilt. While EgonLab and Miguel Vieira provided their own variation on the theme by adding to a traditional suit a pleated skirt made in the same fabric, layered over the trousers. 
3- Joggers breakthrough 

Joggers are the new gold standard in trousers. They have jettisoned the strictly snug, slouching-in-the-lounge register of old, to morph into an uber-chic, essential menswear item, worn in suits with matching jackets. Often with a practical drawstring fastening, they acquire new status especially with a straight-leg cut and a crease at the front. Whether stretching down to the ground, tapered or cinched at the ankle, joggers lend themselves to countless variations. They are slashed at Sankuanz, corkscrew-cut at Y/Project, ultra-classy in ochre-coloured knit at Rhude or made of sublime cashmere at Brioni. 
4- Yeti looks 

Fur, which is gradually being banned by most labels, has never appeared so frequently on the runways as this season, made with new types of material. It featured notably in ample fur collars and lapels, and even in muffs worn mid-arm. Fur coats, and especially shaggy jackets, often in pop hues like sky blue as at Dries Van Noten, have carved a space for themselves in next winter’s wardrobes. Of course, with matching furry boots, for a proper yeti look.5- Shearling jackets

Outerwear is very much centre stage next season. Alongside fur jackets, a number of traditional outdoor garments were the genuine highlights of post-pandemic menswear collections. Like aviator jackets, a classic that comes in all shapes and sizes, like colourful extra-large down jackets and three-quarter length parkas. Above all, shearling and bouclé wool jackets were ubiquitous, sometimes reinterpreted and destructured as at Y/Project, or entirely transformed as at Jonathan Anderson, both for Loewe and for his own label's collection, while Hermès showcased jackets with blue fur lining.
  
6- The throw

Protection is an enduring theme. It is apparent chiefly in the layering of multi-collar clothes and jackets, in the hybridisation of fabrics, and notably in the number of throws and stoles latched on to garments. Blankets are leaving the bedroom and going out into the fresh air.

Whether striped or in signature tartan checks, they are worn like a longline tunic at Rick Owens, and turn into multi-layer capes/ponchos at Dsquared2 and White Mountaineering. Tasselled plaids become hooded coats at Kenzo, while Bluemarble uses traditional satin-trimmed bedspreads to stitch together its coats.7- Quilted down garments

Quilted down garments are still going strong and are to be found in most of next winter's collections, beyond the classic down jackets and overcoats. They feature as hoods/head coverings and gigantic blanket-like scarves, almost like sleeping bags enveloping the body, neck and head (at Justin Gall, Hed Mayner, Y/Project, Rains and Dsquared2).

In many instances, they are worn as life-jacket-style gilets or bullet-proof vests, looking very much like futuristic armour (at Rick Owens and A-Cold-Wall). Not to mention the bulky Michelin Man-style skiing trousers by Dolce & Gabbana, EgonLab and Spyder, some of the labels pandering to the winter sport trend. 
8- Hoods

Face masks for Covid protection have made an impact, and will feature in people's minds for some time. On the runways, this translated into a systematic covering of faces, notably with hoods, which are becoming next winter's signature accessory. Paul Smith presented them in its traditional thin stripes, Sulvam in houndstooth fabric. They were heart-shaped at Loewe, and at Louis Vuitton they were matched with suits, decorated with the maison’s renowned monogram. In the guise of Lycra balaclavas or vintage pilot helmets, they assumed an almost criminal allure, zipped and with only two slits for the eyes, as at Sankuanz, Rick Owens and Walter Van Beirendonck.  

In general, hats and head coverings have become key items for defining the new men's looks.  They are omni-present, from berets to Peruvian-style bonnets to felt and ten-gallon hats.9- Thigh-high boots

This season, men are appropriating another symbol of femininity, an accessory that in the distant past used to be a menswear staple: thigh-high boots. GmbH presented various models in different types of leather. At Rick Owens, they were platform-soled. Sean Suen featured them as black fairy-tale boots. Acne Studios and Louis Vuitton both presented thigh-high boots, while at Moschino they took the form of colourful, detachable leather gaiters rising up to mid-thigh.10- Strapped shoes

This season, designers put a great deal of effort into creating original shoes, like Dior’s grey embroidered felt clogs made in collaboration with Birkenstock, which are set to become a best-seller. Also, they explored the possibilities of strapped shoes, inspired by traditional Mary Jane women's shoes, which may well earn themselves a slot in men’s wardrobes. Fendi presented a luxe version with watch-equipped straps. Grace Wales Bonner opted for a sportier model with a broad strap, and Hed Mayner featured them as flat ballerinas.

"Jan 27, 2022","Next month will see the launch of The Frntal, a UK-based online retailer that’s also a platform for “representing and showcasing emerging creatives and pioneers in contemporary fashion and design"". It's also a marketplace for ""selling their physical items and trading their non-fungible tokens”.It will “offer its members an international cloud solution for creative needs, and a tailored programme to equip designers with the tools they need today”, we’re told.

The company says it’s partnering with brands to offer connected services across retail, marketing, PR and communications, celebrities and talents collaborations, and partnerships.That means it’s not only an online retailer, but also helps brands to “increase their press by providing them with simple tools to connect with top media online any time, and be seen by buyers and retailers, without pitching to a single one”.

It said there’s a need for this as “young, aspiring designers face enormous hurdles at the beginning of their careers”. So the Frntal aims to offer “access to services that can propel their businesses forward on terms they can afford rather than large and unnecessary PR and sales activations”.

Housing all PR content in an online press room also allows journalists, editors, and stylists “to access everything they need to feature a brand in an instant and, as a result, increases their press coverage results significantly and connect with a global audience of buyers and retailers”.

As for the NFT inclusion in the offer, the company said: “We are building the ultimate online destination for the fashion and design physical and NFT universe. We believe in blockchain technology as an enabler for a more democratic, connected, and valuable way of creating digital fashion experiences. NFTs are the starting point of a fashion experience that you can own, in which we can create new ways to experience and relate to fashion”.

It sees its NFT marketplace becoming not only a tool to sell virtual garments, but also a “platform to provide valuable data about garments, designs, and trends, by virtualising every garment and enabling users to personally wear and experience the digital fashion item”.

And as some people question the point of fashion’s current obsession with NFTs, it added that an NFT can make virtual fashion items as unique as tangible products, “solving the problem of the reproducibility of digital clothing. With NFT, the catalogue of unique products widens. A fashion brand could sell their own show video or individual backstage photos as NFT. In the case of digital copies, the NFT makes it possible to trace the original copy that could be purchased by a collector”. 

And it feels that NFTs “could have an impact on the resale market, not only by keeping an accurate map of changes in ownership of a certain item but also, for example, by providing brands with a royalty every time their product is sold in the second-hand luxury market”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 27, 2022","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) announced this week the launch of a new interim membership tier, along with its inaugural 22 interim members. The new tier was created to serve as a pipeline to full CFDA membership and specifically to support designers who have been in business for one to five years, and who have achieved a noteworthy level of recognition and success. 

As part of the new tier, interim members are invited by the CFDA to join the organization for a limited time of up to three years.Interim members enjoy most of the same benefits as a full CFDA membership like joining membership meetings, but have no voting rights and cannot serve on the CFDA Board. They will also have the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive business development guidance and support, plus individual mentoring and industry introductions, as needed.

To further create opportunities for emerging designers across America, interim membership dues are waived for the first year, and will be significantly reduced for years two and three.

“There is a vast pool of young talent that is contributing to the creative conversation in American fashion,” said Steven Kolb, CEO of the CFDA. 

“Often, these designers are underrepresented  and underfunded, and they are challenged to fulfill their brands’ potential because they lack institutional support. By opening CFDA’s resources and network to the interim members, we are embracing this creative class and advancing their opportunity for success.”

The first designers invited to the inaugural interim membership tier include a class of 22 designers: Nicole Benefield, Kim Bentz, Melissa Bentz, Aisling Camps, Patrick Cupid, Patrick Henry, Emma Gage, Snow Xue Gao, Lauren Harwell Godfrey, Raul Lopez, Bach Mai, Keeyahri, Sami Miro, Nicole Muhammad, Christian Juul Nielson, Shawn Pean, Teddy Von Ranson, T.A.

"Jan 26, 2022","After emancipating itself from the official Fashion Week calendar these past few seasons, the renowned Italian fashion house owned by the Kering group announced in November its intentions to return this upcoming February to Milan Fashion Week, which it had abandoned for two years. The co-ed show will then be followed by another show just three months later. “Gucci is pleased to announce that creative director Alessandro Michele will present a co-ed collection on May 16, 2022, to be presented in Europe. The location and name of the collection will be revealed shortly,” the brand said briefly without providing further details.

At the beginning of the pandemic, Michele had felt the need to abandon the traditional seasonal calendar and reduce the number of his collections in order to focus more on the creativity of the brand. In 2020, Michele unveiled his collection in the form of a video in July followed by another in November composed of several short films. In 2021, the collection dubbed “Aria” was delivered virtually in April. Gucci's latest November fashion show in Los Angeles saw the brand's long-awaited return to the catwalk.  Gucci seems to want to accelerate its pace this 2022, since following its February and May shows, the brand will present yet another collection in September, as indicated by Gucci’s CEO Marco Bizzarri at the end of 2021. 

The fashion house, which saw its sales slow down significantly in the third quarter, refuses to participate in the signature spring Cruise shows this year. With the two shows in February and September along with its new show in May, the brand’s new schedule looks very similar to what it did before the pandemic.

"Jan 26, 2022","The menswear brand, founded by Naomi Gunther in January 2019, is undoubtedly the emerging French brand to look out for among the luxury streetwear market. The brand, presented alongside 30 other international brands at the Tranoï fashion tradeshow, hosted a fashion show for Paris Fashion Week outside of the official fashion season calendar on Jan. 17 at the La Scala theater. Gunther shocked the press as she presented the first physical fashion show of the season ahead of the official Paris Fashion Week schedule. Familiar faces in street culture and curious by-passers alike crowded the entrance of the La Scala theater on the Boulevard de Strasbourg in the 10th arrondissement of Paris. The Parsons School of Design graduate welcomed her guests with fictitious newspapers, with the words “Dear New York” plastered on the front page. The newspapers served as a means of immediately revealing the title and inspiration behind the Fall/Winter 2022 collection; a tribute to the city that never sleeps.
 
“I am originally Parisian, but New York is the city I carry with me in my heart. I studied there for three years and that is where I discovered streetwear. It is also a city that is very rich in terms of proposing and mixing many different styles,” explained the designer to FashionNetwork.com as she spoke about the French and American cultures that influenced her latest collection.Modern and comfortable silhouettes, wide sweatshirts, casual T-shirts, and baggy sweatpants make up the wardrobe designed for the urban man. The color palettes of New York City were displayed throughout the collection; the city’s yellow cabs, the greenery of Central Park, and the orange and purple blinding lights of Broadway.
 “Made in France” meets New York City 
“I wanted to divide the collection into three categories. The first category is from a tourist’s perspective of New York, featuring souvenir logos, caps, and jewelry. The second category is a tribute to the city’s streetwear marked by Virgil Abloh, who inspired me a lot as a designer. The final category is a Parisian aesthetic defined by structured tailoring, volumes, and the research behind each fabric,” continued the designer as she spoke about the collection inspired by various elements of American culture. 

The teddy and bomber jackets referenced American prep-school uniforms while a long mobster-inspired coat could have well been worn by Al Capone himself. Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz, both New York City natives, tied the runway show's theme together as the models walked to the beat of their songs.The collection’s accessories include caps made from 100% organic cotton, available for purchase on the brand’s website for the price of €95, and an array of XXL logo-printed knitted scarves. “They are very important for our brand. We always try to include a hand-knitted piece in our collections to highlight the French and traditional ‘savoir-faire’,” said Gunther. 
 
In line with its ethical practices, the brand designs and manufactures its pieces in Paris, collaborates with local artisans, and promotes the use of recycled and organic fabrics such as bamboo or recycled woods and plastics. The brand produces its products based on its current demand in order to avoid overproducing and only uses already available fabrics.

“Our ambition is to offer unique quality pieces at the fairest possible price points,” explained the brand, with a price positioning between €100 and €1,000. Gunther's products are available for purchase at the Printemps retail and online stores, e-commerce shops Zalando and Not Just a Label, and in the B Hype boutique in Dubai.
 
The fashion show left the audience surprised by the unexpected model who walked down the runway. The French soccer player, Djibril Cissé, known for playing for the Liverpool and Olympique de Marseille soccer clubs, strutted down the catwalk wearing a long, purple, wide lapel wool-blend coat. Cissé and Gunther met through Instagram as the soccer star fell in love with the brand after wearing Gunther's designs for a photo shoot.

“He is a fashion icon and we thought it’d be a great idea for him to join us on the catwalk,” said the designer, who counts rappers Hatik, SCH, and Soolking as one of her brand's many loyal fans.

"Jan 25, 2022","Max Mara is taking its next resort show on the road again, as the Italian marque reveals plans to stage its next cruise collection in Lisbon.
 
""Max Mara is pleased to announce that the Max Mara Resort 2023 collection will be shown in Lisbon, Portugal on Tuesday, June 28, 2022,” the house announced late Monday. 
The jaunt to Portugal will come one year after Max Mara presented its 2022 resort collection on Ischia, the verdant Isola Verde just west of Naples. Staged in the retrained opulence of the Mezzatorre Hotel, that collection referenced the famed 'Swans' of Truman Capote, the American writer who wrote lovingly of Ischia after spending several months there in 1950s.  
 
Foreign trips have become something of signature for Max Mara, which has also stage prestige catwalk events in Berlin and New York.Due to Covid, the house was unable to stage a planned show last summer in St Petersburg. 
 
The house has also been savvy enough to organize its shows in historic locations: in Berlin within the Neues Museum on Museum Island; and in New York at the then newly opened Whitney Museum, where it even launched a Whitney bag as part of that project.
 
Let’s see what emerges from the voyage to the hilly coastal capital of Portugal, located where the Tagus river meets the Atlantic Ocean.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2022","The Paris menswear season hadn’t quite ended, and the haute couture season has not begun. Nonetheless, the city witnessed two striking women’s ready-to-wear shows by the houses of Paco Rabanne and Alaïa on Sunday evening.
 AlaïaThey say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Well, there was an entire audience of beholders chez Alaïa to witness a truly magnificent show by Pieter Mulier in his second collection for the house. 
 
For his debut in July, Mulier respectfully interpreted many of Alaïa’s key codes. This time, he bravely created a stunning, sexy and sumptuous Fall/Winter collection 2002, that was an avowed hit.Where his ability to flatter and enhance the figure, rendered so many of the cast into modern day goddesses. Few designers had a better eye for a great model than Azzedine, and that tradition continues with Pieter, who assembled a brilliant cast of young and mature stars.
 
There was a keen sense of expectancy before the show had even begun, as the likes of Naomi Campbell and Kim Jones took their places in the front row of a show staged under the glass verrière Alaïa’s Rue de Moussy headquarters in the Marais and outside in its courtyard.Mulier opened with valkyries and amazons in one-shoulder leotards with one-leg mega flared pants; white stretch lace flamenco dresses; and uber-high collared men’s shirts paired with denim flamenco pants.
 
He enveloped the torso in perfectly judged volume, patent leather cocoon coats in soft pink and crinkly black.

Though the most fabulous was a double-breasted general’s coat in midnight blue, worn by veteran super, Elise Crombez. Too much recent volume in fashion has been freakish, this was just fabulous.
 
“I think of Azzedine as the father figure of this place. And I also think of my mother. With this collection I wanted to mix our heritage, our stories. Dialogue with the past. The inspirations. The arts. Write the future together. Create and experiment. Follow a quest. Of beauty and fashion. Nothing more,” Mulier explained, in a program letter to guests.
 
Even when he lifted ideas directly from Azzedine, like the stretch lace cocktails, Peter added his own tough sexy twists, like adding giant leather thigh boots or matelassé leather corsets.
 
Before a truly stunning quintet of v-line dresses, hand-embroidered in metaphysical sketches that reached all the way to collars that covered the mouth, in a visual play on Covid masks. Nor was he afraid to inject a little humor, like shaggy yeti shearling thigh-boots. All very commercial too, with peg-leg denim jeans that grew into black midriffs; or sensational black nylon femme fatale flight jackets.
 
All told, an unequivocal success. No wonder we discovered CEO Myriam Serrano and Philippe Fortunato, president of the fashion division of luxury conglomerate Richemont, which owns Alaïa, in such ebullient mood pre-show.
 
Even with masks on, they looked like they were smiling - like cats in front of huge bowls of milk. 
 Paco RabanneThis Paco Rabanne collection was perhaps easier to write about than to wear, but somehow It was still a great stylistic statement.
 
Paco Rabanne’s designer Julien Dossena is certainly imbued with oodles of talent, and boasts a highly fertile imagination. He combines eras and materials with great skill and audacity to make dramatic clothes that scream French high-fashion with every look.Take two of his opening looks: a brilliant draped, speckled creped jacket buttoned at the top, which zippered open below the waist to reveal a frou-frou skirt; or an audacious school-marm’, anthracite top with lace collar, which morphed into a figure-hugging jumpsuit with a middle gray panel.
 
Followed by perfectly proportioned silk jackets and fracks paired with plissé miniskirts; wool bouclé coat dresses; and ruffled tops with billowing bloomers. Everything cut way up the thigh, and then some.
 
Presented to an audience of some 160 guests, with social distancing carefully enforced, the show was artfully staged. Turning a soaring ceiling wing of the modernist Palais de Tokyo into long narrow, mauve tunnel with an illuminated ceiling. Though as the lighting barely changed when the models appeared one witnessed most of the show in a murky scarlet or violet half-light. Oddly inefficient.
 
On each place sat one of nine new scents by the house: a series named 'PacCollection', each ending with Me, with names like Major, Blossom and Dandy. 
 
“PacCollection fragrances translate a sense of liberated individualism,” commented Dossena in his brief program note. Which could have summed these clothes: liberated to the maximum. 
 
Dossena took his bow to loud applause. One could not fault his audacity and pluck. But he is certainly not a master merchandiser. One needs the body of a lithe, young model to make these clothes work, but given their price range the target market is two decades older.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2022","The Ouest Paris Fall/Winter 2022 collection of this menswear season was presented at the Tranoï trade show, hosted in Le Carreau du Temple located in the heart of Paris on Thursday, Jan. 20. Arthur Robert unveiled his first collection a few steps away from Virgil Abloh’s final runway collection for Louis Vuitton, honoring the creative director’s memory following his passing on Nov. 28.  

 Arthur Robert, founder of the French label, successfully underwent this first and challenging step of debuting his brand, rushing to receive the down jackets for his looks that same morning. The collection is composed of more than 80 pieces, despite the short day allowing him to exhibit only half a dozen of his silhouettes against a backdrop depicting the wide-open spaces of an American landscape.


“I came up with the brand and the collection during the Covid pandemic lockdowns. I would be scrolling through Google Maps to entertain myself, the idea of escaping elsewhere ever-present. The name is a mix between the Southwest coast of France, where I’m originally from, and my fascination for American culture and the Wild West. By merging the surfing culture of Southwestern France and the West Coast with the Wild West, I was able to combine all my sources of inspiration and create Ouest Paris,” explains the designer who previously worked for Maison Kitsuné and AMI. Alexandre Mattuissi, founder of the latter, came upon the independent work of his former employee this Wednesday.Robert chose to veer away from his past work with AMI by taking Ouest Paris in a completely different creative direction. The brand’s logo found plastered upon the collection’s products draws inspiration from elements of surf wear, such as the details found on a wetsuit’s zipper and the materials and shapes of a protective surfboard cover. The use of raw, sturdy denim made from organic cotton throughout the collection references the original utilitarian fabric’s origins and traditional workwear influences.

 Robert Arthur’s first collection, produced in Portugal and Eastern Europe, includes T-shirts under €100, marine striped sweaters, fleece sweatshirts, tracksuits, shirts, jackets, down jackets, jeans under €300, as well as a wide variety of hats and caps.  

This collection hopes to garner the attention of multi-brand retail stores as the French brand aims to target a niche premium market mainly occupied by American and Asian brands. Ouest Paris plans on activating its online store by this summer and will be present at the Tranoï trade show in the Palais de Tokyo from this Friday until Jan. 23.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2022","This Paris menswear season’s big debut was by Nigo at Kenzo on Sunday morning, and the Japanese cult designer’s first collection for the Japanese-born house was certainly made with finesse and a floral flourish.
 
Flowers at the heart of this brand, most memorably in the popular mind with Kenzo Flower, whose signature carnation appeared throughout this show. 
Staged just down the street from Kenzo headquarters, inside Paris prettiest passage, the 199-year-old Galerie Vivienne, the show attracted a large mob of fashion fans and Instagram freaks. Who went into an overdrive when Kanye West and Nigo’s design partner Pharrell Williams arrived, even if by now the pair seem like LVMH rent-a-rappers, seeing as they attend so many of the conglomerate’s shows.
 
A further feeding frenzy occurred inside the gallery, as paparazzi scrambled for shots of the celebs, and security staff fought to clear the runway. In a generous gesture, Nigo provided all guests with a new red-and-white logo blanket, which most people needed. Despite the bitter cold, and even wearing a PPF8 mask, one could still discern the sweet smell of ganja as the audience calmed down and the first looks appeared.Nigo smartly played on all the classic themes of Kenzo. Kicking off with fab plaid blanket coats for girls and guys in a co-ed show. Before showing scores of florals; from naive print denim and scarves; funky blue carnation bovver boots; and utterly charming silk gilets for cool, young ladies.
 
Best of all he captured the way the founder managed to incorporate Japanese sensibility with Parisian style, like pinning faux military medals on multiple medals. The city’s most charming military medal store just happens to be 100 yards away in Palais Royale.
 
The playful tradition of Kenzo Takada was also maintained in series of cool stencil prints of fashion sketches, and all manner of great berets, from golfer to grand artist, to dandy military.Nigo joined Kenzo with a sterling reputation, thanks to his insider urban marque A Bathing Ape. He has also made collab’ collections with Fendi and Louis Vuitton, flagship LVMH brands. It was Nigo who introduced Virgil Abloh to Michael Burke, leading to Abloh’s eventual appointment at Vuitton. And, in effect, Nigo was the first DJ to launch a credible fashion marque, and thus the precursor of a whole movement.
 
Nigo’s predecessors at Kenzo had been criticized for reducing it to a tiger print brand, the big cat was so ubiquitous on sweatshirts. But the new designer at least took the tiger somewhere new with couture-like baseball jackets and chunky après-ski sweaters.
 
The house of Kenzo was once reputed for its tailoring, a tradition lost in the past decade. So, it was admirable to see Nigo send out natty Prince of Wales, plaid and chalk-stripe suits. That said, quite why he then hid most of them under mini kimonos was fairly dumb. Moreover, a whole series of bulbous padded parka – an appalling trend on many catwalks this season -  were an aesthetic-rights offence.
 
That said, this was a powerful first display from Nigo, who riffed on the DNA even as he added his own DJ twist. Perhaps not a home run, but a great start nonetheless.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 23, 2022","All about breaking boundaries this Saturday in Paris in the menswear season; between clothes and accessories at Loewe; weekend and work chez Hermès; mountains and club at Vuarnet.
 Loewe - Light unto the worldA good quarter of the looks in the latest menswear show of Loewe were illuminated from the inside, in the latest collection for the house by Jonathan Anderson, the freshest visionary in men’s fashion today. 
Bands of bright white LEDs trimmed waistbands; peeked out of blazers; studded jumpsuits or decorated sweaters; and wandered in crazy patterns over flesh color tops made of hosiery.
 
“The idea of the light unto the world. Since we all lived in this illuminated existence. Something sort of spiritual,” explained Anderson after the show, staged in a giant in-door tennis court on the western outskirts of Paris.Practically every look contained something unexpected – like the Flamenco bag that suddenly became a pair of hushpuppy style boots, or the woollen gloves, whose fingers grew to be tentacles scraping the floor.
 
“Breaking down boundaries; between clothes and accessories; androgyny; and having no limits,” commented the Northern Irish designer.
 
Presented amid a series of giant ribbons hung from slanted aluminum masks, like torn up flags, with the entire floor space covered in sand. Nothing was quite what it seemed, including a trio of rubber coats in day-glow colors that looked made of see-through rubber. These turned out to semi-transparent leather, almost glowing and featuring underwear visible beneath.
 
Warming to his boundary-free terrain, Anderson also sent out some top coats, intertwined with denim shorts and belts, for clever trompe l’oeil and zany tailing.
 
His other big idea – coats and tops grommeted with sink strainers. 
 
“Well, we wake up every day with them. The first thing in the morning you stand over them in a shower! Plus, I like the idea of things not being too normal,” laughed Anderson, wearing a mask as he spoke to a score of editors.
 Vuarnet - Active sports cool in the AlpsVuarnet, the iconic French sunglass marque, has returned to fashion with some style, and sass and credible sustainability, helmed by Boramy Viguier. A designer known for his out-there shows and videos – one season presenting inside the Bourse de Paris, another doing Disney-meets -Game of Thrones warrior mashup videos. 
But at Vuarnet, he concentrated on active sportswear – jumpsuits, boiler-suits, ski jackets, and race pants – though mingled in with some winter clubbing clobber.
 
Mostly made in black and white and profiting from Viguier’s graphic confidence and keen eye for the telling detail. The designer finished most looks with the famous V on a ski logo stenciled into every Vuarnet shades. They all look strong and credible, and made mostly in recycled materials.
 
“It’s about enjoying the grandeur of the mountains. An almost spiritual feeling and bringing something of that mood into the collection,” opined Viguier, 
 
Vuarnet has been on an upward trajectory since being acquired by NEO Investment Partners. Vuarnet has also been a pioneer in sustainability since the company was born back in 1957. Named after the Los Angeles gold winning downhill champion Jean Vuarnet, the marque boasts natural designs that are 100% recyclable, a quality not frequently seen in eyewear, nor until recently in fashion.

All unveiled in the new, happening Dover Street Market in the Marais. A giant screen for the show video: retro spy thriller armchairs; Alpine school desks with candles; a great range of racy skier shades; funky cool ski gloves; and, in a generous touch, vials of Génépi, the French liqueur that has warmed many a skier on the final run of the day.
 
So a strong return to la mode by Vuarnet, helmed with exuberance by Boramy, trumpeted by a marvelous collection video shot in the Alpine fastness near Chambèry.
 
“I will be honest and say I was surprised they chose me. But they let me follow my visions. And the check cleared. Just joking!” laughed the enthusiastic Boramy.
 Hermès - Street-fighting man chicYou know that the short triangle-shaped pant has won the trouser wars when a brand like Hermès sends out scores of them in its latest menswear show.All the new pants cut with two-inch-plus turn-ups and paired with hefty boots – many in metallic-hued coopers and silver, whether Chelsea, pony or bovver boots. Street-fighting man chic.
 
A radical step for Hermès, and for its menswear designer Véronique Nichanian, who is always at her best when she takes a few risks. 
 
Véronique also introduced a new Kelly man bag, a deeper version with attached side pockets. A trick she used in shearling tops and nylon sci-fi blouses. In a stylish presentation in the Mobilier National, done up with classical tapestries, hung beside virtual copies of the same tapestries shown on massive flat screens.  
 
Working proportions smartly, Nichanian cut some great weekend jerkins in mustard calfskin, taiga green leather; black porosus crocodile. While her two-tone shearlings with contrasting hued interiors will spark a major trend
 
And all her Canadians, the French term for a four-pocket winter trapper coat, came with just the right amount of oversize, and shaggy lapels. Injecting some posh rock hipster glamour.
 
There was the odd redundant puffer – never a Hermès strength – and an odd padded trench, but overall this was a collection of highly coveted men clothes, by the classiest house in Paris from the designer still brave enough to exit her comfort zone after three decades in her job.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 22, 2022","Paris haute couture, the pinnacle of fashion, begins its next four-day runway season on Monday morning, and despite the pandemic, there will be no shortage of live shows.
 
All told, at the time of writing, there will be 16 live runway shows. Another seven houses will stage physical and video presentations with rendezvous on an appointment basis for editors and clients; and a further six will be purely digital displays.  
“Everyone loves to show. That’s never been clearer. There is nothing to compare between a physical show and a digital event. That is crystal clear to everyone, especially to couturiers,” explained Ralph Toledano, president of the Federation of Haute Couture et de la Mode, which controls all runway seasons in Paris.
 
“You know, this season plenty of young designers are approaching the Federation. We have a lot of demands for places on our calendar. We are in a period where a lot of people want to innovate and try new ways of working, and haute couture is the ideal field. So there is a long-term movement into couture. Couture is first of all a laboratory, so the ideal discipline,” explains Toledano.That said, entrance onto the couture calendar is up there with passing through the eye of the needle. This season, the Federation only accepted one new entrance on the official schedule - Yanina, which will round off the season with a show on Thursday evening in the Russia embassy. 
 
“Being on the calendar of Paris haute couture is meaningful, so we take responsibility in not listing just anyone. So, the houses accepted have a duty as well, to produce great fashion,” stressed Toledano. 
 
Due to the pandemic, recent ready-to-wear seasons have seen shows radically reduced in size, with social distancing strictly enforced; buyer numbers limited and Asian editors and retailers largely absent. However, couture’s clientele is a rarefied strata of billionaire’s wives and rich princesses, so expect to see a flotilla of limousines outside major shows this coming week.
 
And even if fewer clients travel to Paris, major houses travel their collections and thanks to the internet, all clients see the product. Moreover, Hollywood stars are traditionally absent in January – too busy with award season in America.
 
The two single most prestigious French couture houses, Christian Dior and Chanel, will both stage two shows: Dior in the Rodin Museum and Chanel in its preferred location, the Grand Palais.Moreover, the season will include a series of stellar brands that include Schiaparelli, currently enjoying a sturdy surrealist revival under American couturier Daniel Roseberry with a tight show inside its Place Vendôme headquarters. Other key catwalks to watch are rocker couturier Alexandre Vauthier; conceptualists Viktor & Rolf; the Levant’s master couturier Elie Saab; the two Roman-based houses Valentino and Fendi; and Stéphane Rolland, who stages his show in the Theatre National de Chaillot.
 
Attention will also focus on Jean Paul Gaultier, where Glenn Martens of Y/Project will become the second designer to be invited by the French couturier to create a Gaultier couture collection. Last season, this new collab’ concept began with Chitose Abe of Sacai.
 
“The key goal is to have wonderful shows. And we have a significant number of important physical catwalk shows,” noted the Federation president.
 
Paris has also introduced strict sanitary rules – from compulsory vaccinations to enter any show, obligatory PPF8 masks and social distancing, all the way to how brands shoot their videos.
 
Toledano was also careful to underline that the Federation expects couture houses to create high quality collection videos. After some early guffaws in show videos at the beginning of the pandemic, and some 30-second, single look mini fashion films, the Federation introduced stricter rules. With very specific instructions on video length and number of styles. At least four to seven-minute videos, and a minimum of 25 looks. 
 
The Federation has apparently turned down show videos in the current menswear season, preventing them from being shown on its much-followed international website, but Toledano declined to say whom. 
 
“The point of fashion week is to be better every season. That we insist on,” he concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 22, 2022","Friday in Paris Menswear was a tour of the city from an evangelical cathedral, cut-stone mansion, Marais showroom and Place des Victoires townhouse. We caught up with Jil Sander, Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Jeanerica.
 Jil Sander - Diabolical mode in a Yankee cathedralMasculine tailoring with feminine detailing in a sensational collection at Jil Sander, laced with frequently diabolical astrological signs, and staged inside the American Cathedral in Paris. 
The looming gothic revival Yankee church illuminated by a giant cinematic light, the better to enjoy the power of this winter 2022 collection.
 
Composed with grand, but never grandiose, volumes, in cloak-like evil genius proportions, and made in opulent cashmere herringbones, sleek tuxedo wool and creamy cashmeres.Working a dark palette of black, putty, burnt orange with a soupcon of ecru. Pretty well everything enhanced by lace or crocheted inserts, adding to the allure and aplomb. All looking very at home underneath the soaring oak vaults, stone chancel and marble columns.
 
Though the most brilliant ideas were eight funnel-neck coats, enveloping sweaters, cotton blouses and even pajamas covered in a brilliant stencils. Astrological signs of mean goats and naughty satyrs along with Taurus, Aries and Virgo.
 
All anchored by chunky boots with metal insignias, rectangular tool bag-style shoulder cases, and huge totes to give a utilitarian mood to the whole look.
 
Smartly styled, with multiple silk scarves as belts and straps, albeit with a hurried soundtrack, led by 'Summertime Clothes' by Animal Collective. For a winter collection? But, this is a small quibble about an impressive show and the strongest collection so far for the house of Jil Sander by their design duo of Lucie and Luke Meier. They took their bow with quiet dignity and then kissed as they strolled into the backstage sacristy.
 Paul Smith - A Brit’s take on BreathlessIt’s quite frankly a real pity that the pandemic prevented Paul Smith from staging a runway show and just presenting a nine-minute video, as this was the British designer’s strongest menswear statement in many years.
 Inspired by the Nouvelle Vague and the great icons of indie cinema, all the way to some instant collector's item silk and cotton shirts in bright graphic riffs on sixties French movie posters.
 
“Breathless was so modern. I first saw it when I was 18 and living in Nottingham and those French films were so fantastic,” enthused Smith, in a private presentation in his cut-stone Marais mansion Paris headquarters.
 
In the collection, he even worked in blue washes from David Lynch films and an oversized Prince of Wales double-breasted jacket that recalled, The Man Who Fell to Earth. The music for the video – where models marched in a ballroom - was composed exclusively by Paul’s old mate Richard Hartley, who did the music for Rocky Horror Picture Show and worked with Nicolas Roeg.
 
Lots of great hand-knit cable sweaters, caps and scarves - wonderful chunky knits handmade in Scotland in raspberry and Air Force blue.
 
Plus, Sir Paul created cunning volume, plaid trousers in wool crepe with unexpected inverted pleats, like the pants Bowie wore in that iconic image of the rock legend in Smith’s wide pants and very skinny sweater. Another cinematic reference were snug shearling jackets in maroon and red in the style favored by Jean-Luc Godard.
 
“What’s nice is that these guys were film critics, like Godard, who said, ‘I want to do something different.’ And he made his first film for something like 40,000 pounds. So, that was a huge inspiration to me to have a go and open my own store and brand,” explained Sir Paul.
 Isabel Marant - Couches, not clothes Perhaps it was the fatigue after 10 straight days of menswear shows and presentations, but at first glance the most interesting thing in the showroom of Isabel Marant were the couches. 
Undulating, magnificent, worn pewter-hued leather couches; they had the retro-modern panache that the clothes badly lacked. This winter 2022 had plenty of chunky, comfortable woolens, but far too often looked, ahem, banal.
 
The one thing one expects from Marant’s clothes and shows is plenty of zing, but all the contrasting panel winter hoodies; oversized parkas in Verona yellow and blue; loose-weave après ski pullovers, were conventional, rather than cool.
 
That said, there were some great denim looks, with apache motifs; natty workerist over-shirts and blousons in khaki and some fine jeans in a cracked marble print. All based on the collection’s saving grace – some excellent high-tops, male versions of Isabel’s signature, world-wide-hit female sneakers.
 
Still, one’s abiding memory will always be the chaise longues.
 Jeanerica - Euro denim in the MaraisTrue blue denim fanaticism at Jeanerica, a Swedish brand that is based on a never-ending love of the world’s most democratic fabric.Launched in 2018 by a former Acne staffer and Scandinavian fashion expert, Jeanerica offers all manner of slim-line shapes made in high-quality Italian denim. Textiles that managed to be sturdy, yet supple too. Produced in Turkey, in sustainable inclined factories, the jeans and forgivingly cut blousons and safari jackets, all looked very swish, in a presentation in the Marais. Aided by a great mix of colors: bleu de nuit; pacific blue; bright ecru and washed azure.
 
Add in some great sweatshirts, created in combinations of recycled and reused cotton to “create a foamy hand and finish,” explained founder Jonas Clason, the former head of Acne Studios. He founded Jeanerica as a European denim house with Lena Patriksson Keller, founder and chairman of the Patriksson Group and board member of H&M.

"Jan 21, 2022","Scandi fashion, which has been all the rage this past decade, finally made it onto a Paris runway Thursday lunchtime, doing so with a power puffe, super-hero show by Rains.Rains - Kierkegaard cool 
Rains is all about functional outerwear, but its design director, Tanne Vinter, was smart enough to take plenty of risks with this collection – showing loads of acid colors; taking risks with proportions and silhouette.“This collection is very much about colors. What I wanted was that northern light, these very mysterious colors you see dancing on the sky, but pulled out of darkness, out from the sky.  Like the lime and pink, we showed today,” explained the Rains designer.
 
That, and coolly adding semi-transparent materials “to add depth to the clothes,” continued Vinter, a tall, blond self-assured Viking with a mocking smile.Transparency also kicked up 3D like outfits, some finished with a Rains monogram. While Vinter’s sense of winter volume was also cool and witty, especially the fantastic horizontal ribbed puffer thigh boots, or the regal puffer collars and trains.
 
Rains is fundamentally a global outerwear lifestyle brand with the puffer at its center. But by creating a show of complete uniform looks, and going for extremes, Vinter developed a timely fashion statement about winter glamour and funky futurism. 
 
Talk about opening the door for Scandi fashion in Paris, the toughest fashion capital on the planet. No mean feat.
 Rick Owens - Light, action, strobesOne always needs a little commitment to watch a Rick Owens show, especially this season at the American’s “strobe show,” where the audience was more or less bombarded with flashing lights, and the cast marched with fluorescent lamp heads. 
Rick did, at least, forewarn us. And no guest in the show upstairs in Palais de Tokyo had a fit, so it all ended well. And the show was, well, something else.
 
Owens’ futuristic superhero returning from diastrophic battle concept has been one of the most influential in fashion this past decade. This season he took it somewhere new, mounting half-meter long, double fluorescent bulbs on Aztec party warriors. Who wore Brancusi-shaped bulbous down neck scarves and parkas; leather medieval minimalist knight leather cloaks and one-leg skirts that trailed behind the heel.
 
Weirdest of all were the leather and pony-skin headgear that came with built-in facemasks. Not quite a bring-out-the-gimp moment, but not so far.
 Uniforme - Milly la Fôret modeEveryone loves to talk about sustainable, but Uniforme really lives it.
 
Especially this season, with the reined in collection, highly covetable knits and utilitarian cool. All coming together in a perfectly judged video, shot inside a wooden pavilion home with huge glass windows near Fontainebleau: Airbnb heaven. 
One felt one was living in the forest, as the cast interacted with rocks and ancient forest near the old town of Milly La Fôret.
 
More importantly, Uniforme is sustainable in that the designers don’t make oodles of prototypes, but work directly with artisans and small factories, so reducing waste. Anyone who has witnessed major league designers scrambling to edit down collections from several hundred looks to just 50 passages the night before a show will know what we mean.
 
“We want to be a smaller scale business, and we want to be an out of trend brand. More an evolving wardrobe, looking for our perfection,” said Rémi Bats, who together with Hugues Fauchard co-founded the brand, after meeting at Paris fashion school Studio Berçot.
 
This season, they evolved their double-collar, high-neck cable sweaters and their architectural pullovers that sit gently off the back. Plus, the smart flannel outer-shirts made of flannel from Fox Brothers were very now. Smart casual made of dead stock, like over 90% of the collection. Hard to get more sustainable than that.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 20, 2022","Crocs, bucket hats and sweatpants have relegated suits and little black dresses to the closet, taking a well-deserved revenge on elegance, sophistication and chic.

The pandemic reshuffled the cards, reviving certain once reviled or mocked pieces, and spurring the luxury world to reinvent the codes of what was previously considered ugly.cre

In what seems like a click of the fingers -- or, at least, a year of the pandemic -- all things ugly have suddenly become even more desirable than the truly beautiful. They have now become chic when worn by the great and good of this world, in turn bringing these pieces to new heights of fashion. Anna Wintour, for example, made a major impact when she was photographed wearing jogging pants in her plush library, elevating a piece popularized by athletes and then appropriated by the street, to star fashion status. Sweatpants became 'THE' must-have piece of 2021. Previously associated with a more street thug, lowlife style, sweatpants were now suddenly sporting the logos of the world's biggest luxury fashion houses.From fashion rejects to catwalk starsCollaborations pairing luxury with ugly have continued to multiply, propelling pieces that were once frowned upon to ever greater heights. Christopher Kane and Balenciaga are some of the fashion houses that have 'dared' to collaborate with Crocs, making the rubber clog immediately more desirable -- as Justin Bieber showed when he had the audacity to wear them with socks. And the clog-sock combo has also shone on the catwalks this year.

Everything that has long been considered kitsch, tacky, vulgar or old-fashioned has seemingly been transformed into beautiful and desirable.

""This can be explained by the fact that a certain chic has become extremely mainstream. This is the basis of Pierre Bourdieu's ""La Distinction,"" which explains that the day the masses have access to the codes of the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie will reject these codes and will even do the exact opposite,"" explained Alice Pfeiffer, last May, on the occasion of the release of her book 'Le goût du moche' [A taste for the ugly].

Just like Crocs, the bucket hat has been invited into the collections of luxury fashion houses, along with the sleeveless down jacket, dad shoes, bling jewelry, and other pieces previously attributed to the working classes, to the street.Vulgar in vogueThe phenomenon grew throughout the year to the point that these pieces once considered ugly have slowly but surely become attractive -- or at least desirable -- in the collective imagination: low-cost retailer Lidl has also become highly desirable and -- whether or not it's down to marketing -- the idea that Lidl's fashion collections are being snapped up like hotcakes proves that the codes of the street have now risen to the top of the ladder.

The late Virgil Abloh is among those who helped propel these codes of the uncool onto the luxury scene via a host of collaborations, taking in names from Ikea to Nike to Levi's to Champion. Then there's Balenciaga -- a fashion house known for its non-conformism -- which designed a parka partway between a construction worker's jacket and garbage collectors' garb, as highlighted by many social media comments. And all for the modest sum of €2,990.

Times have changed, and the cyclical system of fashion has moved on, giving a new dimension to clothes -- less aesthetic, more functional, and above all, more centered on self-expression and self-affirmation.

"Jan 19, 2022","All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. And in few endeavors is that truer than in fashion, especially on Wednesday in Paris Fashion Week Menswear.
 
Among 16 shows, presentations and videos, an eclectic  quartet – a Briton, an Israeli, a Frenchman and a Swede – provided plenty of food for thought. FashionNetwork.com looks at the day’s highlights.
 BIANCA SAUNDERSIs Bianca Saunders the next big thing in menswear? Judging from her debut runway show staged in Paris on Wednesday, Saunders looks like she will have plenty of influence in her métier.Saunders makes clothes that are, at first glance, deceptively simple. She cuts with considerable subtlety, while placement of folds and tucks are unexpected and restrained.
 
Last year, Saunders nabbed the very prestigious ANDAM award, whose previous winners have included Martin Margiela and Iris Van Herpen, despite only have staged a handful of presentations, and no catwalk show. So, there was a great sense of expectation as the first looks came out inside the Palais de Tokyo. Very much an indie label, Bianca showed inside a space that bigger brands often use as their backstage. 
 
Saunders works with few prints, and there were few fireworks in this collection. Nonetheless the collection looked very special. Hems are displaced; patch-pockets seem to morph into coats; all folds seem novel.
 
Much of the collection was made in denim, with slightly askew seams; most garments looked oversized but never feeling disproportionate. One button-free jean-jacket and matching pants look was really magnificent. Another slim-line in indigo denim was pretty perfect too, as was an over-sized shirt jacket with front zip. They all managed to capture her understated but instantly recognizable DNA.
 
Sweaters with front folds; super elegant yet never stiff Donegal-tweed-style chesterfields; leather jackets with front plaquettes and some great crisp suits with subtle notches all had great aplomb. And the few graphic, computer-generated prints she showed also had punch and felt very right. 
 HED MAYNERMega volume yet mellifluous mode at Hed Mayner, the cerebral Israeli designer who was the Karl Lagerfeld Prize debut winner in the 2019 LVMH Prize.
 
Due to the pandemic Hed unveiled his winter 2022 collection in a video shot inside the Centre National de la Danse in Paris, in a great statement of avant-garde tailoring and exceptional outerwear. Mayner, in the four years since first showing in Paris, has built a reputation for rugged volume and huge silhouettes that owes nothing to Balenciaga.
 
Very much his own master, Mayner has a singular view or tailoring, especially in this collection, produced in Romania and as far north as Lithuania.
 
“We started with tailoring, first old school and very stiff but then took away, bit by bit, the padding and eventually moved to this blanket look. So, the whole profile and mood changed,” explained the Tel Aviv-based designer.
 
Just 28 looks, and not one of them redundant, all climaxing with marvelous matelassé blanket coats made of Liberty-style Alpine florals, for a soft, faded and bohemian image.
 
Mayner also worked with Macintosh to create a clever series of voluminous parkas, coats and humungous capes, incorporating the brand's rubberized techniques. Expect a proper capsule with the UK marque in the future.
 
Everything completed with “destroyed knits” hefty cable sweaters, pullover/scarves; woolly helmets – all coming with holes and worn seams.
 
And in the swish video, several female models wearing boyfriends’ coats and jackets – adding a soupçon of extra charm, as the soundtrack played ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache"" by master crooner Bryan Ferry.
 
Ideal for a broken-up collection by a designer with a singular vision.
 AMIThe omens looked promising before Wednesday’s AMI show in the Bourse de Paris, the city’s former stock exchange. A gaggle of French actresses and rappers in the front row, a cast of cool veterans – from Edie Campbell to, believe or not, Isabelle Adjani – and a mob of several hundred fans hunting for their Instagram images outside.
 
However, the muse never really quite sang in this collection – frequently retro; and a tad too predictable. Not that weren’t plenty of commercial clothes – from the volume overcoats to the houndstooth cabans. No surprise given AMI founder and designer Alexandre Mattiussi’s uncanny finger on the fashion pulse. Moreover, his kicky use of Day-Glo colors in kissing pink tuxedos or electric lime blazers did feel fresh.
 
But far too often, the clothes echoed French ideas of good tastes from the nineties. If someone had told you these men’s clothes – whether long gray flannel sack-suits or white wool parkas - were designed by Dominique Morlotti or Patrick Lavoix for Dior or Lanvin, or that the women’s clothes – from the muddy cheetah-print pony skin to oversized trenches - were from very late Saint Laurent, when Yves was almost in his dotage – well, you would have believed them.
 
The show was not helped by absurd staging, which had most of the audience placed in dank corridors around a huge atrium. Sadly, a classic example of inane catwalk production.
 
Given Mattiussi’s recent run of powerful collections, this show will surely be a temporary setback. One imagines Alexandre's ability to read the zeitgeist and his sense of fashion theatre will return and bloom again next season.
 ACNE STUDIOSNo show and no video at Acne Studios, but plenty of ideas all the same, from Scandinavia’s most important designer and the region’s most influential brand.
 
Giant d’Artagnan boots meet crazy waders; sculpted biker jackets; Lapland tracker boots designed for winter clubbing; and some great scrunched-up black leather blazers and redingotes with contrasting sherbet buttons – and that was just the leather selection.
 
Wild and wacky kitchen-rag-wool weaves sewn onto sequined shirts, which sounds like something of a mess – and was – but yet looked great. All staged inside Espace Commines in the Marais, site of Helmut Lang’s greatest shows a quarter century ago.
 
Painted over crocheted beanies and gloves; mashed-up silver clubbing shirts or crumpled summer trenches, as Acne Studio’s designer Jonny Johansson kept his creative thinking in overdrive. Who needs another video  when a designer’s ideas are that fresh?

"Jan 19, 2022","Spanish bridal wear group Pronovias has launched a line of modifiable wedding dresses that can be re-used after the big event. The project is called Second Life, and it relates to the group’s Pronovias and Nicole Milano brands.“Second Life wants to defy the conventional wisdom that wedding dresses are worn only once. After the wedding, customers can take their dress to select Pronovias and Nicole Milano stores and have it altered into a new model they will be able to wear again and again, at no additional cost,” said Pronovias.

The first collection for the Second Life project includes 70 modifiable dresses. The possible alterations include shortening the dress, removing the sleeves and adding new details, such as a belt or straps.“Bridal fashion isn’t really known for being circular. Second Life is trying to correct this issue and improve the sector’s environmental performance. It is a vital challenge for the future of our industry, and for the environment we are keen to preserve,” said Amandine Ohayon, CEO of Pronovias Group.Pronovias wants to go even further in terms of circularity. The group’s We Do Eco line, for example, is made up of dresses developed with sustainable fabrics and materials. Pronovias has also entered into a partnership with Recovo, a platform that promotes the recycling of fabric off-cuts to reduce the environmental impact of textile waste.

The Pronovias group is based in Barcelona. It has been the property of BC Partners since 2017, and its brand portfolio includes Pronovias, St Patrick, White One, Nicole Milano, Vera Wang Bride and Lady Bird. The group is present in over 105 countries through more than 4,000 retailers and 44 monobrand stores, located in the world's major capitals.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 19, 2022","Paris Menswear season – showing clothes for winter 2022 - opened Tuesday with an impressive trio of collections from three very disparate young designers, underlining the ability of the City of Light to attract dynamic, new talent, even in the never-ending pandemic.
 
A South African; a Franco-Filipino and a Paris-based duo showed highly contrasting shows and clothes in three distant arrondissements, each of them announcing their brands as distinctive new destinations for urban hipsters and followers of fashion who yearn for the new.
 
Below, we catch up with the trio - Lukhanyo Mdingi, Bluemarble and Egonlab - as Paris kicked off its six-day menswear season that ends on Sunday evening.
 Lukhanyo Mdingi – 'Into Africa'Paris menswear opened at 3 pm CET with a moment of grace, a sparsely attended event but very charming collection, cast and cultural moment by Lukhanyo Mdingi, a quietly spoken South African designer.A cool blend of African fabrics, preppy sensibility and rough local textiles unveiled in an obscure gallery in the eastern 11th arrondissement. Often echoing the great Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, though the collection emerged from a six-week stay by Mdingi in Burkina Faso, which borders Mali, in the latest interaction of the designer with an ethical fashion project.
 
“We found the most remarkable materials, and then blended them with our own sensibilities. Keeping true to ourselves but going somewhere new,” explained Mdingi, who entitled this array of clothes 'The Bodyland Collection'.All presented with dignity on a cast of color, in multiple hues and multiple afros – from funky to frizzy, pharaonic to fabulous. As small groups of models strolled around the gallery together, a traditional weaver worked in one corner and a musician carefully plucked the strings of a tall Kora – a plucked harp-lute - to serenade the cast.
 
In one tableaux, a quartet of proud beauty: a Moroccan teenager in lozenge-pattern polo shirt with matching pants; a Nigerian chap in a scrunched up wool tank finished with ropes and tassels; a Haitian beauty in a taught lapeled, three-button white pants suit; a Senegalese youth in a ribbed tank with huge black varsity scarf. All managing to look contemporary, yet very much part of the own Continent’s classical cool.
 Bluemarble – 'Archipelago Aesthetics'Filipino rock stars set sail in the latest nautical, natty and noble Bluemarble collection by founder Anthony Alvarez, very much a designer to watch in menswear.Nearly every look linked by maritime mode, like the brilliantly jumbled up, multi-button sailor’s pants worn over funky sneakers trimmed in faux gorilla fur in bitter orange or Clongowes purple.
 
Alvarez’s arty admirals marching around in a series of surreal seafaring duffle coats and parkas, inside a battered old building in a scruffy corner of Paris at the back of the Gare du Lyon. The best coats turned out to be made of tie-dye wool, as the designer tapped into his origins in the Philippines.
 
Best of all were the great patch-work graphic prints inspired by Vinta boats, a local tradition of decorating rectangular lug sails for important festivals in the south Philippines.

“They are so beautiful that when I discovered them I had to have them in this collection!” enthused the designer.
 
Part French and Filipino, Alvarez actually grew up in New York, and the supreme self-confidence of New Yorkers was well expressed in his rock-god finale with crystal-encrusted track pants; baggy skater jeans; fantasy paisley pants and primitive pattern crystalline cardigans.
 
“There was something about the huge egos of American rock stars that I wanted to capture,” conceded Alvarez, with a big smile in a pre-show preview.
 Egonlab – Coligny Cool'Spiritual matters at Egonlab, in a dramatic show in Paris’ most famous Protestant church, which opened with a tattooed face mock priest swinging a thurible of smoky incense.
 Held inside the Temple of the Oratory, outside of which stands a statue of Admiral Coligny, whose murder by supporters of Catherine de' Medici unleashed the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572.
 
Though this show’s decadent deacon was followed up by smart haute-tailored gents, in three-piece suits, whose third element could be a mini kilt, or a taught mini. 
 
In a co-ed collection, the Egonlab duo of Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix also showed femme fatales in razor-sharp black felt wool suits anchored by black platform boots; or strict black evening dresses with open backs into which the models looked poured.
 
Plus, the duo’s phantasmagorical toile de jouy-print shirts were sensational. All told, the collection was rather erratic – several bulbous padded puffers looked completely wrong, but when it comes to tailoring Egonlab offers something very new and very powerful. 
 
A punchy Parisian counter-blast to street luxury and all the better for that. Good to be back in Paris.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2022","Fendi's menswear continues to evolve into an increasingly sophisticated, hybrid-contemporary fashion universe. As demonstrated by the fine Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection designed by Silvia Fendi Venturini for the LVMH-owned Roman luxury house, which was unveiled on Saturday on the second day of Milan Fashion Week Men. Fendi Venturini is steering her menswear towards new horizons, delighting in contrasts: the past and the future, the masculine and the feminine, the minimalistic and the lavish. 
Spotlights climb slowly up to the ceiling, illuminating a narrow, elevated steel ramp down which the models tread, moving through a thick fog reminiscent of Victorian London. Carrying attaché cases and clad in wool overcoats and impeccably cut flannel suits, they seem to be coming from the City, or an elite gentlemen's club.
 
The atmosphere is elegant and affluent. The collection’s palette is chic and understated (beige, white, black, grey, mocha and burgundy), featuring muted monochrome sets accented by details like a flower on a buttonhole or subtly embroidered knee-length socks. The overcoats are long and cut from fine fabrics. A shorts-and-jacket set in houndstooth tweed is worn tone-on-tone with a bob hat, the model’s eyeglasses frame and an ample overcoat made in matching fabric.Little by little, Fendi’s traditional men's wardrobe incorporates discreet flights of fancy, blending with a contemporary, often futuristic landscape. A classic jacket is cut open on all sides, morphing into a mini cape, or is layered over the coat for a frock-coat effect. The retro feel is heightened by the use of classic menswear fabrics with houndstooth or check patterns. The soft knitted sweaters feature triangular slits just below the neck, on the sternum.
 Some of the silhouettes veer towards the feminine, sporting pop 3D prints in pearl and diamond motifs, trousers fastened at the back by a single piece of fabric resembling a skirt, maxi tunics and knitted dresses. In the same vein, necklines are softer and slightly rounded, and suit jackets, coats and casual jackets often shed their collars, creating unexpected effects by baring the neck and the top of the shoulders.

This drift towards femininity is accentuated in many looks through the use of accessories, like the small cross-shoulder handbags worn by virtually all the models, the jewellery, earrings and even removable turtlenecks trimmed with pearl necklaces. On an evening out, Fendi men will wear uber-chic tailcoat dinner jackets and won’t leave without a clutch bag, carried at the end of a thin golden chain, and their two-tone Mary Jane wingtip brogues featuring a watch on their straps. Not so practical for telling the time, but so directional ...

Fendi’s new collection places great emphasis on sumptuous, very special fashion accessories, from handbags to jewellery, hats, eyewear and socks. And on logos too, as many of the items are decorated with the house’s renowned double F monogram, created by Karl Lagerfeld in 1965, and the new interlocking chain monogram.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2022","Luxury label Pierre Cardin is set to return to Paris Fashion Week in a bid to breathe new life into the brand, its new boss told AFP, just over a year after the death of its legendary founder.

The famed couturier died in December 2020 at the age of 98, having built a hugely profitable business empire by licensing his name around the world.He stayed in the spotlight to the very end, with blockbuster shows in Russia, Kazakhstan and even on the Great Wall of China in the last years of his life.

But Cardin stayed away from the official fashion calendar in his last two decades -- and that is something his nephew and hand-picked successor Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin wants to reverse.""Pierre wanted to be free,"" Basilicati-Cardin told AFP in an interview ahead of the latest Paris Fashion Week, which kicks off on Tuesday.

""As he approached his 80th birthday, he said there were lots of young designers who needed to be part of fashion week and he didn't want to get in their way.""

But Basilicati-Cardin says it is time to relaunch the brand.

The first step is a special commemorative show dedicated to the label's founder on January 28 at the end of the haute couture week.Out of this world""We want to return to fashion week, at least once a year,"" said the new CEO. ""We need the publicity.

""My uncle did a lot and the publicity came naturally. But he dedicated the last part of his life to creativity, not to distribution,"" he added.

Cardin helped revolutionise fashion in the 1960s and 1970s with bold and futuristic designs that tapped into the excitement around the space age.

Not for nothing is the tribute show being staged at the Air and Space Museum outside Paris.

""We wanted the theme to be outer space to evoke the 1960s, when Pierre Cardin wanted to dress the sort of person who travels on spaceships,"" said his nephew.

""He was the first -- the only who dared to do that alongside Andre Courreges -- and was criticised by everyone at the time.""

But from the 1970s, Cardin began licensing his brand name to hundreds of other companies and products, from food mixers to answering machines to -- famously -- tinned sardines.

It was an immensely profitable move, and one that Cardin never regretted, telling the New York Times in 2002: ""During the war, I would have rather smelled the scent of sardines than of perfume.""

But for some, these licensing deals also reduced the brand's allure, as its name was plastered across bargain-basement clothing all over the globe.'A certain simplicity'Basilicati-Cardin, an engineer and graphic designer by training, was chosen to take over by his uncle in 2018, having worked alongside him since the 1990s, primarily on accessories.

""He really liked a certain simplicity, the love of the curve. He explained things to me that I was doing instinctively,"" Basilicati-Cardin said.

Now CEO, he still designs glasses and picks ideas to be developed in future collections.

""In one design out of 50, I find something new, I jump on it,"" he said.

But he recognises a need to ""rejuvenate"" the storied label, perhaps with a new group of designers from outside.

Never without forgetting their legendary founder: plans are in place for another major commemoration in July to mark Cardin's 100th birthday -- this time perhaps in Venice.Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Jan 17, 2022","A welcome return to ruddy health at Prada, where Muiccia Prada and Raf Simons unveiled their best menswear collection to date, worn by the city’s best cast.
 
Kyle MacLachlan opened the action it a dramatically cut midnight wrap around topcoat, like some duke returning from a successful deal-making excursion. Jeff Goldblum in a matt black gents coat finished with hefty faux astrakhan armbands and ultra-wide trim. Where Kyle marched with a patrician, bien dans sa peau air, Jeff swung his arms actively like a swimmer treading through light surf. And, in some perfectly styling, MacLachlan’s dark blue coat was smartly contrasted by wine, Carolina-blue lightweight trousers and leather gloves. 
 
All staged with magnificence inside the Deposito of the Fondazione Prada’s main hanger kitted out like a cinematic cathedral with a pale green carpet which also climbed up the soaring concrete columns.Pale makeup courtesy of Pat McGrath adding to the cinematic look of the cast, who often looked like big-featured silent movie era stars. No surprising as there was also a quirky blend of weathered and fresh face actors including Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Asa Butterfield, Damson Idris, Tom Mercier, Jaden Michael, Louis Partridge, Ashton Sanders and Filippo Scotti. 
 Though the key to this collection was the tailoring, in a show where Miuccia and Raf sounded another death knell for the shapeless era of baggy luxury streetwear. Starring some raffishly cut double-breasted jackets with completely hidden buttons; foamy felt-wrapped redingotes and a great series of bravura German Expressionist chic spy coats with hyper-wide shoulders in burnt red, gun metal gray or Prussian blue.
 
“The collection celebrates the idea of working - in all different spheres and meanings. It is a practical, everyday thing. But here, you are formally important. You are not casual. And through these clothes, we emphasize that everything a human being does is important. Every aspect of reality can be elegant and dignified. Elevated, and celebrated,” said Miuccia in a release.
 
Due to Covid concerns, the backstage was officially closed.

Within minutes of the show, the whingeing warriors of Diet Prada were effectively claiming that Raf and Miuccia had copied the voluminous silhouette of Balenciaga. Sticking together a look from Balenciaga that, to the untutored eye, had some similarities with one of today's Stasi coats.
 
On closer inspection, that Slavic thrift-shop aesthetic of Balenciaga was far distant from the polished Italian luxury of Prada. But, the moaners will always be with us, won't they? 
Otherwise, this Prada collection included some high-tech nylon space suits and jumpsuits that looked ideal while carrying a Geiger counter in a radioactive plant. All kitted out with matching backpacks and satchels.
 
Multiple balloon coats in the brand’s signature nylon in suitably moody hues rounded off the show. Nearly every look featuring some version of the Prada v-shaped logo, all the way to absurdist mini cartridge boxes worn at the small of the back.
 
And in an obvious poke in the eye to critics of Simons who say he has cheapened the brand with the endless V signifiers, which has included V-shaped earrings, the duo sent out mini toy-robot earrings, for guys.
 
Driven on by a great Human League remix soundtrack this was quite simply the most important statement in menswear so far in 2022. That good.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 16, 2022","Nothing like a new management to liberate a venerable brand and unleash the potential of a talented designer. Which was very much the feeling on Sunday at noon in Milan, when Kean Etro staged one of his snappiest and youngest collections for his family-named house.

The show marked the first menswear runway outing by Etro since the giant French conglomerate LVMH – via L Catterton - acquired a majority stake in the Italian firm in July last year.
 
In an operation that valued Etro at 500 million euros, it looks as if LVMH got themselves a pretty good deal. Especially after this kicky show, staged inside Bocconi, Italy’s top ranked business school, located in south Milan. 
Kean playing on the brand’s DNA craftily. Etro is the king of Italian paisley, and the catwalk was one massive patchwork carpet of paisley, with the brand’s name hand-written in multiple versions.
 
Entitled 'Ex Libris', which roughly translates from Latin as the book “owned by,” the collection included a series of graphic paisleys seen in cashmere roll neck pullovers, chunky alpine sweaters; and some beautiful intarsia woolens featuring designs of wolves and smoldering tigers.A famously generous spirit, Kean sent copies of classic short novels and philosophical tracts to guests with the show invitations. Literature like the meditations of Maria Maddalena de Pazzi, the Carmelite nun and mystic, entitled The Words of Ecstasy.
 “Tomes that disclose journeys of emotions and knowledge… A new mental order can be felt, as crisp as the January light. The journey, whether it is knowledge or adventure, requires a map and map requires clarity, which is not about schematic but about being lucid,” opined Kean, Milan’s fashion philosopher in residence.

Etro’s DNA has always been about weekend nonchalance for a discerning gent, and Kean provided plenty of that from sky blue grandfather shirts and great ski-sweaters emblazoned with spiky rose designs and the simple statement Jioia, or Joy.
 
Above all, Kean seemed liberated from the silken bonds of his family and stiff clan mores, giving the mood a charming haute-boho attitude. Notably, in a beautiful tuxedo and pant-edged pants, except they came in burnish orange with matching ribbed knitwear tank; or a tremendous playboy black suit dissected by a knit cummerbund.
 
That said, Etro will always be a maximalist marque, and the paisley carpet pattern soon appeared in billowing pants, with deep front pockets, ideal to hold a short novel; or seen in wolves-howling-at-the-moon pattern pullovers. Perfect après ski clobber, and a highlight in what felt like a liberating collection for Kean, for the house, and even LVMH.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2022","Right when you were thinking one could drown in all the laudable sustainable menswear on display in Milan, along comes Dolce & Gabbana to wake the whole city up with some moda alla Machine Gun Kelly on Saturday. 

Even before the season had begun on Friday, Kelly and his fiancé Megan Fox had caused a sensation in the Italian fashion capital when paparazzi captured her exiting Dolce & Gabbana’s headquarters sporting a giant bling diamond ring, fresh from his recent proposal in Puerto Rico to the actress. 
The American rocker and rapper opened and closed the show, first in a glistening ivory suit cut with double-breasted eight-button jacket, and last in a star-studded black suit with peg-leg pants and oversized jacket. Somehow, it looked like they had dyed his hair from platinum blonde to Celtic red during the show. 
 
For his final passage, Machine Gun even took off his jacket and handed it gallantly to Megan in the front row. Fox mock swooned.Kelly was also kept performing several of his best tunes, and playing both organ and guitar, climaxing with 'Bloody Valentine'. 
 
Throughout, both the backdrop and the catwalk were giant videos of graffiti graphics and agitprop patterns. The same graffiti used in fantastic Lower East Side futura 2000-style coats, puffers, over-shirts and gigantic cargo pants. 
Some of the puffers and down coats were so monumental they made Balenciaga look minimalist. While the collection was also crammed with DG logos – seen in chunky knits; monogram priestly coats; ski bonnets and huge totes. So many logos it echoed the now discontinued D&G of the aughts.
 
And just when the graphics got overpowering, Domenico and Stefano suddenly changed gear and sent out some wickedly well-cut tailoring – perfectly hung, wraparound tuxedos worn with leggings; freakishly wide-shouldered velour bomber jackets and surgically sharp jackets with reversed lapels.
 
It being Dolce & Gabbana, there had to be some tight underwear worn by boys with machine gun abs, this month paired with boxing champion dressing gowns and kingly, rap-god wraps with fur collars. 
The collection was about ten looks too long, but it didn’t really matter, as the show was powered along by Kelly’s rolling soundtrack.
 
“The simulation just went bad. But you're the best I ever had. Like hand prints in wet cement. She touched me it's permanent,” roared out the hip-hop rocker from Cleveland.

"Jan 15, 2022","The brothers Caten returned to their Canadian roots this season with a DSquared2 collection ideal for Deep North dandies and hipster trappers.
 
Like the terrain in the Klondike, their catwalk undulated and twisted around the interiors of the show-space in piazza Lina Bo Bardi, the center of Milan’s new high-tech district of Porta Nuova. 
“It’s been two long years and just great to be back. We’re alive and excited and we’re nervous. But that’s just the way fashion is meant to be right now. Fashion is our life, so that said please be safe, respect the distance from your neighbor and enjoy our trip,” said Dean, as he and Dan took a pre-show tour of the undulating catwalk.
 
Like at every show in Italy, all guests were obliged to present 'green passes', the local term for a vaccine QR code, wear PPF8 masks, and sit two meters apart. Except at DSquared2, guests often sat on several battered suitcases to witness the show.One of four runway shows featuring live models staged on Friday, the opening day of the five-day Milan menswear season for fall/winter 2022, which is schedule to feature just under 20 live catwalk events, and several score of presentations in the Italian fashion capital. The lockdowns have clearly made the Canadian brothers yearn for the great outdoors of their youth, with a collection boasting fly-fishing jackets; active ski-gear, hiking boots and all-weather parkas.
 
A show that opened with a humongous sleeping bag-style padded parka and plaid jacket worn as a skirt, topped by a Indian knit bonnet and anchored by Pinto pony skin boots.
 
Wrapped in massive plaid blankets and marching in padded gaiters, the cast clearly loved their maximalist clothes - zigzag Inuit woolen jackets; punky trapper shearling jackets; rubberized parkas and camouflage cargo pants.
 
Though these are men whose hikes end in after-hours clubs, attired in harlequin print sweaters made of padded nylon; ballooning patchwork puffers and metallic plaid shearling gilets.In short, the collection managed to be folksy yet funky, even including cool new DSquared2 X Invicta collab’ sweatshirts, like the ones worn by the Caten brothers when they toured the runway.
 
Entitled '#D3Hi_king', the collection was the latest fashion expression of the desire to escape the confinement of lockdown and get back to raw nature.
 
Or as the Catens put it: “#D3Hi_king plays on words: Get high on life and rule the world as you discover it one mountain at a time.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2022","“We only knit what we know,” explained Alessandro Sartori as he presented his new modular mode collection for the house of Zegna. 
A blend of private presentation and grand digital display, the Zegna winter 2022 collection kicked off the Milan menswear season on Friday afternoon.
 
Sartori’s latest path-breaking clothes for the house was all about injecting technical advances and multi-purpose garments into a modern man’s normal wardrobe - from his artful over-layering to deft interior construction to remarkable cashmere inner linings. The collection also marked the first full offering since the house was rebranded with one collection called Zegna, rather than three bearing the name Ermenegildo Zegna.One of fashion’s greatest tailors, Sartori whipped up small very cool wool jackets bonded on the inside in cashmere knit. While a forgiving new over-shirt in water-repellant suede boasted a lining of cashmere Donegal yarn knit. 
“We use the purest of cashmere where we know each individual farmer, and they only sell to Zegna,” underlined Sartori.
 
Even footwear got a mega make-over – with boots in techy leathers lined in technical jersey.
 
“It’s a technical take on menswear couture,” commented Sartori, who invited a small group of barely 50 to the Zegna HQ on Via Savonna, to witness this semi-phygital show. A show video that climaxed with a giant cast - wearing the new Zegna logo colors of black and dusty rust - surrounding the Duomo. 
 
“We were actually just a few hundred at 6 a.m. on a very cold morning. But we make them look like 6,000 extras,” laughed Sartori.
 
Perched on socially distant seats and all wearing PPF8 marks, they witnessed a pre-recorded projection on the digital platform and in the HQ. A fashion film, which boasted a mass performance by the choreographer of the moment Sadeck Waff and images of models marching in Alpine hills and a metaphysical in-door studio.
 
“We wanted to offer multiple layers of the collection. In this case, due the pandemic, 90% digital and 10% live,” stressed the designer of Zegna, which began its quotation on the New York stock exchange in December in a two-billion-dollar-plus flotation. 
Like the stock quotation – using new-fangled financial techniques – the color palette was also subtle: soft white, vicuna, mahogany, and even grass. As was the silhouette – like the anorak-shaped tunic made in water-repellant shearling, with knit lining and underneath a high polo neck. Or boxy over-shirt jackets with tight, brushed heavy cotton shirts underneath. Or large cabans, in micro wool and mohair done with a waxy leather finish that is totally water repellant. Best of his diagonal-zip twisted tunics that will be cult items for sartorially significant guys.
 
All worn over billowing tubular trousers and tight-ankle pants.  In a collection crammed with crafty details – notably patch pockets more fused than stitched onto jackets.
 
In knitwear Ale even showed Aran-style pullovers, made of worsted yarns and eight-ply cashmere all woven by hand, like an erratic Aran, where each piece is different from all others.
 
Addressing the audience in Italian and English post-show, the designer was fulsome in his praise of Zegna artisans. “We had 80 artisans, 160 hands just devoted to this collection for months,” he enthused.
 
While for evening, Zegna offered artfully architectural coats, composed in very novel Japanese pure wool denim, cut with a very dropped half-Raglan shoulder to create a gentle slope. Continuing the theme of Sartori’s most recent collection – a Zegna Outdoors capsule that dropped in December.
 
“It’s a modular system – with less colors but similar colors. Multiple variations in shade and not color. I want to redefine today’s wardrobe,” concluded Sartori.
 
Which Sartori definitely managed to do.

"Jan 14, 2022","PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger has named the winners of its third Fashion Frontier Challenge, the dedicated global programme designed to “find and support ideas that lead to a more inclusive fashion landscape”.The winning names are Netherlands-based Lalaland and Rwanda’s Uzuri K&Y.

They were selected at a virtual event this week at which the six finalists pitched their concepts to a jury panel. The winners share a prize fund of €200,000 and receive a year-long mentorship with experts from Tommy Hilfiger and from graduate business school INSEAD.

Lalaland is a platform that uses artificial intelligence to generate customised and inclusive synthetic models of different ethnicities. It was awarded €100,000. 

The same amount went to Uzuri K&Y, a Rwanda-based eco-friendly shoe brand using recycled car tyres from sub-Saharan Africa and employing local youth.

Meanwhile South-Africa’s Clothes to Good, a social enterprise that creates micro-business opportunities and jobs for people with disabilities through textile recycling, was also awarded €15,000.

The six finalists had been whittled down from 430 start-ups from 22 countries who’d originally submitted their ideas last January.

The programme for this latest year particularly aimed to “amplify and support Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) entrepreneurs who are working to advance their communities, while fostering a more inclusive future for the fashion industry”.

And it was interesting that for the first time, the public was able to participate in the initial phases of the challenge, casting digital votes to help narrow down the applications to identify the finalists. Alongside Tommy Hilfiger associates at the final event, they were also invited to vote for their favourite pitch to award that additional €15,000 to one of the finalists.

"Jan 14, 2022","Ralph Lauren is delving deeper into material innovation, announcing on Thursday the launch of a sustainable performance polo shirt, set to make its debut at the 2022 Australian Open in Melbourne next week.

Dubbed the 'RLX Clarus Polo Shirt', the high-performance cotton polo is made from a first-to-market patented platform to transform virgin and recycled cotton. Retaining the comfort and breathability of luxury cotton, the shirt's fibres are enhanced with moisture-wicking and quick-drying capabilities, resulting in a material that performs much like plastic-based synthetic fabrics, polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels, said the U.S. luxury brand in a press release.“Ralph Lauren is known for timelessness – and for more than 50 years being timeless has meant both leaning into our heritage and fostering pioneering innovation,"" said David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer.

""With the introduction of the RLX Clarus Polo Shirt, we are using our most iconic product as a canvas to launch an industry-changing and scalable textile technology –a high-performance apparel product that is created with natural fibers for the first time. We’re proud to build on the brand’s legacy of signature and authentic style, reinvented for the future,"" Lauren added.To bring the RLX Clarus Polo to life, Ralph Lauren tapped the textile innovation expertise of Natural Fiber Welding (NFW), a sustainable material science startup that the New York brand invested in, last August.

""Through this collaboration, we are paving the way for complete circularity with resulting materials that perform similarly to plastic-based synthetic fabrics,” said Luke Haverhals, CEO at NFW.

“We are pioneering an entirely new system that simultaneously enables all-natural performance fabrics while reducing waste and eliminating the need for synthetic plastics.”

During the 2022 Australian Open, Ralph Lauren will host an exhibition tennis clinic with tennis legend, Sam Groth, and Josh Cavallo, a professional Australian football player. Groth and Cavallo will wear the new RLX Clarus Polo Shirt during the clinic, before the shirt becomes available globally for purchase.

The polo shirt release is part of Ralph Lauren's wider commitment to investing in the infrastructure and technologies, like NFW, to develop and scale a circular apparel economy.

Looking ahead, Ralph Lauren said it hopes to to expand its use of recycled cotton, helping to advance the company’s progress toward sustainably sourcing 100 percent of its key materials, including cotton, by 2025 and integrating zero-waste principles across its business.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2022","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) on Thursday released its official New York Fashion Week lineup for February, which sees a host of new and big-name designers set to showcase their latest collections in the Big Apple for the Fall 2022 season.In partnership with IMG, the seven-day New York Fashion Week American Collections Calendar will see runways and presentations from a plethora of big-name brands including Anna Sui, Christian Siriano, Dion Lee, Gabriela Hearst, Jason Wu, and Joseph Altuzarra of Altuzarra.

"Jan 13, 2022","Italy, like its European neighbours, will have to wait another year before its apparel market will grow back to its pre-pandemic levels. This is the forecast made by auditing and consulting firm PwC Italia, set out in a study that was presented in Florence on Monday, on the eve of the Pitti Uomo menswear show’s opening. PwC indicated that the sector should get back to normal in 2023, generating a revenue of €81.3 billion, up from the €78 billion forecast for 2022.While in the first half of 2021, with sales up by 24% on an annual basis, the Italian fashion industry was able to bounce back from a 2020 marked by the Covid-19 crisis, it was not however able to return to its 2019 revenue levels. Travel restrictions and the absence of wealthy tourists will still penalise the industry this year. Europe will notably be the region most affected, while Asia, with China leading the way, will continue to grow, as will the USA, both regions being crucial markets for Italian labels.
 
Besides textiles and apparel, the industry includes footwear, leather accessories, luggage, jewellery and goldsmithing, eyewear, cosmetics and perfumes. It accounts for approximately 12% of Italy’s entire manufacturing sector in terms of value added, and about 14% in terms of employment. Another feature of Italy’s textile and apparel industry is its dynamic export performance, generating a trade surplus in excess of €30 billion.In 2021, the Italian fashion industry had to deal with three underlying trends, according to PwC. The first is the widespread rise of digitalisation and e-commerce. “According to Eurostat data, in 2021, 31% of Italian consumers aged between 16 and 74 purchased products online, compared with a European average of 56%. Despite this gap, the increase in online purchases is forcing companies to develop an effective digital customer experience,” said the study.Reinventing collectionsAnother significant trend is the massive adoption of remote working, prompting fashion labels to rethink their collections by reinventing a cosier formal style, while simultaneously favouring the boom in sports and outdoor wear. Finally, the third growing phenomenon is customer demand for a genuine environmental commitment on the part of brands.“Sustainability is not a short-term trend: from January 1 2022, recycling textile waste will become mandatory in Italy, and the second-hand and resale markets, as well as the introduction of increasingly efficient methods of fabric disposal and recycling, will be at the heart of the operational and commercial models of Italy's fashion industry,” said Erika Andreetta of PwC Italia. “Brands will have to stop thinking in terms of number of units sold, but in terms of their [products’] repeat usage, so as to extend their life cycle and facilitate their disposal,” she added.
 Centre of gravity shift for luxury consumptionOutside Italy, fashion groups that have “performed” well in 2021 are those with a pre-eminent position in fast-growing sectors such as sportswear, outdoor apparel and equipment and e-tail, as well as leading luxury groups. The gap has further widened between giant corporations, richly endowed with financial and managerial resources, and small and medium-sized companies, triggering a plethora of acquisitions.  

Geographically, the centre of gravity for luxury shopping has shifted towards Asia and the USA, as tourist flows have dried up and localised consumer spending has increased. The clientèle has grown significantly younger and is now more attentive to issues of sustainability and ethics.

According to the study, “improving industrial processes and operational efficiency enabled companies to survive in 2020-2021, but this is no longer enough to stimulate future growth,” driving brands to further boost their digitalisation, sustainable development and international expansion.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 13, 2022","The fifth wave of the Covid pandemic and its Omicron variant are spreading across Italy, and the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) has had to modify the programme of Milan Fashion Week Men, which now features only four physical shows per day. The fashion week, scheduled in Milan on January 14-18, has been hit by calendar changes and withdrawals, but the five days devoted to the menswear collections for the Fall/Winter 2022-23 promise to be no less attractive, brightened by many novelties.For health-protection reasons, Giorgio Armani has decided to cancel all its shows, planned for Giorgio Armani and Emporio. In Armani’s wake, other labels, like MSGM, have opted to cancel their physical shows and switch to digital formats, taking some of the shine off the Milanese event. And this despite CNMI’s earnest recommendations to its members, asking them to hold steady.

Of the six new names that were set to debut on the Milanese runways this season, Irish designer Jonathan Anderson and his JW Anderson label, and Claudio Antonioli's new label, 44 Label Group, have both decided to switch to digital.The week can however count on the other four names making their maiden appearance in Milan, whose runway shows are confirmed: 1017 Alyx 9SM, the label by American designer Matthew Williams, who is also the creative director of Givenchy, as well as Federico Cina, JordanLuca and Justin Gall, three of the most interesting emerging labels around.

Among Italy’s premier names, Zegna, Dsquared2, Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, Philipp Plein, Etro and Prada have all confirmed their shows. The week’s last day, Tuesday 18, will be dedicated to digital shows including, among others, A-Cold-Wall, Children of the Discordance and Serdar.Shows for the select fewAltogether, the organisers have 60 events on the programme. This season’s Milan Fashion Week Men calendar, with its 53 labels, comprises “16 physical shows, 22 presentations, 18 digital shows and seven special events.” Due to the pandemic, the shows will welcome only a limited number of guests, up to 100, and most of the shows will also be streamed live online.The gala evenings and special events programme too has been cut down to size, since many of the happenings initially planned have been cancelled. However, participants will still be able to attend a number of important events, such as the eighth edition of Fashion Film Festival Milano, the tribute exhibition for photographer Giovanni Gastel, and the exhibition dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Italian sportswear label C.P. Company.

Finally, Louis Vuitton will give a new look to its Milanese flagship on via Montenapoleone for the fashion week, with a stunning, unique installation paying tribute to Virgil Abloh. A sculpture of a toy aircraft, a recurring symbol for Louis Vuitton’s creative director, who died on November 28, will have pride of place in the store’s courtyard, while the window displays and ground floor will feature a chessboard on which mannequins and giant chess pieces will be arrayed, showcasing the last menswear collection designed by Abloh, for Spring/Summer 2022, an advance preview of which will be available for sale in Milan.

"Jan 13, 2022","Online platforms that are precursors of the metaverse vision for the internet's future are already serving as workrooms to develop products destined for real-life sale.

From sneakers sketched in the virtual world but produced in the real one, to designers who preview clothes on avatars before making them -- the barrier between digital and tangible is thinning.""In real life, it's extremely expensive to make any product,"" said French couture designer Julien Fournie, who runs his own eponymous fashion house.

Online is ""a place of openness to test things virtually and recreate an extremely precise connection with the real-life experience,"" he added.The clamor over virtual goods comes amid feverish predictions that the metaverse -- a virtual reality version of the internet -- will eventually replace the web of today.

In recent months, a growing number of brands have been trying to establish a presence on buzzed-about platforms from Roblox to Fortnite, for fear of missing a major tech and societal shift.

How users interact with online goods -- what they flock to and what they ignore -- offers a relatively low-risk and low-cost opportunity for firms to develop products.

This is part of an underlying trend of exploiting data collected online ""to develop better collections, to do better forecasting"" said Achim Berg, partner at McKinsey & Company consulting.

The coronavirus pandemic has helped shrink the distance between virtual and real by pushing many designers to create in three dimensions, for lack of being able to meet physically, the consultant added.Opportunity for young designersAt the end of February 2021, RTFKT studio, together with Seattle artist FEWOCiOUS, launched a limited edition of 621 pairs of virtual sneakers via their NFT -- digital items that can be bought and sold using blockchain technology.

One aspect of the operation was to match each digital pair sold that day with tangible shoes, which each buyer could pick up six weeks later.

""We think that emotional bond to physical objects is still important and can increase the attachment"" to digital products, Benoit Pagotto, one of the founders of RTFKT, which was acquired by giant Nike in December, told The Wall Street Journal.

The Aglet app, which mixes virtual sneakers and augmented reality, has created its Telga shoes, similarly to heavyweights Adidas or Reebok.

Now it plans to make real sneakers, said the company's CEO Ryan David Mullins, who noted the first batch of 500 has already been sold before production even began.

""Once you can quantify the demand within these platforms, it makes it much easier to build the channel into the physical world to manufacture them,"" he added.

Aglet noted the firm is starting to work with younger designers, for whom the cost of entry to building their own physical brand can be a little bit too steep.

""But starting to design it virtually is much easier,"" he said.

Another variation of the growth online, is the high-end fashion platform Farfetch, which in August launched a formula that allows people to pre-order Balenciaga, Off-White or Dolce & Gabbana items that are only digital.

The site has collaborated with the studio DressX, which designs virtual clothes, to achieve a rendering that is as convincing as possible.

The pieces are then manufactured in the workshop only according to the pre-orders, a set-up that is especially attractive for high-end brands rather than for ready-to-wear behemoths.

That way of working can also help avoid overproduction and unsold goods, which have become a concern for the environmental costs associated with them.

Not all, however, are convinced by the vision of making the digital into the tangible.

""Digital pieces can be worn, collected and traded in the metaverse so there's no need for physical counterparts,"" said The Fabricant, a virtual fashion house.

The Dutch company still sees the permeability between the two worlds as a good thing when people choose ""to bring the aesthetic of the virtual world into their physical lives.""

""In the end, it's about desirability,"" said Berg, the consultant. ""If it is desirable in that (virtual) space, why wouldn't it be desirable in another space?"" Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Jan 13, 2022","Finally, a proper actual live runway show of re-defined masculine menswear in Pitti, staged late Wednesday inside a Pucci family Palazzo in Florence, courtesy of gender-bender designer Ervin Latimer.

“Treat that suit with respect bitch,” insisted Ervin as he MCed the show, and one tiny black-haired Vogueing model spun around the terrazzo floor of the 17th palazzo.One of just nine passages in a collection that featured deconstructed menswear worn by boys and gals in a natty Nordic take on tailoring.
 
While Ervin marched around – microphone in hand – in a fire engine red hyper fringed leotard, matching tights, high heels, head finished with a gigantic blonde wig.His cast mainly assembled from ballroom club culture in Helsinki, where Ervin is based.
 
In effect, the show and collection spoke volumes about how the new generation are breaking down ancient barriers and injecting contemporary concepts on what is unisex, transgender or cross dressing.
 
Latimer’s suits are often not two piece but sometimes five piece - with chopped off gilets, miniskirts and tank tops added to the mix. While his sense of silhouette ain’t half bad either. Ervin cuts great elephantine trousers, while his loon pants with slashes impressed too.
 
“Own it baby. And carry your own shit baby. You ain’t got nothing on this bitch y’all,” continued Ervin in his after-hours tranny club patter, cheers on by a crowd of about 150 guests – all wearing masks - at one of two shows. 
A graduate from Aalto University, Helsinki, Latimer has had a thoroughly respectable career in fashion working for brands like 1017 Alyx 9SM and Heliot Emil, before launching his own label. Besides being a designer, Latimer writes and lectures on the intersections of queer-culture, anti-racism, masculinity and fashion. 
 
Wednesday night’s show also represents the launch of his luxury label at Pitti Uomo, the 101 edition of Florentine menswear fair.
 
“The definition of masculinity is narrow. Our new collection is not unisex, nor defined as ‘menswear’, but rather aimed for anyone who wants to highlight or examine masculinity within themselves,” said Latimer. 
 
“Fashion should liberate us, not limit us. We challenge both who can perform masculinity and what kind of clothing can be used to do that. Furthermore, we also expand what Nordic fashion looks like. Our collection features suits and shirts, but also dresses and skirts. Most people when they think of Finland see tall lanky blondes, but we are a lot more diverse culture than that!” Ervin told FashionNetwork.com.
 
Though named after the designer’s surname, Latimmier also means in an Old French 'interpreter or translator', which also sums up this designer’s role in Scandi fashion.
 
Moreover, after a low-key Pitti, where most every life event was cancelled due to sanitary concerns it was refreshing to witness a brand and cast that clearly loved their Warholian moment of fame in Tuscany.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 12, 2022","“Bonsoir,” says an offstage voice in French, in the darkness. “And welcome to the Paszkowski Café for the runway show by Madame Chiara Boni,” continues the voice, bidding the audience to enjoy the latest creations by the Italian designer, whose stretch jersey outfits, both chic and easy to wear, are the signature items of her La Petite Robe label. For Pitti Uomo, Boni opted to go back to her native Florence, staging a surprise runway show at the historic Paszkowski Café.Chiara Boni’s was the first fashion show of 2022, held for a select number of guests seated at the café’s tables in a convivial atmosphere. It was a success, and brought a sprinkle of festive glamour to menswear show Pitti Uomo, which is having to do without its leading special events due to the brutal acceleration of the Omicron variant’s spread in Italy.

As a jazzy melody echoes through the air, a spotlight illuminates the top of a staircase, from which the first model descends. Clad in a clinging suit, a clutch bag in her black-gloved hands and a ribbon around her neck, the model saunters into the café room, sashaying elegantly to the beat. Her high heels ring on the glossy mosaic floor as she crosses the room, which is panelled in dark wood to half its height, illuminated by shell-shaped chandeliers and furnished with pedestal tables, velvet sofas and period prints, witness to the dazzling past of the café, opened in 1846.She is followed by a succession of sensual looks, featuring body-hugging, tweed-effect corset dresses, slinky, shiny sheath dresses that lengthen the silhouette, matched with long glitzy gloves, sexy tuxedos worn over satin corsets, evening gowns encrusted with pink crystals, and sequinned mermaid-style dresses that glitter in the night.

Party outfits blend unobtrusively with everyday items, like a maxi trench coat in khaki wool felt, a trouser set in ruby velvet, and a tight-fitting, asymmetric jumpsuit that leaves one arm bare, its fabric featuring a masculine herringbone print.

Plenty of accessories add to the glamour, like the long earrings tasselled with a cascade of pearls, and the black-winged headdress that hints at divinity.
 
Chiara Boni had not shown in Florence since 2015. The label has been showing in New York for a number of years, having focused decidedly on the US market, where it is distributed via leading department store chains, from Hawaii to Chicago. Chiara Boni generates between 75% and 80% of its revenue in the USA, and its other markets are Europe, Russia and the Middle East.Boni is a versatile designer, notably serving as the brains behind avant-garde boutique ‘You Tarzan, Me Jane’ in Florence in the 1970s. She launched her ready-to-wear label La Petite Robe in 2007, adopting a simple, effective approach: creating clothes that are ultra-comfortable and practical, all made with the same type of stretch fabric. The edges are raw, they have no buttons nor zips, and the garments are slipped on from the feet, clinging to the body with incredible ease.

Depending on the models, sometimes Boni combines other materials with this breathable, hypo-allergenic two-way stretch jersey, which is available in various weights and can also replicate the weave of classic fabrics like tweed and wool.

“Times are uncertain, and planning a show in New York was risky, this is why I chose Florence. I wanted to create something beautiful, something that would put a twinkle in people's eyes. We need it right now,” said Boni at the end of the show. She christened her Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection ‘Atelier Paszkowski’, because “this café, which has a special place in my life, always made me think of an atelier,” she added.

“In 2020, because of the pandemic, our revenue fell by 40%. But we have been recovering strongly since early 2021, especially since May. And we are absolutely booming in the USA, where our retailers have again asked me for a summer capsule collection, the fifth in a row,” said Boni, who also operates two stores in Milan and Rome.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 11, 2022","On Friday evening, the French men’s fashion association unveiled the official programme of Paris Fashion Week Men, scheduled on January 18-23. There are no major surprises, except for the withdrawal of two of the new names that were announced before Christmas among this season’s Parisian runway debuts. They are US label Amiri by Californian designer Mike Amiri and VTMNTS, the new line characterised by “understated, sustainable luxury” that was launched in summer by Guram Gvasalia, which both no longer appear on the definitive calendar.This season's Paris Fashion Week Men’s official calendar includes 76 labels, with 17 runway shows and 29 presentations in physical format (altogether, 46 in-person events) and 30 digital shows, as the French Fashion and Haute Couture Federation (FHCM) stated in a press release. FHCM also indicated that the presentation formats chosen by the labels might change “depending on the health situation and the measures introduced by the public authorities.” Notably, Paco Rabanne and Alaïa will present their women's ready-to-wear collections during the menswear week, both on Sunday January 23, respectively at 4.30 pm and 8.30 pm CET.

The fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is surging all over the world at the start of 2022, will once again prevent the world of fashion from going back to staging fashion weeks with in-person events only. Of the Parisian week’s 17 physical runway shows, two will be held on the same day, Thursday January 20 at 2.30 pm and 6.30 pm CET, by Louis Vuitton. Rumour has it that the label's men’s collection set to be unveiled for the occasion will feature the last work by Creative Director Virgil Abloh, who passed away aged 41 on November 28 2021.Among other top luxury names, Dior Men, Hermès, Loewe, Jil Sander, Rick Owens, Ami and Y/Project have also opted to stage a physical show, as well as Kenzo, whose show on Sunday January 23 will be one of the week's highlights, introducing the first collection designed by the label’s new creative director, Nigo, a leading figure in Japanese streetwear.

Of the six new names joining the official Parisian menswear calendar for the first time this season, four will stage in-person shows: young British designer Bianca Saunders, French labels Bluemarble and EgonLab, and Danish brand Rains. The other two rookies, Japanese label Doublet and US label Kidsuper, have chosen to show in digital format.

The situation is evolving rapidly however, as shown by this week's serial cancellations of fashion events that were scheduled in January, and the Parisian calendar might undergo a few more modifications before January 18.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 10, 2022","Designer JW Anderson has called off his planned Milan runway show for next weekend and will instead unveil his next menswear collection digitally. 
The decision is a significant disappointment for Milano Moda Uomo, the key Italian menswear season, which had heralded the arrival of Jonathan Anderson and his hip UK label as an expression of Milan’s pulling power in menswear.
 
“Due to the logistical difficulties and challenging travel situation, caused by the current coronavirus developments, JW Anderson are going to be presenting their FW Men’s collection as a digital show,” the London-based house of Anderson explained in a terse statement.“The show will be premiered on the Camera della Moda channels on Sunday 16 January at 8:00PM CET. JW Anderson remains committed to Milan and will return in June with a physical show to present their Men’s SS23 collection,” the house stressed.
 
The cancellation means that Anderson joins a significant list of runway shows planned for Italy this month that have been called off due to concerns about the omicron variant.
 
Milan’s next menswear season is due to be staged from January 14 to 18; and will follow the three-day menswear fair in Florence.
 
Anderson follows the example of Giorgio Armani, who called off both his Emporio and signature collection menswear shows in Milan, and his haute couture show in Paris later in January.
 
That said, even with the late withdrawals, Milan is currently scheduled to stage 18 runway shows, spread over five days, including such stellar marques as Zegna, Prada, Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, DSquared2 and Etro, as brands stage more intimate shows respecting sanitary restrictions necessitated by the pandemic.
 
Last week, Pitti announced that its banner event in Florence, Ann Demeulemeester, had been rescheduled for the summer. The show had been planned as an interactive retrospective celebrating the Belgian brand’s 40th anniversary.
 
While a key stalwart of Pitti, Brunello Cucinelli had pulled out of the fair, though he will however stage a showroom presentation in Milan.

"Jan 5, 2022","Pierre Cardin will stage a grand runway come-back by holding a major tribute show in honour of its eponymous founder. The show was initially scheduled on December 29 2021, exactly one year after Cardin died, aged 98, on December 29 2020, and has been postponed to January 28, right after Paris Haute Couture Week, which is set to end on January 27.This “exceptional runway show” will be held on “Friday January 28 2022 at 7 pm CET at the Le Bourget Air and Space Museum” outside Paris, as the label announced in a press release. Pierre Cardin picked this unique venue in homage to the renowned couturier’s spectacular shows. The event, “wished for and masterminded by [Cardin’s] nephew Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, now at the head of the group, will feature the style and codes that have made the label's success,” added Pierre Cardin.

The event will showcase the last models created by the eclectic designer, and will also present the new collection by the Pierre Cardin design studio. In a press conference held in March 2021, Rodrigo Basilicati, who has now added ‘Cardin’ to his surname, recalled the long hours he spent with Cardin during the pandemic: “he gave me plenty of ideas. He also left many sketches for new models, which will be developed for our next show. It will be a huge show, a tribute to [Pierre Cardin’s] memory.”Basilicati, Cardin’s spiritual heir, also said that “we can keep the Pierre Cardin ready-to-wear line alive without parroting it, but simply respecting [its heritage], which is very clear, with instantly recognisable products. We want to keep the conversation about [Cardin] going without completely changing the line’s identity, as is done at other labels.” Basilicati himself has taken charge of the label’s augmented design studio.

The show, featuring women’s ready-to-wear looks and also a number of menswear ones, will unveil several hitherto unseen Pierre Cardin creations, as well as new models designed by the label’s studio, inspired by Pierre Cardin’s monumental archives. The latter include nearly 30,000 items and are all held by the group. For the first time, new models created after Pierre Cardin’s death will be presented. It will be a significant first step in enabling the label to promote the continuity of its heritage.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 5, 2022","Despite the rise in covid-19 cases around the world, weddings are expected to pick up again in 2022, bringing with them a new set of bridal fashion trends. In search of extravagance and change, women are turning away from traditional dresses to embrace bolder, sexier styles, sometimes drawing inspiration from hit TV shows.Are mermaid gowns or princess-style wedding dresses still the stuff of dreams? In these uncertain times -- marked by a pandemic that has lasted for nearly two years -- women aspire to change, searching for more daring bridal styles. This is evidenced by a current craze for sexy dresses with suggestive cuts, and even colorful gowns.

As the wedding fair season gets underway, the specialist platform Mariages.net (part of the group that also publishes WeddingWire and Hitched.co.uk) lifts the veil on the major trends that we're likely to see at ceremonies this year. And it's clear that traditional wedding dresses are no longer the order of the day. Coming back in force in ready-to-wear, cutouts will also be seen in wedding attire this year, with dresses cut out on the sides, as well as dresses and skirts with slits or pockets, reflecting a growing interest in sexier cuts and styles.But wedding dresses also seem to be getting more extravagant, with a host of details that bring a touch of fantasy, from feathers to frills through transparent effects. One thing doesn't look set to change, however, is brides' passion for backless cuts -- a must-have that still has a bright future ahead.

The influence of TV shows

Throughout 2021, fashion has been influenced by hit TV shows, starting with those shown by the streaming giant Netflix. Bridal trends are no exception, also seemingly drawing inspiration from certain dramas, including ""Bridgerton,"" which brings pre-Victorian style back to the forefront. As a result, long sleeves will feature among this year's trends, as well as high necks, swan necks, lace, corsets and voluminous skirts, explains Mariages.net.

As for the colors, white and off-white remain the major classics most appreciated by future brides. But in its latest review, Etsy observed a growing interest in patterns and bright colors, again synonymous with this desire to embrace extravagance and boldness. The platform reported a 223% increase in searches for colorful creations for the big day, whether for invitations, table decorations or clothing choices for the bride and groom.

"Jan 4, 2022","Italian fashion house Giorgio Armani said Tuesday it would cancel its upcoming January shows in Milan and Paris due to rising Covid cases in Europe.""This decision was made with great regret and following careful reflection in light of the worsening epidemiological situation,"" said the Milan-based group led by 87-year-old Giorgio Armani.

Armani is the first major Italian fashion label to cancel its upcoming shows this year due to the new wave of infections, as it did at the outset of the pandemic in February 2020, which hit Italy hard.In May last year, Giorgio Armani announced the resumption of fashion shows with live audiences. That followed a year in which the fashion industry relied on ""virtual"" shows -- online presentations of catwalk shows without audiences, or short films publicising the new collections.

The fashion house said the men's Emporio Armani and Giorgio Armani shows for Fall/Winter 2022/23 during Milan Fashion Week this month would not go forward.

Also cancelled is the women's Giorgio Armani Prive women's show during the Paris Haute Couture week from January 24 to 27.

Contacted by AFP, the group said it had no plans for the moment to replace the shows with digital presentations.

Men's Fashion Week in Milan, scheduled from January 14 to 18, had initially planned for 23 physical shows and the participation of 47 brands, including Ermenegildo Zegna, Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana and Prada.

Italy, like other countries around the world, is seeing a sharp rise in cases driven by the new Omicron variant. On Monday, it reported over 68,000 new cases and 140 new Covid-related deaths.

"Dec 22, 2021","Next January's Paris Fashion Week Men will focus more than ever on emerging labels. The French capital may have lost JW Anderson and 1017 Alyx 9SM, which have chosen to show in Milan for the coming season, but its January programme is no less rich and promising, according to the provisional calendar released by the French men’s fashion association. An extensively rejuvenated calendar that features, alongside major names like Dior and Hermès, no fewer than eight new labels on the official show programme (Amiri, Bianca Saunders, Doublet, EgonLab, Kidsuper, Rains, VTMNTS and Bluemarble) and 10 emerging labels on the presentation programme.
 The Paris fashion week scheduled on January 18-23 is dedicated to the menswear collections for the Fall/Winter 2022-23, and will comprise both digital events and physical shows, “in compliance with the measures adopted by the government and the health authorities,” as indicated in a press release by the French Fashion and Haute couture Federation (FHCM), which stated that the definitive calendar will be revealed in early January. Paris Fashion Week Men will feature 77 labels, of which 42 are on the show calendar. Additionally, Paco Rabanne and Alaïa will unveil their women’s ready-to-wear collections on Sunday January 23, respectively at 4.30 pm and 8.30 pm CET. 
 
Notably, Louis Vuitton has scheduled a show on Thursday January 20 at 6.30 pm CET. The LVMH group's leading label has recently lost the creative director of menswear, Virgil Abloh, who passed away on November 28 after a battle with cancer. It is rumoured that the collection that will be unveiled next January might be the final fruit of Abloh’s work.The spotlights during Paris Fashion Week Men will undoubtedly be trained on the eight labels that will be making their maiden appearance on the Parisian runways. None of these labels is an unknown quantity, since some have presented their collections in Paris in previous seasons, while others have caught the eye at the most prestigious young fashion designer competitions. This is the case of British designer Bianca Saunders, 28, winner of the ANDAM Prize 2021 and a finalist at the LVMH Prize this same year, and of US artist/designer Colm Dillane, founder of arty label Kidsuper, who was awarded the Karl Lagerfeld/Special Jury Mention prize on the same occasion. Both Saunders and Dillane founded their labels in 2018.
 
Kidsuper premièred in Paris during the digital fashion weeks of July 2020 and June 2021, and will show for the first time in physical format in January. The same applies to Japanese designer Masayuki Ino, winner of the LVMH Prize in 2018. He set up his own label, Doublet, in 2012, and his creations are steeped in the same playful mood as Dillane’s. In addition to his digital Parisian presence, Ino was also on the fashion week’s physical presentation programme in June 2018.
 
In January the same year, Amiri staged its first, remarkable presentation for the Parisian fashion public. The label, distinctive for its glamorous rocker style, has since boosted its visibility, attracting Italian group OTB, which acquired a minority stake in it, and recently opening a store in New York. Mike Amiri, 44, named menswear designer of 2021 by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, switched to fashion and to designing jeans after initially studying law. He then worked for pop music bands, for which he created special stage costumes, until he launched his own high-end denim label Amiri in Los Angeles in 2014. 
Another directional, international name that is very much on the rise is Rains, the Danish brand of Scandi-style rain gear founded in Aarhus in 2012 by Daniel Brix Hesselager, Philip Lotko Wormslev and Kenneth Davids. Rains is renowned for its chic, lightweight urban apparel made with high-tech materials, and is a real hit on the French market.
 
Two French labels, EgonLab and Bluemarble, will also be making their official debut on the Parisian runways in January. They have both been featured at the Sphère showroom, a project operated by FHCM with the backing of Defi (France’s Committee for the Development and Promotion of Apparel). EgonLab was founded in January 2019 by Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix, and its streetwear-influenced men’s wardrobe is designed to appeal to women too. This year, EgonLab bagged the Pierre Bergé prize for creativity at the ANDAM designer competition, and is one of the finalists for the Woolmark Prize.
 
Bluemarble too has a strong streetwear vibe, and is led by designer Anthony Alvarez, who is half French, half Filipino, and was born in the USA. Bluemarble, as the label is known since 2019, was first launched under the name OneCulture in 2017, each of its collections inspired by a different place or city.
 
Last but not least among the Paris fashion week's eight new names is VTMNTS, the brand-new apparel and accessories line characterised by “understated, sustainable luxury” launched in summer by Guram Gvasalia, who is now in charge of style at Vetements, the uber-popular luxe streetwear label he founded in 2014 with his brother Demna. While Vetements’s Fall/Winter 2022-23 collection was unveiled with a video in November, as anticipated by FashionNetwork.com, VTMNTS will instead stage a physical show in January.
 
The Parisian presentation calendar also features a long list of new entries: Airei (launched in 2020) and Winnie (2018) from the USA, Liberal Youth Ministry (2016) from Mexico, Lukhanyo Mdingi (2015) from South Africa, Namesake (2020) from Taiwan, Solid Homme (1988) and Songzio (1993) from South Korea, Youths in Balaclava (2014) from Singapore, and French brands Steven Passaro (2019) and Vuarnet (1957), the latter an eyewear brand presenting its new apparel line designed by Boramy Viguier.

"Dec 21, 2021","When the pandemic forced fashion weeks around the world to go digital with their runway presentations, the future of physical events was thrown into doubt, with many raising questions about the relevance and media impact of in-person shows. Certainly, there was some truth in the issues highlighted by those who used the opportunity to criticize the often unsustainable excesses of the golden days of the catwalk. However, there were also those who fervently defended physical shows as events imbued with an added value that would be difficult to substitute. Somewhere in between these two camps arose multidisciplinary creative platform ""Kyiv Art & Fashion Days,"" an initiative that blends culture, fashion and emerging talent, all while shining a spotlight on the art scene of a charming capital city about which many in the industry are still woefully ignorant. ""This platform venture is essential for this kind of country. Designers from Ukraine and Georgia look to Paris and Milan, cities that are very saturated with offers,"" explained the founder of the creative project, Sofia Tchkonia. For the entrepreneur, who is also head of MBFW Tbilisi, ""we have to leave this mentality behind,"" so as to create spaces on ""alternative scenes"" that don't suffer from the same pressures as cities with more consolidated reputations in the global fashion industry, scenes that can generate movements and energies that are more daring and alternative. 

""We have to make people come to these places, discover the local scene and get closer to the creativity of its designers. These talents must be discovered and we have to support them so that they can find a way to present themselves to the world,"" said Tchkonia, who, following ""the success"" of its debut, intends to expand the project in its second edition next year.From emerging capitals to experiential eventsThis idea of searching for new hubs for the sector was also touched on by filmmaker and creative director of the ""Liberatum"" cultural platform, Tomas Auskas, during a conference organized at Kyiv's impressive Tsum department store, where he highlighted the potential of ""the vivacity of cities that are currently less developed as fashion capitals,"" such as Kyiv, Tbilisi and Mexico City.

Further to this, in light of the effects of the pandemic, designer and associate professor at Parsons School of Design, Keanan Duffy, pointed out that the crisis could be an ""opportunity to rethink"" the way in which the industry is run and understood. ""Success in fashion still seems to be linked with scaling and selling more products, but, in my experience, artistic collaboration and not being afraid of failure are totally fundamental,"" he added, emphasizing the value of creativity as a positive response to times of change.Although Vena Brykalin, fashion editor of Vogue Ukraine, believes that the challenges facing local design are considerable and that Paris, Milan, London and New York will maintain their privileged status as fashion capitals, she insisted on the importance of change after the pandemic. ""The big brands will continue to organize immense shows, but emerging labels shouldn't compete in this environment, for questions of budget. They should look for alternatives, either via digital formats or events in emerging cities,"" she argued. 

This niche market of emerging fashion capitals has become Tchkonia's specialty, and her success lies in concentrating talent, developing synergies and creating appealing partnerships with the tourist operations, gastronomy and history of these cities that are less known to the media. The idea is not to create small, peripheral fashion weeks, but to launch platforms for experiences and interactions capable of stirring up curiosity and interest. The magnetism of Kyiv""Kyiv is a magnetic city. It attracts creative people and unites their energy into a single, powerful current,"" mused Georgian designer Lasha Mdinaradze, who is more than familiar with the breath of fresh air that blows through the city's art scene. His love story with the Ukrainian capital, its golden domes and its architectural relics of the Soviet era dates back to 2015, when he chose the city as the base for his brand, Gudu.

His label is characterized by empowered tailoring that brings together references to art and music. Its collection for Spring/Summer 2022 was presented at the historical museum dedicated to the work of Ukrainian humanist Taras Shevchenko, a location that could have been merely anecdotal had it not been for the fact that it established a series of stimulating contrasts that set the tone for the event.

At Gudu, irreverent designs featuring logos reinterpreting the Bolnisi Cross were blended with flashes of nocturnal moodiness that made inevitable references to the city's mysterious fashion club, known only by the name of the street it is located on: Kyrylivska. An heir to Berlin's Berghain, the establishment reflects the enthusiastic and cosmopolitan creative scene of emerging Kyiv. ""This event speaks about how art collaborates with fashion and vice versa. It is a great opportunity to bring together different artists in a single platform,"" added Mdinaradze.

Elsewhere, the Georgian designer's compatriot, Irakli Rusadze, founder of minimalist brand Situationist, also made reference to his homeland with the presentation of his Fall/Winter 2021 collection at Tsum, which featured hand-woven accessories and paid tribute to the traditions of the mountainous region of Svanetia.Lake Studio, a nature-inspired brand led by the duo of Anastasia Riabokon and Olesya Kononova, presented its own multidisciplinary fusion in the Suzir'ya theater, where it hosted a see-now-buy-now show. The star attraction of this event was a performance from the Dakh Daughters collective, which mixes dialects and instruments with reflections about female identity.

""Our brand is a symbiosis between culture, contemporary art and intellectual fashion,"" said the designers of their rhythmic and vibrantly folkloric show, explaining that several of their collections are collaborations with artists, illustrators and jewelers. ""Our main motivation for taking part in this event was supporting an unprecedented initiative and calling the attention of the public to contemporary art,"" continued the pair, emphasizing the ""educational principle"" that their brand has always cherished.

This objective corresponds with that of Avangarden Gallery, where an exhibition fused together traditional Ukrainian music with a dialogue between textile artist specialized in graphical tapestries, Oksana Levchenya, and artisanal brand Guina Project. ""By bringing together artists under the same banner, we want to show the modern Ukraine, which is stylish and a little daring, which honors traditions while also challenging them. The Ukrainian aesthetic is always fresh and relevant, despite having its origins in the past,"" theorized the organizers of the exhibition, which examined the contrast between folklore and the vanguard which informed all of the pieces on display.

This perspective is also shared by traditional tailoring brand Litkovskaya, which mixes designs for modern women with traditional elements passed down through four generations of tailors. Its founder, Lilia, is also the creator of a line that reclaims ancestral carpet-making techniques in order to produce unique coats and jackets, a project that aims to preserve the crafts of the Carpathian Mountains and create jobs for women in the region.Among the poppier offerings, stand-outs include Frolov, a couture-to-wear brand that has won over A-list fans with its corsetry and artisanal embroidery, as well as Valery Kovalska, a designer who founded her namesake brand in 2010. Responsible for looks sported by Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Charlene of Monaco, the independent designer specialized in modern tuxedos and seductive dresses is one of the most internationally renowned figures of the young Ukrainian fashion scene.

""The brand became famous abroad first, which helped develop the business on the local market,"" explained Kovalska during a tour of her showroom. In particular, she highlighted the brand's strong sales in the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates, two markets which are mentioned over and over again when local designers discuss their major buyers. The post-Soviet vanguardAvant-garde and politically-engaged fashion was represented by Georgian art and fashion collective The Fungus, which hosted a performance piece that played with the limits of mainstream fashion. ""Clothing is one of the most significant elements of human self-expression. In patriarchal, traditional and often discriminatory countries, clothes become a form of protest and take on the meaning of armor."" This was the message explored by the collective in its works, which criticized the industry's ""exercise in discreditation."" ""Fashion takes inspiration from queer and underground cultures and subcultures, but often limits itself to taking the form without its context, so that the main content of queer culture is silenced,"" said the group. Counterculture also made its presence felt in Hrishnytsia, a new art fanzine launched by photographer Julie Poley. Aiming to subvert pre-established ideas, the artist, an important figure in the new wave of Ukrainian feminism, chose to organize an irreverent presentation at Star Rhino, one of Kyiv's most emblematic strip clubs. Instead of women performing for the male gaze, however, the club's stage was overrun with liberated drag queens, tattoo artists and sporty dancers, all of whom infused the space with a new meaning. Here again, Kyiv's cultural scene showed how it intends to reply to conservatism and the oppression of women and other minorities: with liberation and innovation. 

Now, with the renewed threat of Russian military deployment following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian talent has an even greater challenge to address: continuing to grow despite the turbulent political situation. The necessary guts and fighting spirit are in no short supply. Quite the contrary, they seem to be at the root of this bubbling artistic scene's captivating personality.

"Dec 20, 2021","In September, Pyer Moss founder Kerby Jean-Raymond and French luxury giant Kering announced that they had teamed up to launch talent incubator Your Friends in New York (YFINY). Now, three months later, Jean-Raymond has revealed further details about how the platform is seeking to support and elevate the next generation of designers of color. 
At its core, YFINY functions as an accelerator and support system, helping brands with everything from financing to production and planning, and even psychological and emotional support. Since starting, it has concentrated on supporting brands with infrastructure, leading them through processes such as trademark protection and accounting.
 
“With Black people, there can only be one of us. And when there’s two of us or three of us, they pit us against each other. That’s a real thing,” Jean-Raymond told The New York Times, explaining the thinking behind the foundation of YFINY. “Now, every Black designer who comes out with a bag is compared to Telfar.”In reaction to this situation, the incubator conceived by the designer alongside Kering also emphasizes collaboration, with participating brands sharing information and experiences with each other, as well as with Jean-Raymond’s own Pyer Moss label.
 
Over the course of the last year, eight designers have been working within this structure, all of whom were picked by Jean-Raymond himself. They include Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Anifa Myuemba of Hanifa, Taofeek Abijako of Head of State, Raul Lopez of Luar, Nigella Miller of AFRA, Geron McKinley of GIM Brand, and Johnny Nelson of Johnny Nelson Jewelry.
 
YFINY has no financial stake in these brands, but the venture is meant to be beneficial for all involved. Jean-Raymond, for example, also stands to gain from the support system that he has created, while partner Kering gets a first look at promising new talents. E-commerce platform Ssense, which has committed to promoting and sharing data with YFINY, as well as to making an annual buy from the structure, is providing valuable support to the initiative, but has also placed itself at the front of the queue when it comes to commercializing the resulting collections.
 
According to The New York Times, YFINY had initially intended to host an annual festival, featuring fashion, music and wellness. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has since stalled these plans, but there are still hopes at the company that such an event could still come together.
 
Other plans for the future include Jean-Raymond’s desire to purchase a home base for the company, a location that could host shared sampling facilities, as well as pop-ups selling products from participating brands and YFINY merchandise.
 
In the longer term, Kethlyn White, senior director of YFINY, sees the concept expanding internationally, alluding to the idea of “Your Friends in…” chapters springing up in locations such as Los Angeles, London or even Hong Kong.
 
For now, though, YFINY’s focus is on helping its “class of 2022” to grow. “If I can get all these brands to 30K a month in direct-to-consumer revenue, and then 60K and then 100K, then they are $1 million businesses, and that’s proof of concept and self-sustaining,” explained Jean-Raymond.
 
“Right now we’re doing it for the love of each other, but at some part it becomes very beneficial,” he concluded. “We can get to success a lot faster together than apart.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 16, 2021","The provisional line-up for London Fashion Week that runs from 18 to 22 February has been released with details of which labels will show physically and which will unveil their collections digitally at the hybrid event.The line-up includes labels such as Asai, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Conner Ives, Feben, Halpern, Labrum London and Matty Bovan.

"Dec 15, 2021","Italian shoemaker Francesco Russo and French designer Charles de Vilmorin have teamed up for an exclusive collaboration. 
The duo will create a capsule of five shoe styles, which will be available on Francesco Russo’s website and at a selection of wholesales starting April-May 2022.
 
Each pair will incorporate hand-painted images by Charles de Vilmorin, printed on leather. With the end goal of blending the rich graphic imagination of de Vilmorin and the ergonomic zest of Francesco Russo, the most exciting new shoemaker in the boot of Italy.Russo launched his eponymous label in September 2013, after 20 years designing for brands including Miu Miu, Yves Saint Laurent, Sergio Rossi and Dior.
 
A graduate of La Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne in July 2019, Charles de Vilmorin exploded onto the Paris scene with his phantasmagorical sketches and dramatic debut collection that year. In the wake of that break-out fashion moment, de Vilmorin was appointed creative director of Rochas in February 2021.
 
Their collection will include Russo’s icons from his knee-high boot and loafer to three stiletto styles, captured in an ad campaign shot by de Vilmorin himself. The capsule marks the latest link-up between the pair, since de Vilmorin hand painted over Russo shoes for his Spring 2021 couture show. 
“Since launching his eponymous line in 2020 I’ve always been amazed by the imaginary of Charles and all his drawings. Seeing my classical silhouette as canvas for his creativity is a great gift,” said Russo in a release.
 
“For this collection, I hand-painted colors and patterns directly onto the shoes, in a way that felt very instinctive. What's especially interesting is the coming together of Francesco Russo's traditional savoir-faire and the instinctive, playful way that I approach design. These pieces are elegant, seductive, creative and colorful,” added de Vilmorin.
 
Pricing will range from 595 euros for stilettos to 1,500 euros for knee-high boots.

"Dec 15, 2021","Just two weeks after the death of Virgil Abloh, who passed away after a battle with cancer on November 28, rumors already abound about who will succeed the American designer at Louis Vuitton. Quickest on the draw, the British press has indicated rapper and close friend of Abloh, Kanye West, as his potential heir at the head of the brand's menswear collections.
 The speculative information was first published by The Sun, a tabloid better known for its scandal pieces than its coverage of the fashion industry, which claims that ""the pair are said to have masterminded the move […] before Virgil’s death aged just 41."" The newspaper further highlighted the strong friendship between Abloh and West, who met in 2009, when they were both undertaking fashion training at Fendi, another brand owned by French luxury conglomerate and Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH. 
 
In the same year, West collaborated with Louis Vuitton on three sneaker designs, which proved to be wildly popular, breaking the barriers between streetwear and luxury fashion for the first time. Subsequently, the rapper and producer saw success with the launch of his own high-end streetwear label, Yeezy, in 2015. However, West, who suffers from bipolar disorder, has something of a reputation for unpredictability, a quality which would seem to undermine the viability of any candidate for the role of creative director at an LVMH house, especially at Louis Vuitton, the group's historic flagship. 

Another factor unlikely to count in West's favor is the fact that, this summer, he looked to be cozying up to LVMH's major competitor, Kering. The rapper was seen at the runways of Kering-owned Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, and, perhaps most notably of all, entrusted the creative direction of the event celebrating the launch of his latest album, Donda, to Balenciaga designer Demna Gvasalia. 

If the appointment of West at Louis Vuitton seems doubtful, LVMH must nonetheless tackle the issue of this difficult succession quickly. What's more, the luxury group led by Bernard Arnault will not only have to find a successor for Abloh at the head of Louis Vuitton's menswear collections, but will also need to find someone to lead the designer's own brand, Off-White, in which LVMH acquired a 60% stake in July. In both cases, the most likely scenario would seem to be the appointment of an in-house designer as a temporary solution. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 14, 2021","The programme for the next edition of Milan Fashion Week Men, scheduled on January 14-18, will be brief but intense. The fashion week will focus on the menswear collections for the Fall/Winter 2022-23, and will include a number of physical shows - 23, as opposed to three in June - and no fewer than eight major soirees. Above all, there is a breath of fresh air about this fashion week, despite lingering uncertainties about the pandemic. There will be six new names on the calendar, including three of the edgiest labels in contemporary fashion - JW Anderson, 1017 Alyx 9SM and 44 Label Group - and three intriguing emerging labels: Federico Cina, JordanLuca and Justin Gall.“[JW Anderson, 1017 Alyx 9SM and 44 Label Group] are well-established young labels, while the three other new names are extremely influential on the fashion scene right now,” said Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) President Carlo Capasa, speaking at the press conference held on Monday for the calendar’s presentation. As was announced last month, talented British designer Jonathan Anderson, currently the creative director of LVMH-owned Spanish luxe label Loewe, has dropped out of the Paris calendar, and will unveil his own label’s new collection in Milan on the evening of Sunday January 16.

On Friday January 14, another rising Parisian runway star will be opening Milan Fashion Week: US designer Matthew Williams, also the creative director of Givenchy, the French label owned by LVMH. Williams will show in Milan the men’s and women’s collections for his own label, 1017 Alyx 9SM, launched in 2015 and renowned for its sophisticated contemporary style. As Capasa said, “Matthew founded his label in New York, but its headquarters are in the Italian city of Ferrara,” where Williams set up his atelier in 2017, to be closer to his producers and suppliers.Also showing on Friday 14 is 44 Label Group, the latest gem unearthed by Claudio Antonioli, who played an early part in Off-White’s success. The luxury streetwear label, which will be unveiling its first collection, was launched by Claudio, the owner of Milanese multibrand retailer Antonioli, in collaboration with Max Kosobil, a renowned Berlin-based techno DJ and producer.

As for Federico Cina, JordanLuca and Justin Gall, they are no longer unknown quantities. Cina launched his own label in 2019, and in the same year he won the Who Is On Next? emerging designer competition. He joined Milan’s digital calendar in 2020, and this year he was a semi-finalist at the prestigious LVMH Prize. Justin Gall has caught the eye on Milan Fashion Week's digital showcase, on which he debuted in 2020. The US designer founded his outerwear brand, with a futuristic warrior aesthetic, in Rome in 2014, with Chiara Nardelli.

JordanLuca is a small, emerging menswear label that has so far showed in London. It notably gained visibility after being picked by Gucci for its video festival last year, and this year it was selected among the labels distributed on the Kering group's leading label's e-concept store, Gucci Vault. JordanLuca was launched in 2018 by Italian designer Luca Marchetto and British milliner Jordan Bowen, its distinctive street couture vibe blending London street culture with Italian tailoring and finishings. 
 Alongside these new labels, all the top names in Italian fashion, from Zegna to Armani, Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Prada and Dsquared2, will be showing in Milan as usual. Notably, CNMI decided to concentrate all physical shows and events in the fashion week’s first four days, from January 14 to 17, while the last day, Tuesday 18, will be dedicated to digital shows, among them those by A-Cold-Wall, Children of the Discordance and Serdar. The following labels will be joining the Milanese physical presentation calendar for the first time: Ardusse, Çanaku, Family First, Dhruv Kapoor and Jet Set.
 
CNMI is optimistic about the fashion week, and also announced a number of gala evenings and parallel events, such as the after-shows by 1017 Alyx 9SM and 44 Label Group, the anniversary party by C.P. Company, and the concert organised by Gucci with Australian electropop band Parcels. “Everything will be organised in full compliance with existing health regulations in terms of venue capacity and ventilation systems, while mask-wearing will be mandatory and access will be possible only by showing the so-called Super Green Pass [vaccination certification],” said Capasa. “The vaccination drive is in full flow in Italy. After reaching its peak, the number of Covid cases is expected to decrease, and this gives us confidence,” concluded Capasa.
 
In total, 47 labels will take part in this edition of Milan Fashion Week Men, with 68 events on the programme. One of the most eagerly awaited events is the eighth edition of Fashion Film Festival Milano, whose jury will be chaired by the Creative Director of Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli. The festival will showcase 260 films from 60 countries, and will close with the screening of a documentary entitled ‘Elio Fiorucci - free spirit’. Also on the programme, the first feature film by John Galliano, co-directed with Olivier Dahan, entitled ‘A Folk Horror Tale’.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 14, 2021","Diesel is set to hit the runway in Milan next February. Up until 2018, the brand hosted shows in the Lombard capital for its premium Diesel Black Gold line, but now it's the turn of the company's core denim label to step into the spotlight. The move comes as the next logical step following the appointment of avant-garde Belgian designer Glenn Martens, who also shows his collections for Y/Project in Paris, as the brand's creative director last year.
  
In a press release, the star brand in Renzo Rosso's portfolio said that it ""is proud to announce its official listing on the Milan Fashion Week (womenswear) calendar for the Fall/Winter 2022 show season,"" further specifying that ""this marks Diesel's first time formally participating in MFW’s womenswear segment."" The show will open the fashion week, at 1PM on Wednesday, February 23, and will reveal the second women's and menswear collection designed by Martens for the jeans maker. Diesel will also show its Spring/Summer 2023 collection in Milan in September.

This is all good news for the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), which has seen its fashion week shrink considerably over the last few years, due to the growth in popularity of coed shows and the desire of some of the most emblematic Italian houses to break free from the fashion calendar during the pandemic. Diesel is not, however, the only brand to have decided to show in Milan next season. Several other big names have already announced their return to the Lombard capital in February, including Gucci and Bottega Veneta. As for DSquared2, which had taken to presenting both its men's and womenswear during the menswear fashion weeks in January and June, the brand has decided to abandon this strategy and go back to showing its collections separately. In a recent interview, the label's designers, Dean and Dan Caten, revealed that they believed their womenswear collection had lost visibility by being presented upstream of women's fashion week. In line with this belief, they will unveil their collections for next winter with two shows, one for menswear in January and another for womenswear in February. 
 
In other news, CNMI has teamed up with Valentino for a partnership that will spotlight a young Italian designer through the Rome-based fashion house's social media channels every season, with a particular focus on Instagram. The collaboration kicks off in February, with Marco Rambaldi having been selected as the first guest designer. 
 Finally, CNMI president Carlo Capasa has announced a new parallel project that aims to increase synergies during Milan Fashion Week. The project takes the form of a partnership between the Italian fashion organization, research platform White and Confartigianato Imprese, the employer association bringing together Italy's artisan businesses, with the support of ICE, the Italian agency that promotes Italian companies abroad and supports their international development. 

The partnership's objective is to coordinate initiatives and services in order to attract the largest possible number of international buyers to Italy. Through the collaborative program, more than 1,200 top buyers will be selected and invited to Milan during next February's fashion week, with Capasa explaining that chosen companies will be offered a range of services to facilitate their work.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Dec 10, 2021","Kim Jones returned to his hometown on Thursday with a Dior Men counter-culture couture collection inspired by Jack Kerouac’s key novel 'On the Road', and feted by Grace Jones.The bible of the Beat Generation, a term Kerouac actually invented, On the Road has been inspiring youths for over a half-century to search out their own individual zeitgeist.  And his high-speed, jazzy prose was the well-spring for another smart, original and very likely influential collection for the house of Dior.
 
For fall 2022, a blend of college-kid Americana with a large dollop of French finesse, leavened with a dash of London street-style. Staged inside the giant glass-roofed Olympia show space, the show also marked Jones' first catwalk event in London since 2003.At first sight, the restless boozy bohemia of Kerouac and the pampered haute bourgeois youth of Christian Dior seem universes apart. But in Jones’ hands, the tandem managed to be symbiotic and mutually reinforcing and very cool.
 
“Kerouac actually wrote On the Road at precisely the same time, as Christian Dior was revolutionizing fashion and shocking people. So, it is kind of nice that this outsider perspective became so important with the Beat Movement. I found that very interesting that this was happening parallel to the evolution of the Christian Dior house,” Jones told FashionNetwork.com, in a pre-show preview. 
 
Of French-Breton origin, Kerouac actually published his magnum opus in 1957, the same year that Dior died of a heart attack. Christian was patrician-born, yet he opened his own art gallery and immersed himself in the company of artists all his life. Kerouac’s dad’s family were potato farmers, but his talent led him to spend his life among the great Beat writers of his day – like Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso – and the great jazz musicians of that era – Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie.
 
Kerouac famously wrote the 250-page On the Road in 20 days, as his wife supplied him with Benzedrine, cigarettes, coffee and pea soup. Taping together strips of tracing paper so he could indulge in his speed writing sessions. Jones paid homage to that with a giant catwalk made of an exact copy of the book’s original draft, a huge roller unfurling the text.
 Over which walked the first model – in a perfectly cut blazer; khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt covered with a marvelous collage of Kerouac book covers and mock Dior LPs. Like half the looks in the show, the dudes wore striped socks and urban hiking boots.  He was followed by a hipster beatnik topped by a chunky Rasta beanie, purple sweater and brilliantly deconstructed trench, made into a sporty gilet and frock coat at the back.
 
Very much clothes for men on the move, intrepid explorers in stripped knits, pants cut-off at the ankles, club blazers and excellent two-tone shearling bombers. Covers from other novels like 'Big Sur' also appeared as prints mixed in with ideas from the Dior archive. A great hand-painted leather jacket starred the dust jacket of 'Visions of Cody'. The newer silhouette made often of Japanese denim, paired with photos of Kerouac in San Francisco. 
 
All manner of American tailoring, and William Burroughs suit jackets with a bias cut, “which is very Dior,” smiled Jones, dressed collegially in a Balenciaga sweatshirt and Prada logo beanie. 
 
“It’s as if you had a big suitcase when you went on your road-trip,” added the designer, the proud owner of an extensive collection of Kerouac first-editions; letters from the author to his mum depicting how he was going to write On the Road, and one from mum-to-son congratulating him on writing the path-breaking novel.
 
All these were displayed in an substantial installation in the Olympia, enjoyed by VIPs and scores of students from St Martins, Jones old alma mater.“I thought it would be nice for them to see how you come with an idea for a collection and take it somewhere,” explained Jones.
 
“Many of the models in the show had actually read On the Road before they came in for casting. So, its influence still lives on. Plus, during the lockdown you dream of travel,” noted Jones, who read the book in his late teens, and like Kerouac undertook several road-trips across America.
 
“I’d quite like to be on one now!” laughed Jones, who worked with the Kerouac Foundation on this collection.


The night before, Dior hosted a party at 14 Cavendish, a beautiful Georgian mansion, which was a delightful shambles inside – all very Beat Generation with mid-century furniture; a wall of Beatnik news clippings; retro cocktails; live jazz band, and upstairs DJ Paul Doherty spinning Blue Note LPs. An ideal scene setter courtesy of ace event producer, Robin Scott Lawson.
 
Post-show on Thursday, over 1,000 guests enjoyed classic American cocktails like Old Fashioneds and Whisky Sours, and a driving DJ set from Princess Julia. Before the lights dimmed again and Grace Jones performed to an ecstatic reaction from the crowd.
 
The noise level reaching its highest pitch at another example of French and American culture meeting, 'La Vie en Rose'. The signature song of Edith Piaf, it has been recorded by seven American singers, from Bing Crosby to Louis Armstrong.

"Dec 9, 2021","After ""Cultissimes Sneakers"" in 2020, the French sneakerhead and YouTuber Tonton Gibs shares his passion for urban fashion in a new book called ""Street Style.""

In it, he traces the evolution of a style that has gone from the street to the catwalks of the biggest luxury labels in the space of just four decades. The book delves into the origins of streetwear, its different styles around the world, and looks at the key figures of urban fashion. ETX Studio caught up with Tonton Gibs to find out more.After sneakers, you're now tackling street style in a broader sense. What motivated you to write this book?
It's simply a complement to the book about sneakers. One inevitably goes with the other, so it was a logical continuation. The package is now complete.

To whom or what can we attribute the emergence of street style in the '80s?
It's mainly down to hip-hop, B-Boys, the street dancers in New York, but it's also directly related to brands. It really started with the band Run-DMC and the famous million dollar deal with Adidas. It was the first time that a brand signed artists, not athletes. We went from sportswear to lifestyle. People were walking around in tracksuits and sneakers, whereas before these were clothes only worn by sportspeople.  You talk about B-Boy style and the East Coast and West Coast styles in the United States. Then, when it comes to France, you talk about the 'caillera' style associated with troublemakers from the country's tough neighborhoods. Does that mean that street style was frowned upon there?
Urban fashion comes essentially from the working class neighborhoods, whether in France or in the United States. And the baggy pants of New York are in a way the Lacoste tracksuits of France, even if a lot of French people also dressed in baggy pants because they followed the American wave. So I see the parallel more in that way. But for me, it's not seen negatively at all. I allow myself to use this term because I knew this era, I also come from those neighborhoods, and I precisely had this slightly 'caillera' phase. It's a word that doesn't bother me, it's normal. Today, the 'caillera' style has become a fully-fledged retro style. There was a time when most people thought it was awful, and nowadays, when you see someone in the street wearing a tracksuit and a pair of TNs, you think it's a legit retro style. It's kind of funny to see how things have evolved, and to think that even the 'caillera' style left its mark on its time.

How did we go, in 40 years, from a style with pejorative connotations to a style that people now can't get enough of, even on Fashion Week runways?
At the time, there were niches, you had to read the specialist press, follow the American clothing catalogs, etc. to call yourself a connoisseur. The arrival of social networks has turned everything upside down because today, everyone, in the four corners of the globe, has access to absolutely everything, visually. We see all the styles of all the countries, we can follow people everywhere in the world, and so we have something more heterogeneous. There are no more borders, no more limits, and that's what I like: the freedom of urban fashion, extending even to the catwalks of the greatest fashion designers.

You wrote a whole chapter on Kanye West. How is he a key figure of street style?
All the greatest have worked either with him or for him at one time or another. So Kanye West is inevitably a key figure in urban fashion. You can say whatever you want about him, but you can't take away everything he's done, everything he's revolutionized, starting with his very first collaboration with Louis Vuitton. He really brought something to the table, which other big names, like Virgil Abloh, went on to multiply tenfold.

Did this also help raise the status of the codes of the street?
Yes, completely. He brought streetwear to the luxury scene. In my opinion, all the brands we know today -- Off-White, Palm Angels, Fear of God, Jerry Lorenzo -- are the result of what Kanye West did back then.

Jogging suits, sneakers, hoodies, and even the bucket hat are more than ever at the height of fashion. Is urban fashion the style of the moment?
I think fashion has become urban fashion. On the street, 90% of people wear sneakers, even some big [corporate] bosses... I think there is a mix of genres, of styles, today. Many brands are inspired by street style.

It seems like the upper echelons are seeking to appropriate the codes of the street, while the masses swear by Gucci and Balenciaga, for example. How do you explain this paradox?
On the street, this is not necessarily a new phenomenon. Back in the day, rappers already used to put themselves out there with expensive pieces, whether it was Gucci tracksuits or gold chains. But it's true that today, everything is reversed. It has become normal, I could even say sadly normal, to spend €3,000 on a jacket to have an item of clothing that is cool. But there is also the whole approach towards resale that has changed over the years. I see this a lot in my YouTube videos. At one time, I was talking about the resale of sneakers, and people were like: ""but who are these guys who pay €100 for a pair of sneakers and resell them for €1,000 euros?"" Whereas, nowadays, it has become normal. I think there's also this approach towards money that has changed.

Besides Kanye West, who are your street style icons?
There are so many. A lot of current creative directors like Matthew Williams, Jerry Lorenzo... I don't have all the names in my head, but there are loads of them, actually. And then there are a lot of cool brands. I really like Sacai by Chitose Abe and White Mountaineering. I also really like the Japanese way of mixing streetwear and cutting-edge fashion. There are a lot of people who are really good at what they're doing today.

What is the perfect outfit to nail street style?
I don't necessarily have a perfect outfit, because what I like about urban fashion is the freedom to have several styles. I like to dress differently from one day to the next, by turns very on-trend, very 'caillera' or very hip-hop. I like to mix things up. What is good with fashion is to be able to have fun.

And, on the contrary, is there a fashion faux pas to avoid?
It's very free, so I wouldn't talk about any fashion faux pas. At most, in my eyes, there are brands that you don't mix. It's nothing serious, but putting an Adidas tracksuit with a pair of Nikes is like putting Olympique de Marseille shorts with a Paris Saint-Germain shirt, it doesn't make sense.

"Dec 9, 2021","Twenty models with disabilities have taken to the catwalk in Ivory Coast in a ground-breaking assault on taboo and stigma.Decked out in a red suit, traditional Sahelian boubou robes, multi-coloured African bogolan prints and a blue tunic with printed motifs, the models showed off the latest creations of Abidjan designers in an event dubbed ""Strong and Beautiful Together.""

Grace Beho had her right forearm amputated after a road accident.Six months ago, she created the Mougnan Foundation, an organisation set up to improve the quality of life for disabled Ivorian women. Its name means ""moving forward despite difficulties"" in the Guere language of western Ivory Coast.

""I think that the women who are going to be watching us and who do not yet have confidence in themselves... are going to assert themselves and show themselves to the world as they are,"" she said as she stepped off the stage.

Leslie Antsere, who suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disease which can cause disfiguring tumours, said she was delighted to take part in an event that had stopped her from ""feeling ashamed.""

The MC at the fashion show, Nelly Aka, was sporting high heels despite a foot disability.

""Even in a situation of disability, we can go beyond ourselves and do many things,"" she said.

""Overcoming disability is about accepting yourself -- the way people look at you and criticise you will not affect who you are,"" she said.

A model called Sylvia, dressed in a green-and-white dress, opened the show, coming down the catwalk on crutches by the side of a swimming pool in front of an enthusiastic audience in a hotel in the Ivorian economic capital.

The event took place on December 3 -- the UN's International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

- 'Marginalised' -

Officially, Ivory Coast has 453,000 people who are disabled in some way, two percent of the population. For them such an event is unheard of.

""Even mentioning a disabled person in the world of beauty is taboo in Ivory Coast,"" said Ange Prisca Gnagbo, one of organisers for the special evening.

""They are sidelined in all the beauty shows,"" she added.

But such practices are entrenched in Ivory Coast, where disabilities are often viewed -- as elsewhere in Africa -- as an affliction.

""Many disabled women are very vulnerable, rejected and marginalised. So they hide away for fear of being judged,"" said sociologist Yves Ouya.

For Dr Abdoudramane Coulibaly, consultant at the World Health Organization and head of a disability NGO, the issue also faces a lack of political will.

""Let's suggest to able-bodied people that they walk with crutches for a day -- (that way) we will be gain more understanding than with big speeches,"" he suggested.

""My dream is that in the coming decades I will see a handicapped person making a name for himself or herself in areas where the doors have been closed,"" said Beho.Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Dec 9, 2021","The British Fashion Council (BFC) has announced the dates for London Fashion Week 2022 and reconfirmed that the January menswear edition won’t be happening.LFW, which continues to be sponsored by Clearpay will happen on February 18-22 and September 16-20 (both Friday to Tuesday), with what would normally have been the revived men’s event planned to run from June 11-13 (Saturday to Monday). However, this year, all three LFWs will combine both women’s and menswear.

The BFC said the January edition has been cancelled “due to uncertainties arising from Covid-19” and given the move to extra ‘Plan B’ Covid restrictions just announced for England, that earlier decision seems to make good sense.During the height of the pandemic in 2020, LFW went digital but it moved to a hybrid digital-physical schedule this September. The February event is also expected to be a hybrid one. It will continue to incorporate catwalk shows, presentations, appointments, and events throughout London, as well as digital content on the fashion week’s website.

"Dec 9, 2021","The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) announced on Wednesday the launch of the Social Justice Center (SJC) at FIT, a first-of-its-kind higher education initiative, supported by founding partners PVH Corp., Capri Holdings Limited, and Tapestry.The fashion conglomerates, through their respective foundations, have each committed $1 million to help launch the center created to increase opportunity and accelerate social equity within the creative industries for the Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) community. The first-of-its-kind initiative will provide mentorship, education, and career support.

Other industry leaders who have pledged support, include Carolina Herrera, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Saks, Target, and The Fragrance Foundation. Likewise, G-III Apparel Group, made the establishing gift to the SJC Scholarship Fund, which already has reached more than $1.5 million in contributions. The SJC at FIT will nurture a racially and ethnically diverse talent pipeline to assure BIPOC professionals achieve their full potential. It will provide scholarships for middle school, high school, and college students. Once the students are in college, pathways to advancement will be offered through internships, mentorships, and apprenticeships provided by SJC partners.

Numerous scholarships are already available, including the Social Justice Center Endowed Scholarship, the Amsale Aspire Initiative, the Art Smith Memorial Endowed Scholarship, the Black Student Illustrators Graduation Award, and the Prada Scholarship at FIT, among others.

To get there, its approach will equally be supported by four pillars: collaboration among leading corporate and nonprofit CEOs; access to the talent, creativity, and expertise of FIT faculty and students as resources; a sustained commitment to funding support for scholarships and programs; and ongoing accountability that will identify and measure the advancement of BIPOC professionals. 

Jeffrey Tweedy, former president and CEO of Sean John and an FIT alumnus, will be a special advisor to the FIT president to help build and expand the center. Moreover, an industry advisory council of 16 executives has been established to counsel, collaborate, and help measure progress in achieving equity within the creative industries. 

""A powerful and much overdue dialogue was sparked last year around diversity and inclusion, which led to a sobering realization that there was much work to do within the creative industries and at FIT as well. Since then, we have been building a strong foundation for the Social Justice Center at FIT,” said FIT president, Joyce F. Brown.  

“I am grateful for the early support from PVH, Capri Holdings, Tapestry, G-III Apparel Group, and FIT's other charter partners. They have demonstrated a formidable commitment to these efforts, and I am confident that the center is poised to effect meaningful change.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 8, 2021","It seems that fashion will be shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic once again in 2022. At least that's what Pinterest, the American website specialized in sharing inspiration and practical tips, reports in its latest annual study, ""Pinterest Predicts,"" which highlights trends for the coming year. Based on the analysis of the searches of 400 million users around the world in the platform's most popular categories, including home, fashion, beauty, education, travel and wellbeing, the report outlines a number of trends set to define next year, with many reflecting the unique context of the pandemic. Indeed, according to Pinterest, 2022 will continue to be marked by the health crisis and post-lockdown trends. 

The gloom of the pandemic, for example, is generating strong user demand for colorful clothes, as shown by the increase in searches for terms such as ""rainbow dress women,"" which have doubled, ""fuschia dress outfit,"" which have quadrupled, and ""electric blue outfit,"" up 140%.After several months spent at home, the platform's users have also been showing more interest in clothes to be worn indoors, searching for pieces that are both comfortable and stylish, such as satin nighties, which have generated twice as many searches as last year. Searches for silk nightgowns have multiplied by eight, while searches for men's pajamas have doubled. 

The report also reveals a range of other, more general trends. Goth stylings will apparently be another major feature of 2022 , with Pinterest users currently searching for the style in both the fashion and home categories, while check-pattern pieces, favored by both millennials and boomers, are also set to be a top trend.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 8, 2021","Zalando and Copenhagen Fashion Week have announced Fassbender, Iso.Poetism By Tobias Birk Nielsen and Tomorrow Denim as finalists for this season’s Zalando Sustainability Award at CFW.Taking place from February 1 to 4, it’s the third season of a three-year strategic partnership between the fashion e-tail giant and the fashion week with the award being key to the link-up.

The jury was “impressed by Fassbender’s use of a large variety of more sustainable materials as well as innovative production processes, such as 3D printing and microbial dyeing”. And it said the ability of Iso.Poetism By Tobias Birk Nielsen “to inspire and empower customers, as well as the focus on recycled materials and innovative dyeing techniques” were key. Tomorrow Denim’s “holistic approach from the use of organic and recycled materials to waste management” swung it for the label.Open to international applicants and aiming to encourage fashion brands to explore sustainability, the finalists were selected by an “international jury of thought leaders”. 

They included CFW chief executive Cecilie Thorsmark; sustainability editor of British Vogue, Emily Chan; model, environmental activist and sustainability consultant Arizona Muse; and sustainability and brand advisor Dio Kurazawa. There were also representatives from Zalando on the panel.

The jury members reviewed the applicants’ fundamental approach to sustainability and focused specifically on their use of certified materials, production processes, innovation, transparency and ability to apply a more sustainable approach to fashion.

The three finalists will receive funding for production costs and debut their designs in the Zalando Greenhouse, which will showcase the latest in sustainable fashion both on and offline. They’ll compete to win Zalando’s €20,000 Sustainability Award as well as a partnership with the retailer in developing an exclusive eco-focused capsule collection.

The jury will conduct a second review of the finalists and the collections they’re showcasing during CFW to select the winner, who’ll be announced on February 3.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 3, 2021","Amsterdam-based lifestyle fashion brand, Scotch & Soda, is teaming up with New York artist Edward Granger for the launch of a mural installation and two limited-edition t-shirts.Coinciding with Miami Art Week, the collaboration with Granger includes an artwork takeover on the façade of the Scotch & Soda Wynwood Miami store. The mural dubbed 'The Free Spirit of Miami', will be a unique addition to Wynwood Walls, known as one of Miami’s most creative districts, thanks to Granger’s use of geometric shapes and color, and will remain on display over the next year. 

Meanwhile, 'The Miami Spirit' limited-edition t-shirts equally feature Granger's signature abstract geometric artwork and act as an ode to the city’s lively colors and vibes. Available in both white and pink, the unisex cotton t-shirts will retail at $68. The collection is available for purchase on Scotch-Soda.com and at select Scotch & Soda stores in Florida.“When my gallery Tuleste Factory first came to me with the opportunity for a collaboration with Scotch & Soda, the vision became quickly clear: to create a visual representation of the free spirit in all of us,” said Granger, in a news statement. 

“A mural that would visually inform the viewer about the random, awkwardly beautiful fantasy world around every one of us. Each new shape begins to connect and capture gradients of colors with objects that are seamlessly diffused."" 

Scotch & Soda will celebrate the collaboration with a cocktail party on Thursday evening at Gitano, where Granger has created colorful geometric plywood structures as a temporary art installation for the occasion.

Scotch & Soda’s collections are available in 7,000 doors in some of the world’s biggest cities, including New York, London and Paris. By the end of the year, the brand is expected to have a portfolio of 249 stores around the world. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 2, 2021","In the cluttered workshop of his home off the coast of northwest Scotland, Ian Mackay patiently weaves a bright green wool, surrounded by bags of fabric, spools and tools.He makes a steady clatter as he pedals his machine in the shed of his croft on the village of South Shawbost on the Isle of Lewis, watching closely for any defects.

""It's handwoven... or rather foot-woven,"" the 51-year-old weaver jokes in his sing-song accent typical of the Outer Hebrides.Mackay spins wool for 10 hours a day, resting only on Sundays, when most shops and services are shut on the religiously conservative islands.

Once complete, his handiwork -- authentic Harris Tweed -- could be shipped to the other side of the world, as the rough woollen fabric becomes more popular than ever.

Long associated with the windswept Scottish islands, the textile's ecological and sustainable properties have inspired designers to be more environmentally friendly.

""It doesn't really matter how bad the weather is outside if you are weaving,"" Mackay told AFP as an icy November wind whipped across the ochre-coloured moor where sheep were grazing.

""There's no point in being really fast, doing mistakes. You are better doing slow, quality work.""

Such is its status, Harris Tweed, traditionally made from 100 percent pure virgin -- unrecycled -- sheep's wool, is the only fabric protected by an act of parliament.

The Harris Tweed Act 1993 stipulates that it ""has been handwoven by the islanders at their homes in the Outer Hebrides, finished in the Outer Hebrides, and made from pure virgin wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides"".

A distinctive Orb stamp globe with a cross on top certifies the fabric's origin and authenticity.

- High fashion export -

Harris Tweed, mostly woven with a plain weave, twill or herringbone structure, was originally associated with Britain's aristocracy and gentlemen farmers.

Jackets and plus-fours made from the durable fabric that can withstand harsh climates were a must for traditionally outdoor upper-class pursuits such as hunting and fishing.

But British designer Vivienne Westwood turned that image on its head by integrating it into her punk wardrobe in a subversion of culture and tradition.

Now other major brands, including Chanel, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Hermes, are making it a key element of their collections.

""Recently we have been working extensively with Polo Ralph Lauren in the USA,"" said Margaret Ann Macleod, sales director for Harris Tweed Hebrides.

Seventy people work at the company's lakeside factory, where the wool is dyed and spun, then sent to some 120 home weavers, where skills have been passed down for generations.

Once woven, it is returned to the factory 18 miles (29 kilometres) from Lewis' main town of Stornoway to be washed, dried and finished in Shawbost Mill.

A third of the Shawbost factory's output goes to the UK, while two-thirds is exported to all corners of the world.

""We export extensively to France, Germany, Italy and a lot of other countries in Europe,"" Macleod said.

""We also have a big export business in South Korea, Japan and the USA, and increasingly China has become a new export market for us as well.""

- Colour and culture -

In total, some 160 home weavers live in the Outer Hebrides, working hand in hand with three factories that produce a total of 1.5 million metres of the fabric every year.

Tweed, immortalised by Mr Toad, one of the main characters in Kenneth Grahame's 1908 classic novel ""The Wind in the Willows"", is used to make jackets, trousers, coats, but also shoes, handbags, armchairs and even teddy bears.

Fifteen years ago, the sportswear brand Nike chose Harris Tweed for a collection of trainers -- a huge publicity coup for the Hebridean craftsmen.

But more recently the public has rediscovered the fabric in its dozens of different patterns and shades through popular television series.

From the aristocrats of ""Downton Abbey"" to the gangsters of ""Peaky Blinders"" and the royal family in ""The Crown"", virtually everyone wears tweed.

""We start with about 60 colours and we blend each of these colours to create over 180 different yarn shades and they would reflect the landscape and the seascape of the Outer Hebrides -- the rich browns are the tones of the moorland, the blue of the Atlantic Ocean,"" Macleod said.

""Young designers are coming and are looking for the colours. They are looking for authenticity, the fact that we are hand-weaving (and) creating our own yarns is really important to them.

""They want to capture a little bit of the island, of the Outer Hebrides in their creations as well.""

"Dec 1, 2021","The fashion events calendar is struggling to get back to some sort of normality as UK lockdowns end while the pandemic rumbles on, and the menswear edition of London Fashion Week is being affected by this.The event was last held physically in January 2020 and after its no-show this year, won’t happen in January 2022 either.

The British Fashion Council told Fashionnetwork.com that the men’s collections will be shown alongside the women’s ones in February. The next edition of London Fashion Week runs from February 18-22 and will once again show both women’s and men’s collection in the hybrid physical-digital format that has now become the norm for so many fashion events.

The BFC will unveil the event’s schedule in early January and will be sharing all dates for 2022’s LFW editions next week.

Only this week, the organiser of Scoop and Pure London conformed that the two shows will be happening in a combined format again for their next editions. And globally, fashion weeks and trade shows are still not back to their full pre-pandemic strength.

This has led some labels to take the decision to show to their own timetable off-schedule, while others have switched to alternative fashion weeks to unveil their collections.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 1, 2021","After a year of fluctuations between comfort and elegance, albeit restrained, a wind of freedom may be blowing through fashion in 2022 with the return of punk style. While it may be unexpected, it's a style that seems fitting with the spirit of the times; its 2022 comeback looks to be characterized by eccentric and bold pieces, like leather jackets, studded accessories, or the quintessentially punk plaid pieces.A feeling of revolution, a craving for freedom, or a simple desire to put extravagance in their lives (in the absence of glitter), men and women are celebrating self-expression through a range of punk-inspired looks. It's a trend that's starting to take shape and which could reach a peak in 2022. And the return of the punk and grunge genres to the forefront of the music scene, with the re-release of Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" for instance, is very likely related. Punk -- with all its off-shoots -- is set to be the style storming into your closet within a few months' time.

Goodbye to boring looksThere's no need to wait for the stroke of midnight on December 31, to rush into your closet and pull out your punkiest pieces. Cautious glimpses of the trend are already showing up in various places. Etsy* looked at which fashion pieces are getting an increasing number of searches on its platform over the past three months to determine the styles that users are gradually embracing, and the results are clear: fishnet, studs and checks are clearly the rage. And while they may not totally define punk style in themselves, they are definitely key elements of it.

In greater detail, Etsy reports an 879% jump in searches for spiked collars in the past three months compared to the same period last year, as well as a more measured 34% increase in demand for studded belts. Another essential element of the punk style, that of vintage plaid clothing, is also gaining more fans in recent months with searches up 48%. But make sure you choose your checks carefully, and wear them with leather, faded or ripped denim, and boots, so that your punk look isn't mistaken for a lumberjack one -- not that there's anything wrong with a lumberjack look of course.

Leather jackets are not left out either, as they have seen a 21% increase in demand. And to complete the array, the only thing missing are fishnet accessories -- a basic -- for which searches are also up by 37%. The craze for punk fashion has crossed the virtual borders with countless looks to discover on various social networks. On TikTok, the hashtag #punkstyle has tallied more than 12 million views.

Emerald green reigns

Given the punk trend, red and black could have been the star colors of the year 2022. But of course fashion being fashion, it's full of contradictions and surprises ... And so, it is emerald green that is grabbing attention from internet users at the end of the year. Etsy reports a 64% increase in searches for this hue symbolizing nature, of course, but also freedom, hope, and especially renewal.

*To determine the fashion trends of 2022, the Etsy platform used the searches made by its 96 million buyers, and listed the searches that have increased significantly on its platform over the past three months.

"Dec 1, 2021","Armani Group said on Wednesday it would no longer use angora wool starting from the 2022-23 autumn/winter season, adding it to the list of excluded materials under its fur-free policy.The Italian luxury company joins a string of brands banning the extremely soft wool removed from live rabbits, under pressure from animal rights organisations and more environmentally conscious shoppers.

Last month, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) announced that luxury e-commerce platform Farfetch would stop selling angora wool by April 2022.The organisation launched a campaign years ago to ban angora wool, which is mainly produced in China, describing the techniques used to strip the fur from rabbits as cruel.

Armani's move marks another step towards sustainability after the group banned animal fur in 2016 and signed in 2019 the 'Fashion Pact' with other major industry players to address climate change, the company said in a statement.

"Nov 30, 2021","What lies at the heart of Ganni's success? This was the question that Retviews, the data analysis solution devised by digital consulting firm Lectra, has strived to provide an answer to. Over the years, the Danish women's ready-to-wear label, created in 2000 by gallery owner Frans Truelsen and later sold to Ditte and Nicolaj Reffstrup, has managed to emerge among other premium fashion brands thanks to its cool Scandinavian style and the support of a key player like L Catterton, the private equity firm co-founded by LVMH. The analysis by Retviews sheds light on Ganni’s winning strategy. A unique, versatile product rangeAccording to Retviews, Ganni stands out primarily for the composition of its collections, notably for its extensive selection of dresses. The latter account for 19% of Ganni’s range, compared with 7% for Acne Studios, 14% for The Kooples and 15% for Isabel Marant.An approach that is consistent with the label’s style, mirroring the casual-chic attitude of young Scandinavian women, and is also evident in the wide choice of colourful, directional patterns, which are featured in 43% of Ganni’s range.

The label also places a strong focus on its footwear products, which account for 20% of its accessories line. However, the Danish label features only 8% of sneakers among its footwear, compared with a 25% to 45% share among its direct competitors. Ganni is more focused on boots and moccasins, a product category that, according to Retviews by Lectra, has been highly successful with consumers in recent seasons. Ganni has also opted to feature 91% of its boots in rubber, a material that has become prominent in the last few years at various luxury labels, among them Italian label Bottega Veneta. Ganni’s boots are priced below those of its competitors.Attractive price positioningWhile other premium labels have increased their prices in recent years, according to Retviews, Ganni has stood by its original positioning, selling contemporary items at prices that are more affordable than those of its direct competitors.Although entry-level prices remain relatively similar among competitors, Ganni differentiates itself with its prices in the mid to high-end segments, with products priced between €145 and €1,295, compared for example to prices from €390 to €3,800 for Isabel Marant. 

Also, according to Retviews, Ganni remains competitive thanks to a collection consisting of 1,678 items, as opposed for example to 2,836 items for Acne Studios, as well as to its commitment to sustainable fashion.

Ganni, whose revenue grew by 1.3% in 2020, to approximately €100 million, has expanded its sustainable range, notably by creating a collection called ‘Re-Cut’, made using upcycled fabrics, and by launching a clothes rental service to limit over-consumption. 

To go even further, Ganni has also heralded its plan to replace leather with more environmentally friendly, plant-based alternatives within two years.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 30, 2021","The British Fashion Council promised a new and different experience for The Fashion Awards 2021 on Monday evening and while a red carpet and succession of award winners were what we’ve come to expect from high-profile awards ceremonies, there was undeniably plenty that stood out about this first post-pandemic edition of the event.Its new sponsor TikTok; the categories for which some of the awards were won; Alessandro Michele as an avatar (more of that later); and the big entertainment focus all made the evening that bit different.

But it was also memorable for one very sad aspect with the event always going to be overshadowed by the news that had broken a day earlier of the death of Virgil Abloh.Idris Elba opened the proceedings with a tribute to Abloh, who was coincidentally named as one of 15 “leaders of change” at the awards. The actor recited ‘When Great Trees Fall’ by Maya Angelou. The BFC’s CEO Caroline Rush and chair Stephanie Phair also praised him for being “a creative force of change, who throughout his career focused on inclusivity and philanthropy across fashion, art, music, design and architecture, making him one of the most influential designers of his generation”.

GENDER-NEUTRAL

One new feature of the awards was the move away from gendered titles. That meant no womenswear and menswear titles, just a single Designer of the Year prize that was won by Kim Jones. However, in this case, he did neatly cover both genders as he designs menswear for Dior and womenswear for Fendi.

Meanwhile Simone Rocha won the independent British brand award, and LVMH prize-winner Nensi Dojaka took the BFC Foundation award.

The Special Recognition Award for Culture Commentary went to ex-GQ editor-in-chief Dylan Jones, while editor-in-chief of Dazed magazine Ib Kamara won the Isabella Blow award for fashion creator. 

Tommy Hilfiger accepted the outstanding achievement award, and Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele took home the trailblazer title “for reversing the fortunes of the legendary Italian label”. A FOCUS ON CHANGE

Hosted by actor, singer, director, composer, and playwright Billy Porter, the event aimed to celebrate “fashion’s role at the intersection of culture while recognising the exceptional individuals whose imagination and creativity have broken new ground in fashion globally over the past 12 months, and brands and businesses that have transformed the possibilities of fashion today”.

As well as Virgil Abloh, it named another 14 leaders of change in three separate categories. Under the Creativity category, Alessandro Michele and Kim Jones were again on the list, along with Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga, and Jonathan Anderson for JW Anderson and Loewe.

Under the Environment banner, the honourees were Bethany Williams, Gabriela Hearst for Chloé as well as for her eponymous label, Phoebe English, Priya Ahluwalia and Stella McCartney.

And under the People title (recognising those who’ve “led change by encouraging equal, diverse, empowered workforces from head office to supply chain and shop floor”), the winners were British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, Harris Reed, Kenya Hunt, Samuel Ross and Telfar Clemens.

INNOVATION AND ENTERTAINMENT

The BFC also announced a brand new category with the first-ever Fashion Award for Metaverse Design in a link with Roblox. Its first winner was cSapphire. The new award recognises a digital designer who “pushes the boundaries and showcases excellence in digital fashion design within the metaverse”. Five digital fashion creators from the Roblox community were shortlisted by its developers and creators. And Gucci’s Alessandro Michele made an appearance as an avatar to present the prize in The Fashion Awards experience on Roblox.  

To celebrate the launch of the award, the BFC created an immersive experience on Roblox that’s available on the platform until December 7.

The evening also included a number of Special Celebrations “that showcased fashion’s role in culture at its best”. Chanel was recognised for its  pioneering commitment to the arts and hosted a performance by dancer, actor and model Lil Buck.

There was a tribute to Fashion East, and its talent and community from the past 20 years. And another tribute was paid to Kylie Minogue who performed Slow x Love To Love You Baby, The Infinite Disco version.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 29, 2021","Sustainable, made-to-order womenswear brand Katla has teamed up with designer Shelly Xu and her namesake start-up Shelly Xu Design (SXD) to introduce a new collaboration rooted in zero-waste design. Dubbed 'Katla x SXD', the partnership reimagines one of the most popular staples, the hoodie, with the aim to make it as sustainable as possible and with the overarching goal to promote zero-waste design in the fashion industry.  

Combining Katla's zero-waste manufacturing process and SXD's zero-waste design process, the hoodie saves 25 percent of the raw fabric material for less material consumption and less material cost. Available in black and white, the hoodie is made from Katla’s existing 100 percent organic cotton, GOTS-certified fleece.The genderfluid design is made to be versatile across sizes and features a spacious, clean silhouette. The final touch is a barcode label stitched on the back of the hoodie, which can be scanned to access the unique zero-waste pattern and to get sewing instructions for creators to make their own. The pattern is also available for download at katla.com. 

“Hundreds of millions of hoodies are produced in our industry. Imagine if all hoodies can be made this way. We also wanted as many people as possible to be a part of this movement,” Katla explained in a website statement. “We are making the design open source in the back of the hoodie so any curious creator can make their own zero fabric waste version.”

Likewise, each hoodie also includes a unique tracking number on an inside label — another conscious feature found across Katla’s collections —  where customers can enter the tracking number on their website to learn about the origins and history of the item.

Launched by the co-founder and former CEO of Moda Operandi, Aslaug Magnúsdóttir, Katla was created in 2020 with the goal to develop a blueprint for a new and different way of creating fashion that minimizes our impact on the environment. 

The new Katla x SXD hoodie is now available at katla.com in two sizes, and retails for $220.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 29, 2021","Matthew Rugamba knew his Rwandan fashion label had arrived when Junior Nyong'o, the brother of Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, attended the world premiere of ""Black Panther"" in a three-piece suit designed by him.Hours after the glitzy event in Los Angeles, the website for Rugamba's brand House of Tayo exploded as enquiries flooded in from around the globe for his high-end creations.

""It changed the perspective,"" the 32-year-old told AFP, still stunned by the turn of events that propelled his ""made-in-Rwanda"" label to a Hollywood red carpet.""For so many years we have been telling people our fashion is good... but sometimes you need moments like that to really take it to the next level,"" said Rugamba, who holds dual Rwandan and British nationality.

Kigali has yet to reach the heights of Africa's fashion hub Lagos, but the capital of the small landlocked nation of 13 million hosts its own fashion week and draws a devoted clientele, comprising wealthy locals, expatriates, members of the diaspora and tourists.

""I like the way they tailor the clothes, the way they design their clothes, I like the simplicity of it as well,"" said Emmanuel Safari, a lawyer and frequent visitor to the House of Tayo boutique located in an upscale Kigali neighbourhood.

""The clothes, you put them on and you feel good!"" 

Some Rwandan labels have even attracted the attentions of President Paul Kagame, who was pictured wearing a shirt by bespoke Kigali brand Moshions.'Change the narrative' But what is ""Kigali style""?

""It pops but it's not flashy,"" according to Jean-Victor Brun, a 50-year-old Haitian-American who came to Rwanda to develop projects in new technologies.

""Modern, ethnic, and rooted in the identity of our country,"" says Joselyne Umutoniwase, founder of Rwanda Clothing.

Identity is at the heart of many Rwandan brands, which excel in producing bespoke clothing -- drawing on a tailoring tradition that dates back decades.

For instance, Umutoniwase, who employs 45 people, incorporates the geometric designs characteristic of imigongo art -- a style of painting which uses cow dung and natural pigments -- into her creations.

Similarly, the beadwork found on royal headdresses and other traditional items finds its way onto jacket lapels, while Rwandan shoe label Uzuri K&Y borrows from the country's weaving traditions to create braided sandals.

The brand's co-founder Ysolde Shimwe said young designers like her were keen to change Rwanda's image, 27 years after the 1994 genocide killed more than 800,000 people, mainly Tutsis.

""Ten years ago when you Googled Rwanda you only saw machetes, people killing each other and hungry kids in the streets,"" she told AFP.

""We as designers in Rwanda are also contributing to change the narrative of Rwanda and mostly to changing how people perceive Rwanda, because we are more than that, we are more than our historical background.""Bullish prospects Rwanda's fashion industry has also received a helping hand from the government, which in 2016-17 massively hiked import taxes on second-hand clothing -- mainly from the US and Europe -- to promote local manufacturers.

The move, which saw duties multiply more than tenfold, effectively imposed a moratorium on trade involving the sale of secondhand clothing from the West at low prices to East African consumers.

Simultaneously the government allowed designers to import fabric tax-free, giving the nascent industry a boost, said Umutoniwase.

But, with more than 80 percent of the population living in rural areas, according to the World Bank, many Rwandans cannot afford these homegrown brands.

Umutoniwase, whose prices range from around $70 (60 euros) for a shirt to $80 (70 euros) for a dress, told AFP the small market size presented big challenges.

Moreover, the devastation wrought by the genocide has also contributed to a huge skills shortage in the country, said designer Shimwe.

""Eight years ago when we wanted to start a shoemaking brand we could not necessarily find skilled labour, there was literally nobody that had experience or had shoemaking skills,"" she said.

But in a sign of the industry's bullish growth prospects, some of the nearly 1,100 staff trained by her have since gone on to found their own labels, she said.

""It's a great cycle that we have been able to create.""Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Nov 26, 2021","Just when you thought that brands were getting back to doing live shows on runways, when along comes Vetements with another digital lookbook in an ode to Bitcoin billionaires. 
Which just about made sense, as the collection was an ode to the new wealth created by social media entrepreneurs.
 
Though, apparently, very much celebrity-shy new clients for this brand, seeing as practically every one of the 72 looks featured a mask. And in an ironic piece of mickey-taking on modern materialism, the backdrop to the static lookbook was a wallpaper made of One Million Dollar greenbacks. The print reappeared on clunky space-age boots, face masks and even a Statue of Liberty gown.“Originally catering to royals and the aristocracy, in the early 20th century couturiers focused on a new type of clients - industry tycoons and their families, who made money with everything from oil and real estate to butter and chocolate bars,” the brand’s director Guram Gvasalia explained in a mock-up of a Wikipedia page, sent with the show press release. Which joked that the show budget was one billion dollars.
 “With the Fall-Winter 22-23 main collection, Vetements is pushing to redefine the couture and savoir-faire of the previous generations for the new era, that is defined by all-new social and economic phenomenon’s that can transform a person’s life overnight - the new wealth of Bitcoin millionaires. Someone who invested 1000 dollars in Bitcoin in 2010 would now be worth short of 80 million dollars; social media millionaires who rose to fame and wealth by simply being themselves and sharing the most private moments of their lives,” continued Guram, the brother of Demna, designer of Balenciaga.
 
The net result was a collection with all the edgy attitude and voluminous silhouettes one expects from Vetements, though often in unlikely new fabrics. The men’s and women’s double-breasted blazers and coats were cut with supreme aplomb yet made in atypical fabrics like jersey and molton wool. Though the biggest news was body stockings in fantastic prints – from industrial screws and bolts to calendars and betting slips to autumn leaves. 
The exaggerated volumes, shiny velour, wacky prints and brilliantly cut wrap cocktails all oozed streetwise glamour. However, it remains rather ironic that the DNA of Vetements; created by two Georgian refugee brothers, and referencing thrift shop, secondhand styling, should now be considered the go-to destination for Bitcoin billionaires.
 
An awful lot of people have made a lot of money from Bitcoin. As did many people during the South Sea Bubble of 1720, that era’s most famous financial collapse. But many people also lost shirts in the South Sea Bubble, including Sir Isaac Newton, and many older, wiser heads expect thousands to do so in Bitcoin, as the last people in are left holding the bag.
 
But at least when they do, they can buy one of Vetements new T-shirts as a consolation. It reads: 'Money can’t make me happy, but Vetements can.'

"Nov 26, 2021","Craig Green will return to stage his next collection in London, staging an off-calendar in the week prior to the UK capital’s next runway season in February. 
The show will mark the first catwalk outing by Green since before the start of the global pandemic. He last staged a catwalk show in Paris's Marais district in January 2020 during the French menswear season. Though in September 2020, Green did unveil some looks in a live broadcast inside Modes, a fashion-forward story located in Piazza Risorgimento, Milan.
 
“The Craig Green Autumn/Winter 2022 collection will be shown in the brand's hometown of London, week of the 7th February 2022. Further details to follow,” said the house in a terse release.Green founded his label in 2012, straight after graduating from the MA Fashion course at Central Saint Martins in London. Today he is regarded by many as the single most original voice in menswear. 
The 35-year-old designer is known for his ability to create functional clothing of couture quality, imbued with architectural ideas. His signature techniques of adding adjustable straps; wooden slats and dangling headgear into his ensembles create uniquely powerful fashion statements.
 
Green was named British Menswear Designer at the Fashion Awards in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Moreover, he also received the ultimate accolade of being invited as a guest designer in June 2018 to the world’s most important menswear salon, Pitti Uomo in Florence, where he staged a show deep inside the Boboli Gardens.
 
Pieces from Green’s cerebral collections are now in the permanent collection of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.

"Nov 25, 2021","French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire trumpeted the absolute necessity that France remain a culture open to foreign ideas at the official inauguration of the new IFM campus, Paris’ goal to create a major league fashion school. 
Underlining the determination of the French luxury and fashion establishment, Le Maire addressed a gang of key French luxe brand executives, including the chairmen and CEOs of such mega brands as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermès, Balenciaga and Galeries Lafayette, along with the presidents of multiple fabric and manufacturing federations.
 
“IFM represents a spirit of education. And for me education is the most important project for a nation and a society… IFM is also a spirit of international conquest. Here in IFM there are many foreign students and I believe that a nation is strongest when it doesn’t have any fear of foreigners. France is not a country than shrinks when you wash it. That might happen with clothes, never with France. Because we have a sufficiently strong and rich culture that foreign ideas can only enrich it, making a stronger, finer and more dominant new couture. That’s why I say to all the foreigners who have come to render honor to IFM by studying here, 'you are welcome here and in France',” insisted Le Maire.Even if this was a speech to fashion insiders it was very much perceived as a commentary on the current presidential race in France. Where an extremist right-wing journalist Eric Zemmour, who recently went on trial for racist hate speech, is the fastest rising candidate in opinion polls. 
“Back in 2019 we were a little group of about 50 to celebrate the opening the IFM underground. Today we are hundreds to celebrate the latest extension to the campus,” recalled Le Maire, whose ministry is located on the opposite side of the Seine.
 
He added that over one quarter of the students received grants to study at IFM, underlying its opening to less-than-wealthy applicants. “I’d like to break this image of fashion as an elitist endeavor. It’s an industry that provides 600,000 jobs and €150 billion in turnover.”
 
After a tour of the student ateliers and studios, FashionNetwork.com asked Le Maire were his views the same for other sectors.
 
“Of course, openness is vital not just in fashion. When you have a strong culture like ours, foreign ideas don’t weaken you they reinforce you. Don’t forget the two principal bosses of France’s two great auto companies are of foreign origin. Carlos Tavares is Portuguese and Luca De Meo of Italian origin,” noted Le Maire, everyone wearing a mask.
 
Why was he so convinced that IFM could rival major schools like St Martins in London or FIT in New York? Didn’t IFM, despite its great potential, risk becoming the Paris Saint Germain of fashion; a football team owned by the Qatari royal family that rules in France, but stumbles in international competitions?
 
“That’s a provocative remark, but you have touched an important point. Education is fundamental, and that’s we have also pushed to create a great gastronomic school. If there is a fault in France, it was the lack of a great global-level fashion college. Because we cannot have the most famous fashion in the world and not have a fashion college of the same renown. When I first came here two years ago that was a bet. Now it is becoming a reality. I’ll give you one figure; there are 1,000 places in this college, and 6,000 applicants.”
 
Le Maire, a smooth and silky orator, is also known as an outspoken critic of Brexit.
 
“I regret the decision taken by the British people, though their decision is sovereign. However, I also believe that fashion is linked to one’s national culture. So, there’s French fashion, Italian fashion and Spanish fashion. Yet, there is also a European culture, to which I am attached, and I am very happy that France remains a pillar in the construction of Europe.
 
Prior to a ribbon-cutting ceremony, Xavier Romatet, the IFM’s Dean, addressed the gathering. 
“Our goal is to create a school that will become an international reference.
And figures often speak very clearly. Today, there are 1,000 students, rising to 1,200 in two years’ time: in a campus of 9,000 square-meters by next fall. Of which 300 students from outside of France coming from 48 countries. Studying in 16 different programs in three main streams – savoir faire, creation and management,” Romatet said.
 
Founded first in 1986 as a fashion management school, IFM was later amalgamated with the Chambre Syndicale’s famed fashion design college, moving the combined school to east Paris and a new location, Les Docks, a snake-like, modernist apple green glass structural rolling along the Right Bank of the Seine.
 
Referencing Pierre Bergé, the godfather of the project; Didier Grumbach, the long-time president of the Chambre Syndicale, which controlled all fashion seasons in Paris, and his two predecessors, Dominique Jacomet and Pascal Morand, Romatet also revealed that 280 students were studying towards bachelor’s degrees in savoir faire and craftmanship. A further 380 in fashion design and creation creating new silhouettes “respecting everyone’s cultural identity.”
 
In a recent agreement the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the Chambre Syndicale’s successor, has agreed to put a joint IFM master graduate runway show on the official calendar.
 
A further 310 are studying a masters in luxury management, profiting from lectures and courses provided by over 200 senior experts culled from the upper reaches of French management.
 
“We are the only fashion school in the world that offers all these three types of training. That permits students to understand better the codes of design and the language of creation,” the dean concluded.

"Nov 23, 2021","Vetements and its new line VTMNTS continue to advance along parallel paths. After presenting the Spring/Summer 2022 collection online in May, the label founded in 2014 by Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia, and led since his departure in 2019 by his brother Guram, has announced it will showcase its new collection for the Fall/Winter 2022-23 once again online, on Thursday November 25 at 7:11 pm CET. Vetements told FashionNetwork.com that its new label, VTMNTS, will instead stage a physical catwalk show in January 2022, at an undisclosed venue.In summer, Vetements launched a brand-new line, VTMNTS, whose clothes and accessories are characterised by “understated, sustainable luxury,” featuring genderless models mostly inspired by menswear (leather and quilted jackets, tight-fitting t-shirts, generously cut trousers and more), on which the logo is replaced by a bar code.

Vetements is keen to change the rules of the market's game, and VTMNTS is the first project inspired by this new approach. In summer, when Vetements launched this “top secret” initiative, it also announced it had set up the Gvasalia Family Foundation, whose goal is to provide resources and genuine backing to young emerging labels in areas like production and distribution.The idea was to introduce an innovative project on the market, with the goal of “redefining traditional luxury for the next generation.” In other words, VTMNTS is positioned as a high-end label, with products of extremely high quality and great attention paid to details and finishings, while expressing a unique vision, set apart from that of the major luxury conglomerates.

“The goal is to offer younger generations the same level of quality that Hermès gives to its sophisticated clientèle. The label is entirely separate from Vetements,” the company, which is based in Zurich, told FashionNetwork.com. VTMNTS is indeed an independent project, linked to Vetements only “through a degree of synergy in terms of resources and know-how.” Initially, the new line seemed destined to replace Vetements, which experienced a runaway success under the aegis of Demna Gvasalia but is now going through a declining phase.
 
The first collection by VTMNTS consists of 100 looks. It was unveiled in July and will arrive in-store in December. It has already won over some 100 leading multibrand retailers worldwide, among them 10 Corso Como, Antonioli, Adelaide, Boon The Shop, Browns, End, H.Lorenzo, Joyce, KM20, Luisa Via Roma, Maxfield LA , Saks Fifth Avenue, The Webster, Tsum and Ssense.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 22, 2021","The house of JW Anderson will move its next men’s show and its pre-fall collections to Milan, to be unveiled during the next fashion week in that city in January.
 
The UK fashion house will also be listed on the official calendar of the  Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, the governing body of Italian runway seasons in Milan. 
“It’s very important news because it shows once again there is a special openness in Milan to welcome creative young independent designers to our city. Jonathan Anderson is a special talent, and we are very happy to have him showing in Milan,” confirmed Carlo Capasa, the president of the Camera della Moda.
 
Milan’s next menswear season is due to be staged from January 14 to 18; and will follow the three-day menswear fair in Florence, Pitti Uomo, which will include a headline show by the house of Ann Demeulemeester.Anderson, one of the most exciting talents on the London fashion scene, last staged a menswear show in Paris in January 2020, an homage to French poet Arthur Rimbaud and artist and cult Lower East Side activist David Wojnarowicz. His last women’s runway show was a month later in the UK with a bravura hyper-dimensioned collection inside his preferred London locale, Yeoman House.
 
Given his current cult status as a happening designer and success in his night job as creative director of Spanish brand Loewe, the decision of Anderson to move his next show to Milan represents a considerable coup for the Italian fashion capital.
 
Since the debut of the pandemic, Anderson has restricted himself to multiple versions of shows-in-a-box, the most recent a glossy calendar shot by Juergen Teller, even including images of the portly German photographer in his briefs. Many versions of JW’s box shows have gone onto become collectors’ items treasured by fashionistas.“Jonathan’s decision also underlines that independent designers feel very attracted to Milan. Right now, Milan has a great deal of positive energy and that is fueling designers desire to show in our city,” added Capasa.
 
He suggested that Anderson may show both the men’s fall 2021/22 collection and his women’s pre-collection together.
 
“They are still defining how exactly how they want to stage their collections, and we are happy to support their eventual choice,” said Capasa.
 
The provisional calendar of the next Milan menswear season is due out in early December.
 
Anderson has shown in Italy before, as a guest of Pitti Uomo in Florence in June 2017, when he unveiled a collection marked by multiple images of himself, unveiled in the garden of the late Renaissance villa La Pietra, in the hills above the Tuscan capital.
 
The Northern Irish-born designer has also shown a collab collection he created as part of Moncler Genius with the Italian marque.

"Nov 19, 2021","First Louis Vuitton dressed the FIFA World Cup trophy of football. Now it has created the case for the next Rugby World Cup, due to take place in 2023 in France. 
Vuitton plans to unveil its latest trophy case this Saturday night, when France’s national team takes on New Zealand, historically the planet’s greatest team, in Paris.
 
Entirely made to measure, this unique case will transport the justly legendary golden Webb Ellis Cup, named after the boy in the English public school of Rugby, who first picked up a ball and ran, back in 1823.The 10th Rugby World Cup for men takes place from September 8 to October 28, 2023, with matches in 10 stadia and nine cities in several regions of France.
 
Handcrafted by expert Louis Vuitton craftsmen in its historic workshops of Asnières, the case is dressed in the brand’s signature monogram canvas, while its two front panels are adorned with a 'V' - for 'Victoire' and 'Vuitton' - painted in blue, white and red echoing the colors of the competition. While 'XV' – the number of players on each team - appears in Roman letters on one of the panels. All adorned with angles, a lock and brass clasps identical to those used by the House since the 1860s.
 
“With this new official Trophy Travel Case, Louis Vuitton is proud to continue its commitment with rugby, highlighting its 160-year tradition of creating remarkable trunks for the most prestigious trophies in the world. It is a great opportunity to bring our “savoir-faire” to one of the world’s greatest sporting events, and once again to prove that ‘Victory Travels in Louis Vuitton’,” enthused Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO.
 
Added Claude Atcher, France 2023 CEO: “Rugby World Cup France 2023 will showcase to the world all that France has to offer. This Official Travel Case is a wonderful representation of Louis Vuitton’s unique expertise and craftsmanship.”
 
In effect, Vuitton has become the go-to destination for major global sporting trophies. Besides this Vuitton Webb Ellis Cup case, it has enveloped iconic trophies such as the FIFA World Cup; the NBA’s Larry O’Brien Trophy; League of Legends; Formula 1’s Grand Prix de Monaco; Davis Cup; Roland Garros, and the America’s Cup.

"Nov 17, 2021","After spending several months in jogging suits and slippers, the return to normal life -- or to the office -- has been synonymous with a renewed interest in more sophisticated, elegant, or just more wearable clothes. Comfort remained the watchword throughout 2021, but with a certain desire to return to sexier pieces, and an enduring need to do away with certain stereotypes and diktats linked to the notion of gender.On the surface it may seem that two of the main trends of 2021 -- ultra sexy style and a non-gendered wardrobe -- fly somewhat in the face of other observations of the year, but both trends are underpinned by a clear, distinctly expressed determination to dress as one pleases. That could mean wearing a transparent dress, baggy pants or a jumpsuit -- a flagship item of non-gendered dressing -- or creations straight out of the 2000s (Y2K is indeed a fashion trend, not a temporary password). They are defined by a desire to be at ease with one's sartorial choices, and not have them be dictated by societal ideas of what might better suit one body shape or cover one ""flaw"" or another, or hide away anything else that doesn't fit into society's neat boxes. Perhaps this is the true major trend of 2021. Less gender-specificWith its power of influence -- social networks can also be a force for good -- Gen Z has managed to accomplish within just a few months what no other generation had even attempted before: to make brands cede to certain of their demands and needs, including that of blurring the border between genders, and enabling everyone to wear clothes that are not indelibly defined as feminine or masculine. As a result, the collections have evolved considerably throughout the year, with launches for both men and women, but also drops, capsules, and sometimes even complete ranges, designed for everyone.

It's a phenomenon that has fueled several micro-trends, such as that of a women's wardrobe inspired by dad's dressing. If you know about dad shoes, you'll get the picture. In any case, this is one of the trends highlighted by the Fashion Recap 2021 report of global fashion search platform Stylight.* This has resulted in a boom in oversized pieces, but also in clothes that you could find in your father's closet. XXL chokers, for example, saw a 317% increase in Google searches, while oversized trenchcoats got a boost (+223%), as well as sleeveless sweaters (+53%). There was also more interest this year in men's loose-fitting pants (+21%).A touch of sexyWhile lockdowns have had an impact on work attire, which is now much less strict than before the pandemic, it has also fueled some sartorial frustrations. Dressing sexy at home for a virtual cocktail party or a candlelit dinner, why not, but our hearts weren't really in it throughout the pandemic. As a result, these sexy accents that were so missed throughout the pandemic are back but magnified, with a strong taste observed for fully transparent tops and dresses (+222% of Google searches), low-rise pants (+42% of clicks on Stylight), and cut-out dresses (+19%), reveals the report from the search platform.

This desire to reconnect with sexy dressing was also observed on the red carpets. Megan Fox and Kendall Jenner are among the celebrities who stood out in fully transparent dresses, Fox at the MTV Video Music Awards, Jenner at the MET Gala, validating this micro-trend directly linked to the end of a -- very -- long period of isolation and distancing.

In its annual report, Stylight also selected ten personalities who influenced fashion in 2021, starting with Damiano David, from rock band Måneskin, who, like Harry Styles, is contributing on a large scale to deconstructing gendered dressing with crop tops, low-cut bodysuits, and fishnet tops. Britney Spears, the Y2K trend, and Ho Yeon Jung, heroine of the series ""Squid Game,"" are of course part of this Top 10, as well as Jennifer Lopez, who made a resounding return to the catwalks as well as on red carpets this year.

*This report is based on Stylight's internal data from its 120 million annual users in the 16 markets where it operates. All data refers to the same time periods to ensure that the figures are comparable and to clearly show trends or products where interest has particularly increased. Clicks on different categories or product pages on Stylight's international pages were compared from January 1, 2021 to October 15, 2021. The same period also applies to the data on search interest on Google Trends.

"Nov 17, 2021","Gucci is making a strategic U-turn. Two years after its last runway presentation in Milan, the Italian luxury house is preparing to show in the Lombard capital once again, according to the label's CEO, Marco Bizzarri, who spoke at the Pambianco Fashion Summit on Tuesday. In a release issued following the announcement, Kering's flagship brand further specified that its return to Milan Fashion Week will take the form of a show scheduled for February 2022, two years after its last presentation on the official calendar, which took place in February 2020. The brand is also planning two other shows, one in late spring, the other in September 2022. 

Similarly to other houses, including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, which is also part of Kering's portfolio, the Italian label stepped away from the official fashion calendar during the pandemic, opting instead to reveal its collections in other places, at other times and through new formats. In May 2020, creative director Alessandro Michele announced that he wanted to follow his own rhythm for future runway shows. ""I feel the urgent need to change a lot of things in the way I work,"" he wrote on his Instagram account, denouncing ""deadlines which risk to humiliate creativity"" and ""an excessive performativity that today really has no raison d'être.""

Following this announcement, Michele unveiled a first collection via video in July 2020, then another in November with a festival of several short films. This year, the Aria collection was once again livestreamed via an online show in April, while, for its latest collection, the label returned to physical events with a runway show hosted in Hollywood at the start of November.  
 
Implemented in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, this off-calendar strategy has clearly not achieved all of its desired results. With the new program announced by Gucci on Tuesday, it seems that the brand has decided to return to a steadier, more traditional runway tempo. 

The label, which is a major growth driver at Kering, saw its sales slow somewhat in the third quarter. Revenues increased 3.8% year over year to 2.18 billion euros, with the company's managers describing the period as a quarter of transition, seeing as the Aria collection, which was shown later in the season, will not arrive in stores before the end of September. It is hoped, however, that the collection will ensure an acceleration in Gucci's sales at the end of this year.  Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 12, 2021","After street style (finally) managed to make a place for itself in the fashion and luxury worlds, its moment of glory may already be coming to an end. With the rise of the Old Money aesthetic, the aristocrats are out for revenge with a classic, ultra-chic -- and highly respectable -- style, usually reserved for a handful of insiders. It's currently all the rage on social media, bringing to the fore pieces that were once thought to be the preserve of the elite.When it comes to fashion, it looks like you've got a choice between the uninhibited style of the 2000s and the Old Money aesthetic. Because while the noughties vibe looked like the dominant trend on the rise in recent weeks, it now seems like we'll all be dipping into the closets of the aristocracy to stay up to date this season. Gone are the jogging suits, sneakers and hoodies with oversized logos -- replaced by a more classic, more discreet kind of chic, inherited from a handful of heirs who swear by polo shirts and cable-knit sweaters.

What is the Old Money aesthetic?The term Old Money essentially refers to the nobility, the aristocracy, or the WASP crowd. It's about people who inherited wealth, rather than earning their money by working. The aesthetic is comparable to the preppy look that was popular a few years ago, but in an even more chic version, like you just got back from the tennis club. Except that, with it now being winter, it's more like you just got back from the ski slopes, with this slightly retro touch that makes all the difference.

Contrary to what you might think, the craze for this aesthetic is being seen across all generations, and even among the youngest fashion fans. In fact, the hashtag #oldmoneyaesthetic has more than 90 million views worldwide on TikTok, while #oldmoney already counts 322 million. No doubt that you too will soon be gradually won over by this next-level preppy look.

Ralph Lauren and cable-knit sweaters

This ultra-classic, super chic style inevitably brings to mind the Ralph Lauren brand, a master of the art. And there's no mistaking it. The global fashion search platform Stylight* reports a 98% increase in clicks for the label on its international platforms in early November, compared to the same period a year earlier. The rise is even more striking for the après-ski-chic Moon Boot brand, with clicks jumping more than 1,000%.

In practical terms, the Old Money aesthetic signals the return of furry boots -- did they ever go away? -- with a 657% increase in Google search interest for this product category. But it also translates into a closet stuffed with quilted vests (+75%) and leggings or stirrup pants (+75%) -- a nice way for millennials to revisit childhood fashions -- as well as cable-knit sweaters (+33%), and shearling or sheepskin-effect coats (+12%).

All that's left is to embrace this retro-inspired style, like you're fresh back from the slopes but rocking it in the city... Unless, that is, you prefer the sweater dresses, denim jackets, patchwork jeans -- preferably flared -- and other key pieces from the early 2000s, the other strong trend of the moment. Over to you.

* The report is based on analysis of Stylight and Google Trends data for the period November 1-7, 2021, compared to November 1-7, 2020.

"Nov 12, 2021","The winners of this year’s Council of the Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Awards were announced at a star-studded event on Wednesday night, with Christopher John Rogers and Emily Bode Aujla taking the evening’s top honors. 
Taking over the Pool + the Grill in the Seagram Building, on New York’s Park Avenue, for its return to in-person festivities, the CFDA Awards ceremony was hosted by Emily Blunt this year.
 
Over the course of the night, Brooklyn-based designer Christopher John Rogers was named American Womenswear Designer of the Year, while Emily Bode Aujla of Bode took the title of American Menswear Designer of the Year.Known for his bold use of color, Rogers can boast high-profile fans including the likes of Michelle Obama and Rihanna, and was previously named American Emerging Designer of the Year by the CFDA in 2020.
 
Bode Aujla, who became the first female designer to show at New York Fashion Week: Men’s in 2017, also received the CFDA’s Emerging Designer Award in 2019.

"Nov 11, 2021","F. Scott Fitzgerald’s oft-quoted adage that there are 'no second acts in American public life' is often taken as a warning to fashion designers not to embark on a perilous attempt to re-invent themselves in a second career. 
It is certainly a maxim disregarded by one of fashion’s most iconoclastic designers, Martin Margiela, whose latest post-fashion creativity is displayed in an intriguing exhibition at Lafayette Anticipations, a novel and experimental art center in Paris' Marais district created by the famed department store chain of the same name.
 
The path from designer to artist is often a perilous one. Just ask Helmut Lang, who was the single most influential designer in the world in the late '90s, earning him endless ecstatic reviews for his collections. Which rapidly turned into brutal put-downs when he gave up clothes and attempted to become a fine artist from 2005.Margiela, however, looks like he may be escaping similar opprobrium. In part, because the Belgian designer was as much a conceptual artist as a designer in his two-decade career in fashion. But also because his central obsessions in this show are those that gripped him while he was designing fashion: the cult of celebrity; anonymity; disposable consumerism; homoeroticism and the vindication of secrecy. The last is very vital for Margiela. To this day, Margiela has never posed for a portrait photo, and few people – even many fashion editors who have attended multiple Margiela collections – know what Martin looks like. 
“One thing I made clear to Martin when he spoke about becoming an artist after fashion was that I always, and already, regarded him as an artist while he was still creating fashion,” explained Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel, director of Lafayette Anticipations.
 
Yet, instead of a retrospective, we have a series of experimental artworks many actually made in the basement of Lafayette Anticipations, which has an impressive state-of-the-art design atelier where the uber discreet designer/artist would toil. All the art on display was actually ready nearly two years ago, though the exhibition was pushed until this autumn due to the pandemic.
 
“Martin working here is the whole point of Lafayette Anticipations, since we wanted a space where contemporary artists were given carte blanche to create whatever they wanted, and to their own rhythm,” explained Guillaume Houzé, scion of the family which owns the Galeries Lafayette, and the brainchild behind the space. A former warehouse and later school, the building was completely rebuilt inside by architect Rem Koolhaas, who introduced two giant central floors that can be raised on electronic pulleys to alter the art space into literally scores of configurations. 
Staying close to his roots, the 64-year-old Margiela, whose brother is a hairdresser, showed multiple images of hair through this art show, which was divided into a series of 20 partitioned rooms over two floors. Beginning with Hair Portraits, composed of five large stacks of news and celebrity magazines; each topped by five mock glossy covers depicting stars like Monica Vitti or Catherine Deneuve, though all with their faces covered entirely in, well, their own hair.
 
While another installation, Vanitas, is an abstract portrait of a woman portrayed in the five stages of hair in her life. The five wigged heads, made of silicone and real human hair, are encased inside a glass box.
 
 “This is very much part of the Flemish artistic tradition. How do you portray death, the end of life or the Memento Mori? Martin’s solution – the five stages of life from youth; preparing for her first child; the first gray hairs; dyeing her hair and then silvery old age,” noted Lamarche-Vadel in a tour of the show. Like 17th century Dutch painting, focusing on the representation of objects that symbolize the emptiness of existence. 
As a designer Margiela was known for making the commonplace out of the unexpected – like his notorious corsets made out of recycled white leather stilettos. As an artist Martin does something similar – building that ubiquitous urban object, the bus shelter, out of dirty plexiglass and fake fur, the better to reimagine this place of refuge from sun or sleet. While the entrance way to space is composed of a giant photo of a deodorant stick – whose written composition is a list of this art show’s raw materials.
 
Similarly, Margiela as a designer was obsessed with human and animal forms. His most famous footwear was a cloven-toed boot. As an artist, he plays around with classical ideas of anatomy, but then presents just chunks of the human torso, in silicone or plaster, deconstructing ancient ideas about divinity and heroism into almost mutant body parts. Another room features giant red false nails in Nymphenburg porcelain.
 
In a word, Martin Margiela is not perhaps a new Damien Hirst or Anselm Kiefer, but he will certainly escape the brickbats that bombarded dear Helmut Lang.
 
Martin Margiela at Lafayette Anticipations continues to January 2, 2022.

"Nov 3, 2021","Gucci has set out to conquer Hollywood with an especially memorable runway show. In order to present his Spring/Summer 2022 collection, creative director Alessandro Michele took over Hollywood Boulevard, the iconic, star-paved avenue and symbol of American cinema, where he hosted a gigantic show for an audience of celebrities on Tuesday night. 
 The runway show was attended by the likes of Diane Keaton, Gwyneth Paltrow, Billie Eilish and Dakota Johnson, not forgetting Salma Hayek, who also happens to be the wife of François-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci's parent company, Kering. These and other stars took up their positions in director's chairs lined up along the Walk of Fame, which was lit by spotlights and colorful signs. 
 
Backed up by vocals from Björk, the show's 115 models, which included actors Jared Leto and Macaulay Culkin, stepped out of the legendary TCL Chinese Theatre and strode down an illuminated strip of the boulevard to create the magical ""Gucci Love Parade,"" the name chosen for this event, which wore its cinematic influences on its sleeve. Indeed, Michele, whose mother was an assistant for a production company at Rome's Cinecittà, drew on childhood memories and maternal tales of this Italian dream factory in order to design his new men's and womenswear collection. Feathers, rhinestones, sunglasses, evening gloves, long trains, femme fatale fishnets: the entire mythology of Hollywood's golden age was condensed into this glamourous wardrobe, with silhouettes and details that inevitably reminded one of the great actresses of that time, from Rita Hayworth to Veronica Lake, via Joan Crawford. Perched on open 1940s-style platform shoes and sporting celebrity-worthy sunglasses, the women paraded in satin sheaths, long shimmering lace dresses with frills, or intangible tulle outfits. Never-ending boas were tossed over shoulders and dangled down to kiss the ground, while the lapels of one chic cardigan were elevated with fur. Models also wore sumptuous three-piece suits in shiny satin and large coats bristling with feathers. Elsewhere, they adopted a sportier, more relaxed register, pairing vinyl bustier bras with leggings or skintight catsuits. 
 
The men donned the same leggings under tuxedo jackets for an ultra-chic effect. Extra-large bowties were de rigueur for the boys, who wore their deliciously 70s-inspired suits with the deep U-shaped waistcoats typically paired with tuxes. Some opted for Wild West stylings, accessorizing with wide-brimmed Stetsons and cowboy boots, while zipped workwear-like jumpsuits, including one version in pink satin, rounded out the menswear offering. Naturally, many of the pieces on show could be worn by either men or women. 

All in all, the show was a formidable feat for Gucci, which is hoping to return to stronger growth. It was also a great seduction effort targeting the American market, ahead of the rapidly approaching release date of Ridley Scott's long-awaited House of Gucci, which notably stars Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, and none other than Jared Leto.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 2, 2021","The Red Carpet Green Dress (RCGD) contest winners have been announced with this year's winning duo being UK-based Yuriko Fukuda and Singapore’s Zhi Hong Benjamin Koh.The contest, in partnership with Tencel and software specialist CLO, involved applicants designing a sustainable gown or a suit and was open to emerging and established designers over the age of 21. 

Applicants submitted a digital sketch of their sustainable red carpet design before the international contest closed in August. The designs themselves haven't been released but they'll be given a big publicity boost early next year.So now to the winners. Born in Japan, Yuriko Fukuda is this year's womenswear winner. As a current Regents University London student, she “strongly believes in sustainable fashion”. 

She said: “Expressing myself through design feels like meditation. Our minds and art are indeed interconnected, having a bi-directional impact on our mental health. Fashion is a work of art and I believe it has the power to control our mind and body. Sustainable fashion revolves around timeless cuts, durability, natural resources and perceived health benefits, it's a unique way of presenting luxury. Sustainability is an exciting and new way of creating a better future for all.”Meanwhile, Singapore-based fashion, textile and product designer Zhi Hong Benjamin Koh is this year's menswear winner. 

Having studied at Singapore Polytechnic, in 2016, he founded The Material Atelier by BEN, a multi-disciplinary creative studio focused on seeking sustainable fashion, featuring collaborations with local artists to create sustainable wearable art. 

“One of our goals is to inform the public through informative videos about what goes into the material and the design of their garments”, he said. “Since its launch, the atelier has created a few products, one of which won a Merit Award at the Singapore Creator Award Competition in 2019.”

The two designs chosen by the winners will be put into production in early 2022 with “sustainable eco-couture textiles” in collaboration with Tencel and sponsored by CLO. The looks will be showcased as part of an exhibition to leading sustainable advocates in Los Angeles. 

The winners “will be introduced to a sustainable fashion and entertainment audience from across the globe” with their designs being produced and worn at the Red Carpet Green Dress event next year.

The winners will also receive a monetary award and business mentorship with RCGD's CEO Samata Pattinson, plus support and access to RCGD's extensive network, and creative support for their fledgling careers.

Pattinson said: “The global design contest is such a great opportunity for those who are eager to immerse themselves and learn more. As a former winner myself, I know the incredible opportunities brought forward to the winners and I'm excited to watch Yuriko Fukuda and Zhi Hong Benjamin Koh grow and gain their place in the sustainable world.”

Harold Weghorst, VP of Global Marketing & Branding at Lenzing, who was also on the judging panel, added: ""Yuriko and Benjamin present a strong statement of sustainability with beautiful and elegant designs which aim to improve other people's lives by reducing carbon footprint. We are delighted to announce them as our well-deserved winners.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 27, 2021","Bottega Veneta has got its sights firmly set on the United States, a strategy that was clear in its decision to unveil its collection for Spring/Summer 2022 in Detroit. Following Moschino's New York show in September and just before Gucci hits Los Angeles on November 3, the Kering-owned Italian luxury brand chose this unexpected fashion destination for ""Salon 03,"" the latest in the series of off-calendar events that the label's creative director, Daniel Lee, has been organizing over the last year, with the first having taken place in London in 2020 and the second in Berlin in April. On October 21, Lee therefore took to Michigan's largest city to reveal a collection that unabashedly took inspiration from the U.S., a market where the Bottega Veneta brand saw its sales increase 52% in the third quarter of this year. Discovered by Lee in 2015, the former capital of the U.S. auto industry, which has since been ravaged by industrial and financial crises, struck the designer, a fan of cars and techno music, with its similarities to the region where he grew up in the north of England, as well as to Manchester, where he completed his studies. He therefore took inspiration from Detroit's creative energy and technical innovation for his new women's and menswear collection, which he revealed at the historic Michigan Theater, first built in 1926 and now transformed into a parking lot. Approximately 240 people watched the show, around half of whom were residents of Motor City. 

Having previously redefined the Bottega Veneta image, all while still respecting its highly sophisticated identity and injecting a touch of sexy subversiveness, with his chic collections, this season the designer explored new territory by emphasizing a much more metropolitan silhouette, spotlighting denim, workwear, sporty urban pieces and several all-over white looks, including white work boots with yellow laces. Functional looks made up of voluminous parkas and blousons, shirt-jackets with pockets, and baggy pants, alternated with a series of short skirts offered tight or flared. A Marilyn dress with gaping cut-outs was worn with a pair of green sneakers channeling the brand's new favorite color. There were also knit dresses in the same shade of grass green, including some versions covered with sustainable rubber pearls or plastic shells, while others were undulated for a 3D effect. In particular, the collection spotlighted numerous technical innovations and new materials. Parkas and denim jackets, for example, were woven through with metallic threads that allowed them to be sculpted. Here a collar stretched out above the model's shoulders, there sleeves bubbled and kept themselves in place.

The designer's research into new textures ran deep. Tracksuits, for example, looked like papier mâché. Lee brought terrycloth into day-to-day styles too, as in his bathrobe-coat and a dress which was knotted at the bust, just like a bath towel. The same technical terrycloth was also used to make sandals.Finally, there was no lack of sparkle, from shimmering knitwear and sequined dresses to pantsuits in silvery or green metallic fabric that created a space-age aesthetic, as well as a range of other sparkly, varnished or translucent materials. And that's without even mentioning the new accessories, which will no doubt be a hit next year, including rubber boots in yellow or white, but also jewelry and some colorful bags. 

From the start, Lee gave his audience an ultra-inventive collection prioritizing peculiar textures that play with the borders between laid-back style and playful glamor. The label also gave itself the luxury of intermittently reproducing images from its hedonistic Spring 2020 campaign, shot by Tyrone Lebon, on some pieces. 

To mark the occasion of the runway show, the brand has inaugurated a pop-up shop in a disused fire station, at 1201 Bagley Street. This will remain open until January 16, offering a variety of products made with local partners, such as Underground Music Academy, Substudio, and Donut Shop.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Oct 26, 2021","For those brought up in Britain, 'TT' stands for 'Tourist Trophy', the toughest motorbike race in the world staged on the Isle of Man. Now, in fashion, it will stand for 'Tommy x Timberland', the latest collab from the American designer which debuts on October 26. 
Drop 1 will be a 17-piece hybrid capsule paying homage to the colorful signature styles of both brands, while the complete assortment will include apparel, footwear, accessories and, of course, boots where Tommy Hilfiger’s energetic take on Americana meets Timberland’s authentic outdoor and work aesthetic. All overlaid with the mood and zeitgeist of the ‘90s.
 
“As an iconic American brand in the outdoor arena, Timberland was a natural choice for a statement-making partnership as we look to celebrate legacy. The process has been such a creative adventure for me and a long time coming. If you look back at some of the most iconic pop culture images of the ‘90s, Tommy Hilfiger products were often paired with Timberland boots,” Tommy Hilfiger told FashionNetwork.com.Using bright yellows and softest blues, the collection includes joint logo canary-yellow splash jackets; pretty multi-colored striped shirts; oversized fleeces with elasticated trim and some great carpenters’ pants with vertical dual logos.
 
Drop 1 will be available online at Tommy.com, Timberland.com, and select Tommy Hilfiger and Timberland stores worldwide and through select wholesale partners on Tuesday.
 
“To celebrate the clash of the two brands, we fused our signature flag with the Timberland tree, into a hybrid logo that runs throughout the collection. Color was an interesting juxtaposition, from the signature Timberland wheat and orange coloring and clashing them with our American primary colors of red, white and blue – just like how consumers wore the iconic Tommy palette with their wheat Timberlands in the ‘90s,” added Lee Holman, Hilfiger's Chief Design Officer. 
A past master in the art of blending preppiness with hip-hop punch, Tommy Hilfiger even dreams up a uber-sized 'H'-logo reversible varsity jacket and elongated dusters and parkas in black nylon.
 
“Diving into our archives and reliving that optimistic, ‘anything is possible’ energy of the ‘90s along with Timberland was a great and nostalgic experience. Culture shaped our brands, and in turn we shaped the fashion landscape of the time,” added the New York-based designer. Previously, Hilfiger has partnered with the likes of Gigi Hadid, Zendaya and Lewis Hamilton.

Naturally, the collection includes Tommy’s interpretation of the legendary Timberland 6” construction boot, revamped with the designer’s iconic nautical American flag as a tongue, and finished at the side of the heel with a joint hybrid logo. It seems sure to achieve cult status. 
Added Timberland’s global creative director Christopher Raeburn, when asked his favorite: “The 6” boot. It’s a new take on the classic Timberland boot remixed with the Tommy Hilfiger DNA. Even without the logo, this boot screams Timberland and Tommy – and being built on the shoulders of these icons.”

A second capsule is in the pipeline and the two brands plan multiple digital activations designed to engage and inspire the next generation.

"Oct 25, 2021","Stella McCartney and Adidas have worked together to produce the sports giant’s first 100% vegan football boot. The Paul Pogba x Adidas by Stella McCartney Predator Freak is a limited-edition, gender-neutral shoe.The company and the designer linked with the World Cup winner and Manchester United star on the boots that they said combine the “distinct design, innovation and sustainable values of Stella McCartney with the expressive style and elite performance requirements” of Pogba.

They added that the development grew out of a conversation between Pogba and McCartney as part of Adidas’s The Huddle content series back in May 2020. Hosted during lockdown, their Huddle “not only revealed their mutual passion for fashion, sport and brand-building, but also served to sow the seeds for this pioneering football-fashion co-creation”.The boots come with a white Primeknit upper adorned with leopard and Earth Protector graphics. Adidas Demonskin rubber spikes have been calibrated by a “computer algorithm to afford improved ball control and swerve”.There’s also signature Adidas Stella McCartney detailing such as an opalescent finish and an ombré rainbow mirror metallic plate and heel logo – the first time a football boot has carried this feature.

The two models retail at €250 and €280 with a limited number available exclusively via the Adidas app now. They’ll also be at selected retailers from November 1.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Oct 20, 2021","In just a few years, sneakers have risen to become the most coveted shoes in the world, to the point of being sold at auction at premium prices. But if some models, or rare editions, are sought after the world over, tastes and colors can vary greatly across geographical regions.

While worldwide, the Adidas Yeezy Foam Runner sneakers emerged as the hottest men's product of the third quarter of 2021 -- with a 411% jump in searches, according to the Lyst platform -- this must-have shoe is nowhere to be found in the trends reported by StockX.

"Oct 15, 2021","Parfums Christian Dior has opened the Miss Dior Exhibition 12 Women Artists featuring interpretations of the fragrance in Monsieur Dior’s famed Chateau de la Colle Noire in Provence as the brand opens the designer’s home for the first time to the general public. 
Miss Dior remains the house’s most iconic fragrance, ever since Christian Dior sprayed a whole liter of the scent in the stairway and salons of Avenue Montaigne to welcome guests as they arrived to witness his debut show, the legendary New Look collection on February 12, 1947.
 
The house acquired the chateau in 2013, and after careful restoration opened it to editors and VIPs two years later. Though La Colle Noire has always held a special place in the Dior iconography, and in fashion history.The exhibition’s opening coincides with the publication of Miss Dior, A Story of Courage and Couture, by noted magazine and editor and author Justine Picardie, which focuses on the remarkable life of Christian’s youngest sister Catherine. A botanist, rose grower, muse and brave member of the French Resistance who was tortured by the SS in Paris before being sent to Ravensbruck camp, and remarkably surviving. On returning to the Gare de l’Est railway station in Paris in 1945, she was so emaciated that her big brother Christian failed to recognize her. After helping to nurse her back two health, two years later Christian would christen his first fragrance Miss Dior after Catherine. 
A latest declination of the scent Miss Dior was launched in early September with a rather magical ad campaign starring Natalie Portman, directed by Manu Cossu. Underlining how important Portman is to the house, the entire production team decamped to Australia, where Portman was filming Thor: Love and Thunder in order to shoot her in floral glory. Necessitating that the whole crew went into isolation for 15 days before the shoot began.
 
It’s a long way geographically from the Colle Noire. Yet somehow the emergence from the pandemic mirrors the revival in France after the horrors of World War Two and darks days of collaboration under the Vichy regime.
 
“Precisely because he had been through his own dark moments – Monsieur Dior’s rich family went bankrupt in the 1930s; the Depression forced him to close his art gallery; his eldest brother returned from WW1 permanently shell-shocked, his other brother ended up schizophrenic and Catherine was taken to the camps – Dior was doubly determined to celebrate beauty, freedom of expression and the independence of women. Out of darkness can sometimes come great beauty,” commented Picardie, before a book signing in La Colle Noire’s garden. 
Which is what the artists of this show achieved, using the key codes of Dior and the Miss Dior flacon – hound’s tooth; the colors pink and gray or its satin ribbon – to express their different visions. 
 
“We decided to create this exhibition Miss Dior to render homage to Dior, who imagined the scent one summer evening right here in La Colle Noire, thinking of his sister Catherine. So we thought it was the correct thing to ask these female artists to reflect on the very origin of Miss Dior right here in this special location,” explained Jerome Pulis, Parfums Christian Dior’s International Communications Director.
 
Hua Wang’s Love is a gift concentrates on the elegant satin bow in massive ceramic and resin rectangular box; while Mimosa Echard in Andréa utilized all the materials of a couture atelier – crystals, quartz, plastic beads, earrings, horsehair and even Miss Dior perfume caps - to create a quintet of transparent resin flacons in the color rose – the basis of the scent.
 Pia Maria Naeder, a former investigative TV reporter, created hand-made flacon and min Dior gown festooned with thousands of beads in a work entitled Miss Stardust; while Behan Laura Wood, a blue-haired Englishwoman in a kimono dress built a two-meter high Miss Dior Trellis Folly Sculpture in borosilicate glass and stainless steel arches in a hound’s tooth pattern.
 
“We gave the artists carte blanche. What was interesting was that they all took very different approaches to using Dior codes like, for example, hound’s tooth. Certain artists also used the personal history of Catherine Dior, who was a great resistance fighter. Such as French sculptor Ingrid Donat, who created a metal box with pink parchment inside, as a symbol of Catherine’s courage,” added Pulis.While in the south of France, the Dior team also organized the makeup for a series of TV stars at Cannes, including Ana Giradot, Vera Kolesnikova, Niels Schneider and Virginie Efira; as well as Naida Ayadi and Marco Prince, members of the jury led by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of Game of Thrones fame. The house even sponsored two awards in this festival of television series: A Dior Revelation Prize that went to Malik Gervais-Aubourg for his performance in Je Voudrais Qu’On M’Efface and the Dior Grand Prize for the best series, won by The Allegation from Germany.
 
Located 45 minutes northwest of Cannes, the chateau is a beautiful expression of Monsieur’s multiple influences – grand neo-classical, earthy Provencal and posh haute bourgeoisie. The structure began life as a sturdy postal sorting office, then became a small stone chateau, before Dior bought it in 1950 and nearly doubled its size, building a new entrance and avenue of staggered spaced poker pines to heighten the sense of distance.   
It’s a rarefied and beautiful setting, where all the artistic meditations on beauty and independence seemed very much at home.  Boasting extended views over rolling ridges, known locally as The Black Hills, hence the chateau’s name. One can find the olive tress planted by the designer; the five-hectare estate even produces its own olive oil. Christian’s symmetric 40 by 10-meter pond is home to a shoal of Japanese carp, as it was in his days. While white doves and white peacocks – with a new generation of offspring –amble in the meadows and before a the 19th-century chapel. Inside, one finds a floor in star shapes much loved by Dior, a discovery which delighted the famously superstitious designer.
 
Due to his early death aged just 52, Christian Dior only got to spend two full years in the chateau, but his spirit and the idea of the human spirit overcoming the evils of the world to imagine a finer and nobler place lives on in La Colle Noire. For lovers of fashion and beauty and the myth of Dior it really is a must-see.

"Oct 12, 2021","Alexander McQueen and Sarah Burton returned to London with a rooftop runway show at lunchtime on Tuesday, a visual fashion storm after the eerie calm of the lockdown. 
Presented within a giant custom-made transparent dome, built on the top floor of a Yellow Park parking garage in Wapping. And beneath a cumulus-blotted London sky, which was itself the initial inspiration for this Spring-Summer 2022 collection.
 
The show marked the first by the label since March 2020 in Paris, when Burton presented a series of modern-day heroines from a modish Mary Queen of Scots to Calypso in shards of faille and crystals.Since then, the house has released several quirky videos – a mudlark-mode Spring-Summer 2021 women’s collection shot on the muddiest banks of the Thames, and its Spring-Summer 2021 Escher-worthy menswear collection, filmed below the white cliffs of New Haven. 
 
“We work in a studio in Clerkenwell, and outside there is a balcony where we constantly see the sky, either rain, storm or sun. Recently we went into the mud of the Thames and this time I looked to the sky, where the girls were storm chasers. I like the idea that you don’t know what the day is going to bring so you have to be brave and deal with it,” explained Burton post-show.
 
The impact heightened by what the French call un casting sauvage, a series of arty and punky indie gals that marched along with Naomi Campbell who appeared in a strapless corset dress under a strict jacket dripping with crystals for the final look.
 
All appearing out of a hidden staircase, the first model touring the circular pine-wood catwalk in a double-breasted wool coat with ballooned-up mutton-chop sleeves. Cut with a deep gorge, the better to display a huge black thistle tattoo that marched up her neck.  
Setting the scene after a 30-minute roaring seaside storm soundtrack as guests took their seats.
 
Burton loosened up her silhouette this season, showing zippered dresses, with multiple gathers in daybreak cloud, blue sky or nightfall cloud prints.
 
She jumped back and forth between her power-shouldered jackets paired with peg-leg pants. And employed one of her favorite visual puns – the Janus coat – a two-faced garment in double-breasted Prince of Wales at the front, stone poly faille with a bustle at the back.
 
Though her single most beautiful silhouette was probably a giant shirt dress like a vertical parachute that billowed in front of the giant urban view. A vista that seem to capture all the energy and construction of the UK capital – east towards Tobacco Docks and Greenwich, west to St Paul’s Cathedral and all the soaring new skyscrapers; The Shard, the Cheesegrater and the Gherkin.
 
“I loved the collection, and kept on ticking off in my head all the looks I wanted. That one, this one too, and that one as well!” laughed Game of Thrones star Emilia Clark, as she and Vanessa Kirby of The Crown formed a huddle with Burton backstage. Elsewhere in the front row, Kosar Ali of The Rocks fame looked stunning in a curly leather McQueen bomber, while Daphne Guinness dished endlessly with Irish hatter Philip Treacy. 
 
A show in a giant bubble, though not a Covid support bubble, as the collection looked forward optimistically past the darkest days of the pandemic. All building to a great finale of sequined shard rain embroidered pencil dresses – glamour-punk couture created with extreme dexterity; and several black jackets with tulle trim, finished in crystal raindrop patterns.
 
Before the designer took her bow, amid intense applause, the sun staying just enough behind the clouds to prevent the giant dome overheating.
 
“Look at Sarah, no one tells her what to do. She decides everything, and even controls the weather!” enthused Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering, which controls the house of McQueen along with Gucci, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent. 
 
Pinault stressed that Kering left any decisions on where and when brands show to each and every marque. Several Kering houses began skipping established running seasons in recent years, causing more than a little polemic within the industry.  
“Yes, we are returning to the runway, but each brand in its own way. So Bottega will next go to Detroit, and Saint Laurent is off to Los Angeles. This is never decided on the corporate level,” explained Pinault.
 
How was business, one enquired, with Kering due to announce figures next week?
 
“We have been doing well thanks to China and North America. China where we knew they had come out of the lockdown much sooner than everyone. And, what has surprised us, America, where the recovery has been much quicker than expected. In Europe things are much different, but as there are no tourists that is only to be expected,” said Pinault, who for once didn't have far to come for a Kering runway show. A resident of London, he lives half an hour north in Hampstead.

"Oct 11, 2021","Ever since it opened during Paris Fashion Week, fashionistas, fans and mere tourists have been chorusing on social media that the retrospective Thierry Mugler: Couturissime inside the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris is essential viewing. We consider why that is absolutely right.Mugler was one of the leaders of a small group of Paris-based designers known as the créateurs de mode, a small highly talented gang who revolutionized French fashion in the early 1970s, paving the way for an entire generation to launch their own brands.  As Thierry Mugler: Couturissime, staged until April 24, 2022, inside the Musée des Arts Décoratifs explains carefully.

Born in 1948 Strasbourg, Mugler dreamed of being a dancer and even joined a ballet corps before moving to Paris aged 20. There he worked in a hipster boutique before working as a freelance designer and launching his first marque, Café de Paris, in 1973.  The same year, a group of American designers – including Halston, Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta - outperformed local French stars like Yves Saint Laurent and Hubert Givenchy in the legendary Battle of the Designers in Chateau de Versailles thanks to superior production techniques. An event chronicled by Netflix in its recent Halston series.A year later, Mugler created his eponymously named brand and from the beginning staged collection spectacles with his instantly recognizable broad-shouldered superwoman silhouette; and his signature cartoonish Catwoman-meets-Barbarella heroines.

By 1984, when he staged his 10th anniversary show, Mugler organized a super-show where the public could buy tickets, and 6,000 people crammed into the Zenith in a show worthy of Cecil B. DeMille. That same year, President Mitterrand would receive the créateurs in the Elysees Palace and publicly proclaim that fashion was an art.One indication of Thierry’s VIP fandom is the list of individuals or estates who contributed images and photographs to the retrospective – Lady Gaga, Madonna, Celine Dion, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Karl Lagerfeld, Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton, David LaChapelle, Joey Arias, Ellen Von Unwerth, Gisele Bundchen and Arthur Elgort among over a half century of generous friends.

However, the heart of the exhibition comes after 1992 when Thierry had created the global perfume hit 'Angel' with Clarins, allowing him even more financial free rein to indulge in his greatest fantasies. Like his remarkable period of mechanical inspirations like Cadillacs and Harley Davidsons in his final uber-luxe ready-to-wear shows, brilliantly captured in George Michael famous rock video Too Funky. The video in the exhibitions features Thierry’s edit and not George’s, in one of the many creative disputes that characterized his dramatic career. His erratic personality running battles with Women’s Wear Daily didn’t help his business much either. Mugler was always a curious mixture of gentlemanly bourgeois, like the city where he was born, and late-night after-hours party-animal supreme.But as someone who attended the original Too Funky live show inside the Palais de Tokyo as the young editor, the sense of revolutionary excitement and of fashion tearing down a moralistic ancient regime was tremendously exciting. A rare moment that will probably never be repeated in fashion.

However, the high point of the exhibition are two later and utterly compelling collections, Les Insectes of 1996, with biological surrealism, and La Chimère in 1997, with its incarnations of fantasy regal beauty like the Tonkinoise empress red velvet suit. Best of all, the absolutely astounding La Chimère gown in scales, feathers and crystals, worn famously by Yasmin Le Bon, as a bio-morphic goddess that predates and humbles the best efforts of computer-generated technology.

The expo also presents multiple examples of Mugler’s own photography – most memorably his early photos of Amazonian blonde beauties perched precariously on Stalinist gothic buildings in Moscow, at a time when it was almost impossible to visit the Soviet Union. And, intriguingly, of his design for a darkly surrealist version of Macbeth, presented with a half-dozen costumes and a fantastic series of holograms.

Like many other important designers, from Coco Chanel to Jean-Paul Gaultier, Mugler’s fashion house was eventually swallowed up by the owner of his perfume license. Though like those two colleagues he also wrote an indelible chapter in fashion history, which this show brilliantly encapsulates.

If you are in Paris over the next six months, do not miss it.

"Oct 10, 2021","From the boutiques of Christian Dior to royal wedding favours, jute is growing in popularity worldwide as demand for alternatives to plastic soars, with experts predicting the bag industry alone will be worth more than $3 billion by 2024.India is desperate to capitalise on this consumer shift and seize the opportunity to revive its flagging industry, expanding it from sacks and gunny bags to fashion.

Also known as sack cloth, hessian, or burlap, the fibre is hailed by environmentalists because growing it can help with carbon capture, and it uses less natural resources than cotton.""One hectare of jute plant can soak up to nearly 15 tonnes of carbon-dioxide and discharge 11 tonnes of oxygen during a season, thereby reducing greenhouse effects,"" estimated Swati Singh Sambyal, a sustainability and circular economy expert based in New Delhi.

She added that production takes about only four months and requires ""minimal water and fertiliser"" compared to cotton.

During British rule, the jute industry was a key part of India's economy and the fabric was exported worldwide but by the 1990s it was struggling, unable to compete with cheaper synthetic substitutes and lower production costs of farmers in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Today India is trying to promote jute as a fabric for a sustainable future, with the government issuing a mandate that all grains and 20 percent of sugar should be packed in jute sacks.

Leading homegrown designers such as Ashish Soni and Pawan Aswani also use jute blends for their fashion lines.

But critics warn the country's rundown mills and outdated farming practices do not match up with such grand ambitions.

- Billion dollar industry -

""India can cater to global demand but for that two things are needed: upgrading the skills of the people...to produce different types of products and upgrading the machinery,"" said Gouranga Kar, who heads the Central Research Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres.

There are around 70 jute factories in West Bengal state, some of which were set up in the 19th century mainly to produce coarse sacks for packing coffee and food grains, but there has been little change to machinery and production methods since.

At Meghna Jute Mills hundreds of barefoot workers labour in a vast dingy hall covered in fine, fibrous dust across eight-hour shifts, 24 hours a day.

""Jute has a potentially huge international market"" said company president Supriya Das, as noisy machines rolled out long strands of shimmery yarn behind him.

""If the machines are high-tech we can produce good yarn. For diversified end use, the quality of the fibre has to improve. The industry won't be viable unless we introduce value-added products like decorative items and rugs.""

Nearly all of the world's jute is grown in this region or in Bangladesh, because of the conducive humid climate and availability of cheap labour.

According to a recent report by Research and Markets, the global jute bag market reached a value of $2.07 billion in 2020 and is projected to touch $3.1 billion by 2024 as consumers look for alternatives to single use plastic.

The material's appeal has been boosted by brands such as Dior making jute sandals and stars such as the Duchess of Sussex wearing jute footwear and using hessian gift bags for guests attending her wedding to Prince Harry.

- Drowning in plastic pollution -

Kar said India should seize the opportunity to invest in its industry and make diverse jute-based products such as rugs, lamps, shoes and shopping bags.

India's scientists have developed high yielding varieties of jute to tap this renewed interest, Kar explained, but unskilled labour and outdated farming practices meant this had yet to translate into economic returns.

""This is a major cause of concern for us,"" he added.

The coronavirus pandemic has also thwarted hopes of restoring the lost glory of the industry -- several mills have shut down and lockdowns have caused labour and raw material shortages.

Environmentalists insist jute has vast economic and green potential, particularly as consumers voice concerns about fast fashion and more countries introduce legislation to ban single-use plastic.

Every part of the jute plant can be used: the outer layer for the fibre, the woody stem for paper pulp, and the leaves can be cooked and eaten, Sambyal explained.

The UN Environment Programme has said the planet is ""drowning in plastic pollution"", with about 300 million tonnes of plastic waste produced every year.

India generates 3.3 million metric tonnes of plastic waste annually, according to a report in 2018-19 by the Central Pollution Control Board.

Back at Meghna Mills, factory bosses are hopeful that if authorities invest, they can rebrand and reboot jute for the 21st century.

Das said: ""Jute has a great future. It can bring a lot of valuable foreign exchange to the country so the government must focus on this sector.""

"Oct 8, 2021","There seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. As sales are on the rise and people are returning to normality after nearly two years in the grip of the pandemic, designers are letting rip. Their Spring/Summer 2022 collections are varied and colourful, a melange of eras featuring a 1990s and 2000s vibe combined with an infusion of lightness and joy that dips decidedly in the 1960s.

The women’s ready-to-wear collections that marked the come-back of physical shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris, between September 7 and October 5 2021, showcased a kaleidoscope of sensations, colours and styles, emphasising an unabashed yearning for fun through an abundance of super summery, ultra sexy looks.1) Mini-skirt suits 

Men’s-style suits are still an essential item in women’s wardrobes, as shown by the vigorous return of the suit. Especially combined with short skirts and even miniskirts, often with a 1960s vibe. Skirts reached just above the knee at Moschino, Chanel, Michael Kors and Christian Dior, the latter presenting a series of fun suits in bright colours. Miuccia Prada for Miu Miu was even more drastic, shortening the skirt to just under the buttocks with a savage slash of the knife.2) Gingham

Still steeped in a 1960s mood, designers have rediscovered gingham fabrics, with their deliciously retro small checks in pink, light green, orange, daffodil yellow and black. Michael Kors presented classic mini-check patterns in Vichy pink or black, while Carolina Herrera, Luisa Spagnoli, Prabal Gurung and MSGM went for larger checks to bolster volume.3) Snipped by scissors

Rather than a scalpel, designers have wielded good old-fashioned scissors with sadistic satisfaction this season, creating slits, gaps, notches, tears and more. As seen in drilled trousers, perforated coats, open-work dresses, macramé outfits and fishnet sets. They have played with transparencies and added plenty of slashes, manhandling garments and forcing them to become lightweight, to slip off the shoulders, leave the back bare and uncover the hips. Clothes reveal the body beneath with openings large and small, positioned on the belly or across the breasts. Some of the silhouettes have a lacerated look, others feature geometric asymmetries.4) Briefs/underwear peeping over trousers

A regular menswear feature in the last few seasons, sagging, low-waisted trousers that reveal the underwear have now become a look that women too like to flaunt, as seen at Boss and Coach, among others. And this despite the controversy around the trompe-l’œil joggers by Balenciaga, accused of cultural appropriation, which made news headlines recently. On the womenswear catwalks, this look has taken on a sexier, more subtle twist. It was no longer plain underwear that peeped over the trousers, but g-strings (as at Act N°1 and Givenchy) or lace briefs, as at Dolce & Gabbana. At Miu Miu, discreet flesh-coloured briefs could be glimpsed beneath a skirt.5) Skin-tight bodysuits 

The pandemic and related lockdowns have had a definitive impact on people's wardrobes, prompting designers to create comfortable, versatile clothes. Stretchy, body-contouring fabrics are extremely popular, as shown by the success of the skin-tight body-suit: ultra chic at Saint Laurent and AZ Factory, sexy at Burberry, made in printed fabrics at Lanvin, Marine Serre and Weinsanto. The top part of the body-suit comes in a variety of shapes (draped, corset-style, with braces), while the bottom part can take the form of a cyclist's bib-shorts.
 6) Bandeau bras 

Skin-baring tops were already highly popular last summer. The trend is here to stay. Jackets are worn over a bare torso, with just a bra or a fabric band, ideally rather thin. This is the leading look for next summer, seen in virtually all collections. Sporting a bandeau bra that matches the suit is a must. In leopard print at Cavalli, lace at Marras, or in cotton, leather and even latex. Skimpy like a bikini top, it can be clearly glimpsed underneath a sheer tunic dress. Absolutely ubiquitous, it is often worn over a jacket, dress or blouse, as an essential accessory to affirm one’s femininity.
 7) The wrap top

A garment typical of the world of ballet, from which designers have drawn extensively, with tulle details and tutu dresses, the wrap top is enjoying a new lease of life. Plunging necklines are trending, and this kind of cardigan wrapped around the bust, often fastened with long interwoven laces, has been reinterpreted by designers in sportier, sexier fashion, more like a mini bra-top. Sleeveless and made in body-hugging fabrics, like those used for bras, it is worn with a bare belly under a jacket, or over a chest-clinging dress.8) The colour violet 

Colours are definitely back in the summer 2022 season. Monochrome total looks are very much the order of the day, featuring intense, bright, vibrant hues, among which violet, at once chic and aristocratic, has pride of place. It is featured in all its shades, from lilac to lavender, mauve and purple, in a wide variety of combinations, from the freshest, lightest hues to darker tones.9) Bare shoulders 

Shoulders are revealed thanks to rounded openings in jackets and dresses, and to sleeves that glide down the arms. Bardot-style scoop necks are especially popular. With necklines that lay bare the neck and shoulders, frilled dresses and tops with drop-down sleeves will be next summer’s must-have, uber-wearable items. A clear example of the sensual, romantic and summery mood prevailing on the catwalks, especially given the plethora of frilled outfits. Brigitte Bardot’s unique style has visibly inspired designers, resulting in a spate of country-girl dresses, asymmetric boho blouses and gingham outfits. 
10) Platform shoes

Thick wedge soles and chunky platforms, from the top of which one can strut and gain height, continue to be hugely desirable. Boots are still popular and continue to be a feature, but maxi wedge sandals have been a recent catwalk hit. Top of the charts was GCDS, which dared to present 25 cm heels! Thick soles, to stay firmly grounded and especially to avoid going unnoticed, seem to be a sure bet for summer 2022.

"Oct 7, 2021","The international runway season ended this week after four weeks of shows in four fashion capitals. This season, we pick the 12 most important collections seen on live catwalk shows in Europe, since foreign editors were unable to attend New York. AZ FactoryThe high point of the season, even if it was the last show, was 45 designers paying homage to the late, great Alber Elbaz, in a group show that left many in tears. Rarely has such a demanding and competitive industry as fashion come together so movingly to show their respect to a much-missed colleague, and true design great. Plus, a second collection made by Alber’s studio team for AZ Factory was much applauded – suggesting there can be a bright future for Elbaz’ fledgling house.LoeweOverwhelmingly, as one left the latest Loewe show, staged in a riding arena with the Garde Republicaine in Paris, one heard the most positive acclaim of any collection. From the metal sculpture tetrahedron dresses to the brilliant high heels on inverted roses or fried eggs, this was the most thought-provoking show of the season.
 BalenciagaHad to be the event of the season, as Demna Gvasalia upstaged everyone, even the Met Gala, with his Red Carpet show, and Simpsons fashion-victim video. Though the collection was also a vital bellwether - that black is back again.
 Yohji YamamotoA purist expression of artistic draping by a master designer aged 77, who is still breaking new ground with ravishing dresses that swaddled his cast intricately. And, after being deluged by color on Instagram for the past half-decade, this almost entirely black collection felt refreshing, and makes everyone who wears it look thinner.
 Versace marries FendiIn an era defined by collabs and link-ups, this was the biggest ever attempted by two Italian brands. The engagement was kept top secret. And the resulting marriage of the double-'F' monogram and Versace’s Grecian friezes in a series of mini dresses and cocktails was pretty sensational.
 RokhIt felt like a coming-of-age moment for Rok Hwang, the Korean-born but London based LVMH 2018 Special Prize winner. Thanks to his considerable talent, this was the most elegant, and wearable, expression of a key trend in fashion – delicate deconstruction.  
 Del CoreIn a season of much merchandising mode, it was refreshing to see a true avant-garde collection by a born couturier and courageous rebel. Bio-morphic gowns; Southern-Belle-on-the-rampage dresses and tropical fauna fantasy shapes in a great show by Daniel Del Core, a Germano-Italian who used to dress VIPs for Gucci.
 Giambattista ValliValli’s youngest, coolest and most complete collection, in a charming post-Covid ode to purist beauty. Reduced shapes, higher hems, crystals excess and great volumes – ladylike yet sexy.
 Shang Xia After a decade of competent Chinese luxury from this brand, its new owners Exor, a holding of the Agnelli clan, Italy’s equivalent of a royal family, hired Yang Li as designer. He quietly hit a home run with his hybrid collection, blending the lofty nobility of the Middle Kingdom, the pure colors of Paris and the urbane energy of London.
 Alberta FerrettiWe never thought we’d put Alberta in our Top 12, but there you go. Sculpted airy dresses and tops in gathered chiffon held together by semi-precious stones, and the best examples of crocheted chic, the material of the season. Plus, influencer heaven in the front row, as the house’s much-loved communications chief Salvo Nicosia worked his magic.
 
 Simone RochaAlmost last but very much not least, probably the single most beautiful collection of all from Simone Rocha. Her experimental romanticism, deconstructed jackets and trenches and finishes of oversized pearls, satin strips and embroidered coral was unforgettable. Amid a crazy fashion show schedule, a moment of grace in London’s old medieval church.
 Labrum of LondonDespite five years of bitter Brexit, London still retains a unique ability to surprise with its cross-cultural pollination and multi-ethnic energy. Like this brilliantly staged show by Foday Dumbuya, the man behind the Olympic uniforms of Sierra Leone. His dashing diaspora meeting of West African immigrant style and British tailoring presented before Balimaya Project, a 13-piece brass band that blends Fela Kuti and funk, had more energy that any show anywhere.

"Oct 6, 2021","One must-see community in Paris Fashion Week is Sphere, a combination of showroom, presentation space and video display of vital young talents that present in the French Capital – especially this year, with a vintage crop.

Backed by the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, DEFI, a state-sponsored fund for start-ups in fashion, and L'Oreal, Sphere is an intelligent incubator and platform in that it accompanies its fledgling brands through the tricky early years while giving them free rein to express their ideas.

We caught up with several talent young creators in this year’s edition to see in which direction Sphere was accompanying them. Each appeared in the Sphere space in Palais de Tokyo, are visible on the FHCM platform and will be represented by happening wholesale fashion platform The New Black.Benjamin BenmoyalNo one could fault Benjamin Benmoyal for lack of timing. The Paris-based but Israeli-born designer flew to the Canary Islands to shoot his collection video, just weeks before the volcano exploded on the archipelago’s most western island, La Palma.

A graduate of Central St Martins in London, and an alumni of such diverse houses as Alexander McQueen and Hermès, Benmoyal has always trodden a unique path. His signature raw material is used video cassette tapes. A handy source seeing as the Internet has rendered millions of cassettes obsolescent.His cast emoting languidly around the island, shot away from tourist centers in quiet towns and tiny harbors, in a cute and quirky video directed by Raquel San Nicolas. Attired in white poplin dresses with striped inlay; white jean jackets sewn over ethnic woven zig sag mini dresses; and some really great grandfather shirt cocktails – everything with frayed and ragged hems.

His stockmen boasting giant cylindrical hats, a spoof on Hasidic shtreimel fur hats. “Israel recently passed a law banning fur in the whole country, except they made an exception for Hasidics. This is my way of saying how cray I find that decision,” shrugged the designer.Thebe Magugu, the family manHe has always been a family man, has Thebe Magugu, who staged a beautiful presentation at Sphere, with looks on Stockmann mannequins posed before life-sized photos of his extended family, shot over multiple generations.  When one editor asked if a young man in a photo might be his nephew, the South African designer smiled and replied: “Actually he is my uncle. We took that photo a while ago!”

Magugu even included mini photos of his grandmother as highlights on an elegant striped monogram shirt with contrasting white collar and cuffs. While a mixed material dress in mock paisley featuring his hugging couple logo, done with plissé panels, was very cool. The same logo appearing as buckles on musketeers’ boots. Also impressing  were his architectural photo print plissé skirts worn with cut-out shoulder knit tops.

The images also capture how gracefully the Magugu clan lived their lives despite the immense hardships and divisions caused by apartheid in South Africa. Speaking in several African languages, in a subtitled video, one older lady remarks, “sometimes I feel like everyone in the 'hood. You cannot escape (it).”

The family atmosphere was a far cry from a previous collection video of warring Amazons in a cinema of violence fashion flick by Thebe.

“I guess the very violence of the culture in which I live comes out when I express myself,” commented the 2019 LVMH Prize winner, who was a busy man in Paris. Sitting front row at Loewe and Acne Studio shows, and attending the Alber Elbaz memorial show, for which he created a creamy white recycled dress topped by the most beautiful white ostrich feather hat by fellow South African, milliner Crystal Birch.Germanier’s gutsy geniusOne rather genius young talent is the very out there Kevin Germanier, who showed recycled materials to the max. The original Kevin was an Irish monk who founded Glendalough south of Dublin. It still has the Emerald Isle’s most beautiful ancient tower. This Kevin is a wildly creative individual who dreams up techy biomorphic clothes and armor.

Made in recycled beads and plastic bottles and fashioned into plastic body stockings; taut bodices; outlandish cocktail party dresses and natty minaudiere bags. All made in exploding abstract patterns and what look like florals deformed by biological warfare. Think a slimmed down Leigh Bowery, with sex appeal.

“I think my parents gave me the name Kevin so I would be a big strong straight man. But that did not quite work out,” giggled Germanier. They did definitely get a courageous son – since Kevin is definitely the zaniest and bravest young talent to emerge in Paris this season.

"Oct 6, 2021","The fashion industry bade farewell on Tuesday night to Alber Elbaz in exactly the way he would have wanted, with a legendary runway show.
 
Not just a few, but 45 of his fellow designers created homages to the late great Elbaz, bringing down the curtain on Paris Fashion Week as its last show this season.“Alber would have been incredibly honored to have been surrounded by his peers, colleagues, collaborators, friends and family. It would have brought him tears of joy and happiness,” said his long-time partner Alex Koo.
 
The idea of the show came from the Théâtre de la Mode, when 60 French couturiers and artists in 1945 sent doll-sized mannequins – made the during the war - on a world tour, to help provide funds for WW2 survivors.Entitled 'Love Brings Love', the joint show was staged inside the Carreau du Temple, with bus stops nearby all featuring posters for the event. Underlining the respect in which he was held both France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo – who recently announced her candidacy to run for president against Emmanuel Macron next year - both sat front row, amid two score of designers.  
And almost as many CEOs – François-Henri Pinault; Diego della Valle; Sidney Toledano; Marc and Manuel Puig; Philippe Fortunato of the fashion division of Richemont, which bankrolled Elbaz’ indie fashion house AZ Factory; and Ralph Toledano, the chairman of Victoria Beckham, and the man who discovered Elbaz, and gave him his first job as creative director of Guy Laroche. Close by, Koo sat with Demi Moore and daughter Scout Willis, alongside several of Elbaz’ sisters.
 
After a long series of embraces and greetings, where many designers got to meet each other for the first time, this unique show began one-hour late.
 
Somehow each designer captured something of the essence of the multi-faceted Elbaz – Demna Gvasalia with a giant pink cape his courageous use of volume. Olivier Rousteing his self-deprecating sense of humor with grand t-shirt with side bow featuring a cartoon self-portrait of Alber, finished with fabric flower mutton-chop sleeves. 
Riccardo Tisci, whose fluid silk column evoked Elbaz’ mastery of draping, while Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino with a giant purple faille gown recalled Alber’s love of grandeur.
 
“He was the most unselfish human being that I have ever met and his generosity was also part of the way he approached fashion,” wrote Piccioli, in a finely illustrated book featuring all of the sketches of outfits in this show.
 
Many referenced Elbaz’ ever-present bow-ties; most handsomely Thom Browne, who reinvented his gray suit with enormous bows, while Simone Rocha’s look was one giant bow-tie gown.
 
When he died in April, there was an overpowering expression of loss from the fashion industry, when Elbaz' generous spirit was much admired. Jean-Paul Gaultier’s cocktail dresses was a series of hearts, with fabric pouring out of each one almost in tears.
 
Others to have participated included Pieter Mulier, Sarah Burton, Daniel Lee, Charaf Tajer, Gabriela Hearst, Christopher John Rogers, Dries Van Noten, Guo Pei, Nadège Vanhée-Cybulski, Iris Van Herpen, Rosie Assoulin, Chitose Abe, Daniel Roseberry, Simone Rocha, Stella McCartney, Thebe Magugu, Tomo Koizumi, Donatella Versace, Guram Gvasalia, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler, Grace Wales Bonner and Glenn Martens. 
After the collective show, the studio of AZ Factory presented an homage collection to Alber, which was in many ways the key moment. Precisely because this collection was so strong and coherent, there was an immediate sense that Elbaz’ brand does have a future without him. 
 
As the last AZ Factory model appeared, the giant backdrop was illuminated on three levels, the entire cast danced to Elbaz’ signature finale song, 'Love Train' by the O’Jays.
 
“I recall Ralph (Toledano) calling me back in the 90s and explaining he had found this great young designer for Guy Laroche from Casablanca. Which is where he and I are from. And in those days, designers from Morocco didn’t get to run famous Paris fashion houses. But Alber did and immediately he was great,” recalled Sidney Toledano.
 
After a stint at Saint Laurent, Elbaz would go on to achieve his greatest success at Lanvin. Where after a decade and a half he was fired unceremoniously in 2015. However, Alber, always known for his huge heart, would surely have been pleased to see his eventual successor at Lanvin, Bruno Sialelli contributing so elegantly to this farewell. 
 
With a beautiful white gown whose elongated train featured a giant photo of Elbaz floating like sailing boat across the space in moving pools of light.

"Oct 6, 2021","An immense white canvas covered the stairs of the Palais de Tokyo, protecting the terrain set aside for the first runway show by Lacoste since the start of the pandemic from the rain that had been beating down on the French capital for the last few hours. For its catwalk comeback, the French brand founded by René Lacoste in 1933 paid tribute to its origins, creating an immaculate white space resembling a a tennis court, complete with tiered seating for the guests and an intensely green net that cut the catwalk in half. The sound of tennis rallies that greeted the show's attendees right up until the start of the show mixed with the usual hubbub of the skaters that frequent the modern art museum's esplanade, who, willingly or otherwise, were all dressed specially for the event, in sky blue shirts with crocodile logos. A surprising look made up of a powder pink, waterproof, knee-length skirt and a techy green bandeau top with straps opened proceedings, setting the tone for the 50 looks to come. Futuristic sunglasses, long jacquard logo socks paired with sandals, and visors added the house's classic touch. British designer Louise Trotter, who has served as the brand's creative director since 2018, seemed to have it clear in her mind that her coed collection for Spring/Summer 2022 should be full of youthful references to the streets of Paris, all without losing sight of the Lacoste DNA. 

Looks with sporty cuts and touches of streetwear were followed by wide, high-waisted, knee-length pants mixing boxing and basketball influences, worn with tight knitted V-neck sweater vests, overlapping oversized shirts, loose double-breasted blazers or even with elegant and lightly transparent polos in shades of blue and burgundy. These hues were part of the summery color scheme chosen for the collection, alongside Lacoste's classic dark green, which notably appeared in a pant-and-sports-jacket ensemble featuring a print repeating the brand's name. Camel, red, sky blue and black rounded out the palette, while the collection's more urban details brought in elements of reflective yellow and orange through trims, shoes and accessories. Sport culture codes were repeated almost obsessively, creating an athletic uniform for everyday summer life in the city. This urban inspiration was also channeled into functional clothing such as rain jackets and light waterproof pieces adapted for cycling. Some raincoats were even comfortably rolled over the techy satchels worn by the models. 

Tennis skirts were reinterpreted in rubber, and technical knits were incorporated into striped dresses and miniscule shorts, while neoprene was borrowed from diving gear to become the material of choice for tops and Teddy jackets. In this fusion of sports beyond the tennis court, NBA stylings took over looks with short pants and sleeveless tops, both in light, perforated fabric.As for the MF Brands-owned label's emblematic knitted V-neck jersey, it was reinterpreted in the Trotter style, characterized by a large, frayed crocodile, presented here in intense fluorescent yellow. The show underlined the collection's practical aspect in its conclusion, closing with a series of parachute-cut nylon outerwear pieces, worn with diagonal XXL backpacks finished with knotted ropes. 

Throughout the show, the models gradually took position along the upper tiers of the seating, forming rows behind the audience, which included actors Noah Schnapp, from Stranger Things, and Madelyne Cline, star of Outer Banks. Finally, at the show's close, the entire cast flooded into the center of the runway, as though coming together at the end of a match. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 5, 2021","Self-editing, a talent few designers are blessed with, which is why they employ stylists to help hone their visions, was the key to the latest Miu Miu collection staged Tuesday, the final day of Paris Fashion Week.
 For, besides being a great designer, Miuccia Prada is possibly the best editor of her own ideas in fashion. That much was clear in this contemporary statement from Miu Miu, on how to dress with classic style without looking boring.
 
Most of the actual selection of clothes were rather traditional Miu Miu, but all presented in a novel ensemble. What the French call le bon dosage.Her key choice of material was military khaki, seen in the opening looks of flat front wide-legged pants, and colonial shorts cut off at the knee, with the snags of the interior lining visible. 
There appeared to be a logo visible in every look; the chest of button-down preppy shirts; the tongues of deliberately frayed white running sneakers; on buckles of kitten heel shoes or the bands of underwear peeking out above pleated skirts. Mannish elements throughout the show, with suede college bombers; V-neck campus cashmere sweaters and nerdy gray socks.
 
However, the Miu Miu gal will always be the naughtier younger sister of the Prada princess. And not afraid to flaunt a good figure while she’s got one. So, for next spring she will step out in white shirts or Aran cable sweaters cut horizontally in half, the better to show off her abdomen; and minis that barely covered the crotch.
 
Like in her Prada collection in Milan, made with cohort Raf Simons, she showed faded leather looks – most memorably the scrunched up black leather blazers or worn rawhide western jackets, paired with low-waist pleated skirts. 
In a novel move, Miuccia worked with Moroccan artist Meriem Bennani, presenting a video projected in a series of binocular shaped screens, on the side of the circular catwalk inside the modernist Palais d’Iena in Paris' 16th arrondissement. As if the audience was someone spying on Bennani’s mini fashion flick. Images of this work even appeared on Miu Miu’s online platform.

At one stage, the ladylike characters discuss how to get a bottom lift. 
 
“So why do they get their ass done?” one enquires. “They take fat from the thighs and inject it in the butt,” her friend replies. “Ok, so it’s halal!” adds a third to much laughter. 
Though, quite frankly, it was hard to understand the connection between the video and the collection. Or, indeed, the point of the link-up by Miuccia, who has long been on record as distaining other designers' never-ending partnerships with fine artists.
 
Last week in Milan, a masked Signora Prada declined to discuss her collection with editors, pleading fear of Covid. This time she didn’t even come out from the backstage, highly unusual for such a normally self-confident individual.
 
All told, an inventive collection of artful rearrangement, ideal for sexy intellectuals. Even if it felt like a designer playing far too far within her own game. Definitely not a vintage show.

"Oct 4, 2021","If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again. Which is what’s happened at Schiaparelli, where designer Daniel Roseberry has hit a sweet spot between polished, perverse and punchy.The house has been through several designers and CEOs since Italian luxury entrepreneur Diego della Valle bought control of the storied marque a decade and half ago. Now, under Roseberry it’s grown to become an absolutely must-see collection again in Paris.
 
No runway show this season but a video and presentation inside its gilded third floor showroom and lounge at 21 Place Vendome, looking onto the Ritz Hotel.“People can get lots of very good fashion in many houses. What I believe they look for in Schiaparelli is that sense of twisted luxury,” explained Daniel Roseberry, as he showed guests his Spring/ Summer 2022 collection from the house.
 
“When I make a blazer with nipple buttons everyone goes for that; and not the blazer with classic buttons. That’s just the way it is,” chuckled the American designer, behind a black mask.Guests were greeted in the first of a series of salons by a fantastic series of accessories – from diabolic golden finger caps to silver minaudieres with evil eyes made of crystal eyebrows and pearl eye lashes; to clutches with golden ear clasps – all in gold, silver and pearls. While his cut out one-third-of-a-face pendants – nose, one eye and a half a forehead with crystal model – were something else.
 
The dashing darkness continues in ready-to-wear where snug, saddle-stitched black wool suits or a micro patent leather blazers were finished with nose clasps and ear buckles. One could not help noticing the black-and-white target leather boobs on a leather puffer. Another beautiful blazer had one lapel trimmed with a golden Schiaparelli tape measure. Several of the 20 Stockmann models even wore Elsa Schiaparelli’s interpretation of an upturned doge hat.Just like the founder who dressed everyone from Mae West and Zsa Zsa Gabor to Wallis Simpson and Daisy Fellowes, Roseberry has attired contemporary icons like Lady Gaga, Michelle Obama and Beyoncé.
 
One can only imagine the civil war that will erupt between celebrity stylists as they fight to be the first to get their hands on two remarkable new silver sequined jackets emblazoned with bullion facial features – supreme statements of surrealist chic. 
 
A noted multi-task man, Roseberry even shot the 4.20 look-book video. Blessed with truly fertile imagination, Daniel however prefers a lower-key existence than Elsa. Not for him the clubs of Ibiza and Mykonos favored by so many designers. He spent one week this summer on a remote Swedish island by himself. 
 
“Being in a log cabin without running water was actually pretty refreshing for the mind,” he mused.Roseberry has also injected dashes of humor, like the marvelous white dressing gown embroidered in black eyes and trimmed with tassels and the logo Schiaparelli Hotel.
 
“That was inspired by a photo in a dressing gown of Marlene Dietrich, a great friend of Schiaparelli,” explained the designer. Who cautioned that there’s no plans to build a Schiaparelli Hotel.
 
However, the brand will open its first foreign store, a new shop within the world’s most prestigious department store, Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue. 
 
That will take place on October 12, as della Valle’s long and patient wait to restore Schiaparelli to pinnacle of the fashion hierarchy reaches a new stage.

"Oct 4, 2021","An imposing oval structure radiating a blinding white light greeted guests at the center of the Paris La Défense Arena, the immense stadium in western Paris that usually serves as the venue for Racing 92 rugby games and major music concerts from bands including The Rolling Stones. On this occasion, however, it was fashion house Givenchy's turn to play host, as it celebrated the first physical runway and the third ready-to-wear collection from creative director Matthew Williams. The brand bet big on the event, which took place on the night of Sunday, October 3, revealing its latest collection on an almost cosmic catwalk, positioned at the end of of a long corridor flanked by dozens of neatly lined-up black-clad men, who, immersed in the monumental darkness of the stadium, invited attendees into a show whose dystopic staging had echoes of the latest Netflix hit, Squid Game. The American designer, who has also led his own brand, 1017 Alyx 9SM, since 2015, did what many had been expecting, offering up a dark collection with Gothic touches and the characteristic couture sparkle of the fashion house founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952, alongside a good dose of scene-stealing accessories. It was all adapted to the wardrobe of a modern and subversive customer, more au fait with electronic music festivals and the ostentation of rap icons than with the film premiere red carpets and royal weddings frequented by wearers of pieces made by Williams' predecessor, British designer Clare Waight Keller. 

This change of tone could already be seen in his previous collections, where one could pick out the odd echo of the period when Riccardo Tisci led creative direction at the house, and was also reflected in the selection of VIPs occupying the front row at Williams' cosmic show: from a hooded Tyga and media favorite Offset, both escorted by hip-hop entourages, to futuristic Spanish DJ Sita Abellán, via French stars Camélia Jordana and Leïla Bekhti, and the UK's Brooklyn Beckham, accompanied by fiancée, actress Nicola Peltz. Not to mention the all-powerful editor-in-chief of Vogue, Anna Wintour, also keen to see the physical runway debut of the designer from Illinois. Created specially for the occasion, the excellent soundtrack from Atlanta-born rapper Young Thug backed the eclectic 70-look show. A dozen black silhouettes opened proceedings, introducing elements that would be repeated throughout, including never-ending thigh-high boots with space-age soles, combined with embroidered shorts, fitted corsets or neoprene minidresses with peplums or structured frills. This cocktail of simplicity and contemporary practicality then gave way to a series of more classically inspired and impeccably elaborate tailored looks. 

Men's coats in gray, white and beige featured details such as Prince of Wales check, contrasting black lapels or lateral closures finished with the house's new padlock. These were followed by tailored pieces with contemporary twists, including large sleeveless coats with structured shoulders, dark-toned overshirts, and jackets and waistcoats with multiple bulky pockets, matched up with caps and shorts worn over fitted pants. It's worth remembering that Williams, much like Virgil Abloh and Heron Preston, belongs to the same artistic school as the multidisciplinary Kanye West. ""I wanted to take the tradition and history of Givenchy as a base while also really looking to the future,"" said the designer of his offering for the historic LVMH-owned brand for Spring/Summer 2022. This desire was reflected in the creative director's blending of radical, puritanical and at times extravagant elements, which created looks that were full of contrasting juxtapositions. A classic black bolero was paired with a large, rainbow-hued, bejeweled dress; conservative blazers with mohair jerseys; clean and sober overcoats with napa leather jackets featuring edgier, streetwear cuts; tulle dresses with clogs.

The dark color palette gradually opened to include more color, bringing in millennial tones of sky blue, light yellow, lilac and mint. This was in part due to a collaboration with New York-based artist Josh Smith, who complemented the house's own artisanal savoir-faire with disruptive prints and quirky accessories in the shape of plastic containers, clowns, Halloween pumpkins and distressed jeans. It's a creative partnership that evidently has great commercial potential, just like the collection's distinctive platform footwear, its metallic jewelry and its raffia and macramé bags.

"Oct 4, 2021","Turns out the Paris season’s biggest debut was on a crisp Monday when Yang Li presented his first collection for Chinese luxury marque Shang Xia, a brainy and beguiling high-color hybrid blend of east and west. 
This Spring/ Summer 2022 collection also marked the first since Exor, the investment vehicle of the Agnelli family, owners of Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, acquired control of Shang Xia from Hermès last December in an 80-million-euro deal.
 
In the end, what counted, and what always counts, was the clothes, and this collection was an unquestioned hit. Beijing-born, though Australia-raised, Yang Li took plenty of risks, playing with rich bright hues of shocking pink, sunset orange or Yves Klein blue.He tailored with precision – most splendidly a silver pony skin double-breasted redingote, collar worn up. And had the courage to cut with grand volume, sending out multiple down coats with flat fronts; flared puffers; or a great felt blazer in matt oatmeal with huge mutton chop brightest lime sleeves. Which probably shouldn’t have worked but did. 
“I wanted a bridge between east and west. And between the digital arena and physical arena; modern and traditional. I define Shang Xia as a portal between those two things. A platform that circulates contrasts,” said the gentlemanly Yang, a LVMH Prize finalist back in 2014.
 
Worn by a well-chosen cast perhaps marred by the fact that after four weeks of shows, many of them appeared to be limping over the finish line. Paris Fashion Week ends on Tuesday, bringing down the curtain on the international season.
 
Almost magically, Li also dreamed a great new series of footwear – white patent leather brothel creepers; transparent platform sandals; cut-out-toe booties. Also striking was the Absolute Triangle bag, made in a series of exacting cuts, a reference to how Chinese culture defines absolutely purity using shape.
 
“Combining craft and innovation is essential, which is also very Chinese. What I want to do is say that China is not just a market. It’s a creative force as well. And today is the first day of that story. It’s such a beautiful mission to embark on, which was the dream of my own brand. It’s why I am in fashion,” said Yang Li, who confirmed that he had put his own house “to sleep” while he directs Shang Xia.
 
The designer will continue to live mainly in London, commuting regularly to Shang Xia’s new headquarters on Rue du Vertbois in Paris' 3rd arrondissement. 
“Paris is the true center of fashion. And Shang Xia should be a Chinese luxury brand, so this is the right stage for the brand,” he underlined.  
 
There was a great sense of expectation pre-show. Editors lined up for a quotes from John Elkann, the Agnelli clan leader and CEO of Exor; who this summer also oversaw the launch of the Ferrari fashion.  
 
While Pierre Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermès, graciously turned up to bid adieu, at the circular runway of Espace Commines, a famed show space which has welcomed such greats as Helmut Lang and Paco Rabanne.
 
“I hope that you feel as surprised after this show as you did after seeing Ferrari,” chuckled the twinkle-eyed Elkann, referring to everyone’s shock that Ferrari’s fashion designer Rocco Iannone had delivered a high-tech active sportswear collection for Ferrari and not some revamped version of Gianni Agnelli’s classic Italian gent wardrobe.
 
One of the great mysteries in fashion is that two decades after research assistant Roopa Purushothaman coined the term BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China), there has never really emerged a champion designer from any of those four great nations. That Holy Grail for a BRIC fashion master may well have ended today, after Yang Li hit his fashion home run in Paris.
 
Expect a lot more action in the Shang Xia pipeline.

"Oct 4, 2021","Ann Demeulemeester returned to Paris to see the rebirth of her fashion house Sunday, though from the front and not the backstage, and sitting snugly beside the brand’s new owner, Italian fashion entrepreneur Claudio Antonioli. 
The collection, as it has been for the last few seasons, was designed by an in-house creative team. No one took a bow, which was probably just as well.
 
The show comes a couple of weeks after Ann and her husband cleverly revamped the house’s famed flagship in its hometown of Antwerp. So, given the deep pockets of Antonioli, who walked away from the sale of New Guards – the licensee of Off-White - with several hundred million euros, there was considerable anticipation about this show.The result was a perfectly acceptable collection for Spring/ Summer 2022 bearing the label Ann Demeulemeester. Just that the magic seemed to be missing. No muse seemed to have greatly inspired the collection, with the possible exception of lady called Madame Merchandiser.
 
She has been present in multiple collections in Milan and Paris as houses grapple with a terrible year of business and concentrate on making predictable fashion to entice former clients back into their stores, or more often online. 
In effect, the collection felt like a simulacrum of Demeulemeester, a designer known for her poetic style, rock 'n' roll attitude and ability to impart real emotion into her shows.
 
All that is not to say the collection didn't have plenty to wear.  Or many of Ann’s signatures – multiple drawstrings; unlikely grommet placements; belts trailing from waist and quirky phrases written onto T-shirts. Or this season, sketched onto couple of models’ cheekbones.
 
Ann always loved a statement hat, and practically every model wore one - whether planter’s stove pipes or colonial playboy bowlers, with slim brims trimmed with satin. 
The new team also updated the Ann silhouette, going for a wider, more forgiving version – with oversized jackets and billowing pants with large turn-ups – for both men and women in this co-ed show.  Matter of fact, the tailoring was embracing and flattering, from the double-breasted jackets with endless lapels to the Edwardian gent coats worn elongated knit sheaths to some great mat leather rocker coats.
 
All told, a perfectly respectable collection that however lacked the edgy majesty of classic Ann collections, making it more like a Demeulemeester bis, rather than a real rebirth.

"Oct 4, 2021","Victoria's Secret introduced on Friday its first-ever mastectomy bra, as part of a new initiative in partnership with leading designer and breast cancer awareness champion Stella McCartney. The Body by Victoria mastectomy bra is a wire-free design made with soft micro-fabric and lace and features a pocket within the inner lining to fit a prosthetic. Throughout the month of October, 100 percent of the Body by Victoria mastectomy bra sales will be donated to The Victoria's Secret Global Fund for Women's Cancers to support breast cancer research and discoveries. 

The campaign, which aims to create a greater understanding of the risks of breast cancer and importance of early detection, will roll out throughout October with a public service announcement (PSA) reminding women to #CheckYourself along with a guide, provided by The Stella Cares Foundation. The initiative will kick off with a full takeover of Victoria's Secret channels with risk and detection awareness education, while more than 25,000 Victoria's Secret associates around the world will also receive these materials, further spreading the potential impact to reach hundreds of thousands of women with this critical message. 

""As the world's leading lingerie brand, the health and well-being of women is paramount to our community,"" said Martha Pease, chief marketing officer, Victoria's Secret.

""We have a unique opportunity but also a responsibility to use our platform and scale of our global footprint to bring greater awareness to the risks of breast cancer, especially among younger women, and educate around the effectiveness of self-checks."" 

Victoria's Secret has had a longstanding commitment toward cancer research and education. It recently created The VS Global Fund for Women's Cancers with longstanding partner, Pelotonia, and aims to invest at least $5 million annually in cancer research.

Stella McCartney is equally one of the most powerful voices in breast cancer awareness and has been working for more than 20 years to raise money for research, share campaigns on prevention awareness and provide mastectomy products via The Stella Cares Foundation.

"Oct 3, 2021","The Roaring Twenties with a rock 'n' roll twist, Art Deco with a modern attitude in a first-rate collection from Lanvin this season, staged on a dank Sunday in Paris. 
The first runway show from the marque since the death of its much-loved former designer Alber Elbaz, whose influence was apparent in certain silhouettes.
 
As was that of founder Jeanne Lanvin and her fondness for Art Deco, the geometric forms of which rippled through a dramatic show, staged inside the Art Deco lobby of concert hall Salle Pleyel.Opening with a trio of curvy babydoll dresses in plissé silk and in high-gloss colors that played on Jeanne Lanvin's Zen for flou dressmaking. Later riffing on Alber’s sense of tulle-constructed or liquid-glaze glamour.
 
However, the biggest news was the prints and imagery – culled from Batman and various other DC superheroes. Part of a link-up with Warner Brothers, these were seen in dramatic, voluminous leather bomber and biker jackets.
 
Though Bruno's best ideas for Spring/Summer 2022 were the sexy sequined dresses, bra tops, cocktails, tanks and even sneakers finished with images of early American autos, Batmobiles and Batwoman in saturated colors.
 
The designer kept the metallic mood going in shaggy metallic tinsel coats and even a hooded Yeti coat, in a coed show. While a series of sequin-embellished chiffon dresses, drawn from a 1934 archive look named Concerto, were pretty sensational. Worn on a multi-generational cast including Carmen Kass, Élise Crombez and, for the final passage, Naomi Campbell, in a tinsel-lapel tuxedo suit with cape. 
 
""I am pretty sure we live in the equivalent of the Roaring Twenties today, but 100 years later. This was the first show since Alber's passing which left me very sad. So, I was looking deep into the archive at his ideas and those of Jeanne Lanvin,"" said Sialelli, as he grabbed a post-show cigarette outside.
 
Adding to the kicky 20s revival were new Flash X sneakers, inspired by superheroes and rock climbers and made in technical fabrics. While a collaboration with Judith Leiber led to glistening, playful minaudières, a nod to the house's logo which features a mother and child.
 
""To me Gotham City was all about the Art Deco movement. That's very evident in the 1992 Batman Returns movie by Tim Burton, so I wanted to reference that period this way – the idea that characters and superheroes support women,"" explained Sialelli. 
 
""Glamour that is light and relevant for today. It’s being part of a renewal and being fabulous as we come out of this whole pandemic,"" he added. 
The show was also the first since the arrival of Arnaud Bazin, who manages Lanvin on behalf of its Chinese owners Fosun International.
 
Since coming on board, Bazin has begun regrouping the house's studio, atelier, management and flagship, which had fissured into buildings in several arrondissements, back onto the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
 
""I was brought up professionally at Chanel and Dior. And like those great brands, Lanvin has to keep its team together. With the studio and atelier above the boutique. That builds esprit de corps and inspires the whole team,"" explained Bazin, who sat beside uber-influencer Olivia Palermo in the front row.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2021","All the world’s a red carpet, and nowhere more so than at Paris Fashion Week on Saturday night, where Balenciaga staged a runway show that took place, well, on a red carpet. 
A contrived, but not virtual one, seeing as this was also a premiere: that of a The Simpsons fashion short starring Homer and Marge. A tale of him making her birthday by taking her to Paris to buy a Balenciaga gown. The cartoon even featured Anna Wintour looking rather bored in the front row of a Balenciaga x Homer haute couture show.
 
Not only the models walked in this show, but also many of the audience, who all appeared on a giant screen inside the Théâtre du Châtelet, where the show/soirée/happening/hoax was staged.A bundle of fashion victims, editors, influencers, a couple of normal civilians and Madame Wintour all posed before a battery of some 40 photographers. Before what the French call a “savage casting,” of quirky beauties and dashing dudes, in among a few veterans, like Naomi and Amber, gradually took over the red wall.
 
In a sense the actual clothes were very much secondary to this work of performance art. Though what you could see, via odd camera angles and hopping editing looked pretty darned good. Testifying to the power of fashion and this brand, for an hour before and after the event several thousand fans stood in pouring rain cheering arrivals and departures. The latest show, after Balmain and Valentino, that has taken the action out on the streets, in the most recent democratization of Paris Fashion Week. 
Though this was not the first show to use this technique. Two decades ago, Imitation of Christ staged a show in an Upper East Side cinema, where each guest was required to make a $10 contribution to a Central American garment workers union to gain entry. Some paid, some baulked, others angrily refused. All recorded and then shown – on a two-minute time lapse – inside the cinema, much to the delight of the audience.
 
Back in Paris, the Spring/Summer 2022 collection itself contained multiple examples of the evocative and voluminous fashion of Demna Gvasalia, the creative director of Balenciaga. 
 
Freakish, but never farcical proportions were used in grand gangster suits in serge, with chalk and grandad stripes. In effect, Demna has reconquered fashion for the color black. Pre-Instagram you could always spot where a fashion show was about to take place by the number of people dressed in black outside a doorway.
 
Now, Balenciaga has made black hip and vital again. With the exception of a great show by Yohji Yamamoto, Demna's was more or less the only majorly black-paletted show in Paris.
 
Gvasalia’s other great talent is in terms of proportion, which in part stems from his youth as a refugee in Mitteleuropa, where underground youth style in cities like Berlin and Vienna are based on skinny youngsters buying discarded tailored clothing and wearing them oversized. 
Fans and guests inside cheered throughout the show, and during the film, before Gvasalia took a brief bow to prolonged applause from the first floor, sitting beside Balenciaga’s owner, Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault, and Balenciaga CEO Cédric Charbit.
 
""What can I tell you? I work for a genius, and I have a great team. Demna comes up these ideas like working with The Simpsons and we just do out best to make it happened,"" said the skinny Charbit, in a black double-breasted tuxedo, the silhouette of which reached four inches past either shoulder.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2021","Andreas Kronthaler's vision of Spring/Summer 2022 for Vivienne Westwood is sexy and theatrical in equal measure. He presented his work in a sensationalist show that was faithful to the punk roots of the British designer and activist, who was also present for proceedings, which took place on a rainy morning in Le Marais, on Saturday, October 2. The venue chosen for the disruptive show was the Garage Amelot, a 7,000-square-meter industrial space with a glass roof, which lent a minimalist ambience to the event. Now in her 80s, Vivienne Westwood is still fighting fit. And her energy was channeled into each one of the almost 70 looks presented during the latest runway show from her brand at this season's Paris Fashion Week. Under the creative direction of the activist designer's Austrian husband, Andreas Kronthaler, the British label unveiled a collection that exuded the freshness of new beginnings. ""I thought about starting again, but to do that, you have to free up some space. And that's what I tried to do with this collection. I hope that it helps me reach new horizons,"" commented the 55-year-old designer. 

The result was an explosive and sensual wardrobe with plenty of references to Marilyn, as seen in the fitted silhouettes of pencil skirts and in exuberant décolletage. This suggestive style also took the form of structured jackets with exaggerated shoulders, combined with shorts of varying lengths and even a miniscule white bodysuit. In addition, there were a number of asymmetrical dresses, some made out of shawls, others featuring punky overlapping tulle, photographic prints or lace in intense shades of scarlet. The coed show was characterized by the sustainable approach that the British brand has become known for. Fabric reclaimed from dead stocks gave form to innovative silhouettes, while organic cotton was used in the show's shirts, which included a ripped, oversize version with a skeleton print, as well as in a short Tyrolean-inspired cardigan in intense fuchsia. 100% biodegradable and recyclable linen appeared in a graphic sweater in salmon and blue, combined with a calf-length skirt and boxing boots. For its 90s-style jacket with crossed lacing, a golden skirt and its foulard dresses, the brand opted for certified sustainable viscose. 

Among the most interesting ensembles, one could highlight the show's theatrical close, which featured two versions of the classic bridal look, in black and white. Paired with matching veils, these dramatic designs rose up in enormous trapeziums of fabric, an effect completed with an irreverent wink, as the backs of the dresses left little to the imagination. 

As the show drew to its end, Kronthaler took Westwood by the hand before the attentive gaze of the audience, which included model Georgia May Jagger, singer Paris Jackson and famous drag queens Miss Fame and Simone, and invited her to be part of a family photo featuring the runway's full cast in the center of the industrial space. The audience erupted into applause. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 2, 2021","Dissolving into water, being carried away by the current, breathing in the bracing ocean air – gliding and flowing in undulating outfits. Water has been a recurring theme in the collections presented in Paris this season, perhaps most notably on Friday, the fifth day of shows. From Issey Miyake, which took its audience on a dive into the depths of a swimming pool, to Nina Ricci with its modern mermaids, and Christian Wijnants, who took his inspiration from the Mediterranean coast. Issey Miyake presented its new collection in a showroom, but also contributed a beautiful film, shot in an architecturally captivating virtual swimming pool, to this season's digital calendar. Wearing a swimming cap, a leotard and a flowing skirt, the first model plunged off a diving board, while the other models climbed down a ladder, submerging themselves in the virtual water, before descending deeper and deeper. 

All was peace and quiet, evoking flowing water and the mystery of the ocean depths. Designer Satoshi Kondo, who leads the house's womenswear collections, expressed all of these sensations through the fluidity, lightness and shine of his materials. Ensembles with wide trousers and long, wavy dresses seemed to float around the models' bodies, at times as though the intangible fabric had been simply placed there and fitted with the help of a little draping. Certain outfits were decorated with hand-applied splashes or stripes of paint, which appeared to be diluted by the water. The Japanese brand's great technical skill could be seen in a series of modular skirts and dresses with shifting contours, made up of rippled circles of fabric that had been sewn together. These pieces could be concertinaed compactly when not being worn and unfurled effortlessly when it was time to put them on. The different-toned disks of fabric each had a porthole-like opening at their center and came together to create a kind of multicolored, ever-moving architecture. The mysteries of the deep also inspired Lisi Herrebrugh and Rushemy Botter this season, both for the collection they cooked up for their own label, Botter, and for the one they put together for Nina Ricci, which was presented with a film punctuated by futuristic digital images, where the ""mermaids of tomorrow"" who gave their name to the collection were plunged into deep water or swallowed up by gigantic waves thanks to digital effects. 

The creativity of the Dutch design duo continues to anchor the Parisian label in contemporary fashion with an innovative and fresh approach. Once again, their latest summer collection bubbled over with original and desirable pieces, such as palm-shaped rubber handbags, dive-bootie-like shoes, tight Lycra balaclava-tops that looked like wetsuits, and suits tailored in terrycloth.

In the same nautical vein, the designers wrapped their mermaids up in black tunic-nets, which were worn over other clothes, draped over the models' shoulders, or wound around their torsos or legs, where they were transformed into trousers. Also worthy of mention were the smart cuts of the couple's suits, where jackets and skirts opened out like large portholes, revealing strapless bras, tops and tight skirts in pop shades of turquoise, orange and lime green.  
Christian Wijnants unveiled his collection for Spring/Summer 2022 on the seashore, backed up by the sound of cicadas and the come-and-go of the waves. With their coral-shaped earrings, strappy summer dresses, light cotton caftans and painted shirt-dresses, the models were presented immersed in the wilderness. 

They scanned the horizon, bent over a cactus in order to observe it more closely, looked up to the sienna-colored sun as they played with a pebble, or broke into dance. One satin dress opened at the back, allowing the sun to caress the model's skin, while tunics in overlapping floral camouflage prints fluttered in the wind. 

A stretch of linen crossed around the model's neck served as an improvised dress – perfect for clambering up trees. Head-to-toe looks featured the refreshing color palette so characteristic of the Belgian designer, with outfits in egg yolk, icy mint and orange.

"Oct 2, 2021","One of the great ironies of recent fashion history is that the house of Karl Lagerfeld has achieved its greatest appeal and commercial success since the passing of the great designer. 
That’s a tribute to an astute management team, and also to smart merchandising, which has played  on Lagerfeld’s iconic status with a a good deal of humor. His unique reputation's continued strength has been proven by the huge success of the collectible NFT series launched by the brand that bears his name. 
 
This past week the house dropped the latest NFT digitally rendered avatar of Karl. Playing into the fact that seven was the designer’s lucky number, this animated Karl was made available in a limited run of 300 pieces at a price of 77 euros each. One of the brand’s previous NFT drops sold out in 37 seconds.This season, when it came to clothes and accessories, logos were pretty much everywhere at Lagerfeld, probably too much so. Especially at a house which has plenty of visual signifiers, from Karl’s German Expressionism-inspired women's silhouettes to his starched, high-collar gentleman’s shirts and his leather mittens.
 
Instead, every inch of every item of athletic-looking underwear – from bra strap to trim – had his name. Backpacks, man-bags, computer cases, holdalls in black nylon or camouflage, all came with the name and address – Karl Lagerfeld, 21 rue Saint Guillaume Paris.
 Admittedly the house has worked hard on freshening up its monogram canvas – seen in sea blue totes. Though the most catching elements turned out to be the first clothes from a collaborative capsule with 90s uber-model Amber Valletta. This followed on from a series of corrugated, vegan, cactus leather bags that she developed for the house this spring.
 
A few key looks, like the leather bomber worn with pristine cotton shirt-dress, looked very now and very Karl Lagerfeld. And, happily for once, there wasn't a logo in sight.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 2, 2021","A major injection of hipness into Hermès this season, and all the better for it. Almost as if the Hermès lady had moved to a loft in Brooklyn or an art gallery in Hackney, or was working on a novel in Ostiense, in Rome. Downtown with a dash of devilment. 
 Using innovative cutting and a sleek series of new leather styles, the house’s designer, Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski, knocked a good decade off the brand’s target market for Spring/Summer 2022. And somehow made the brand that much more relevant.
 
Hermès is all about discreet luxury, but this was a new discretion with a soupçon of verve and a rich helping of panache.From scalloped-neckline negligee dresses with studded hems to skillfully rouched glove leather cocktails whispering refinement, but with a dash of rock. While studded fine wool double-breasted coat-dresses injected a little posh punk.
 
The designer’s big idea this season was playing with leather trim on some great gathered jute dresses and white canvas parkas, keeping the house's equestrian DNA.
 
Plus, the new Hermès platform sandal – made of foam and finished with logoed monkish straps – could be worn anywhere, stylish yet practical. Made in caramel or black and paired with matching socks they imparted a tougher attitude to Hermès, which can at times be a tad too ladylike and uptight.
 
Not this season, where Nadège even sent out wool bustiers and a leather bra with stenciled equestrian scenes, worn with matching dhotis. Finishing the show with several marvelous perforated leather dresses and highwayman coats in the prettiest of butter yellows.
 All shot inside a hangar within a private jet terminal in Le Bourget, the historic airport of Paris. One side of the hangar opened at the finale, to reveal the two-score of cast standing before the airfield. To attend, Hermès insisted everyone take their limousines to the show, and then instructed drivers to play their Bourget playlist in the cars.
 
A triumph for Vanhee-Cybulski and a significant step forward for Hermès. A day not even spoiled by the fashion pandemonium outside the show, as VIPs and influencers begged tearfully for limousines in the rain. With the award for the biggest panic attack going to one twitching Italian editor. About time he took the E train to Park Slope.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 2, 2021","Fashion models rarely look more proud than in Yohji Yamamoto shows, especially when the Japanese designer produces one of his vintage performances, which is what his latest collection was.
 Staged in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris, hundreds of fans braved the Friday night rain in a vain search for entry into this show. Those fortunate enough to have an invite were rewarded by a particularly beguiling and beautiful show.
 
Yamamoto’s sheer purist technique as a draper places him among the very greatest of designers. Using mixes of rayon and cotton in a whole range of weights, he swaddled his cast intricately, but with a lightness of touch rarely seen from Yamamoto.Famed as a designer capable of creating artistic fashion that somehow looks protective, this season he lightened up his approach. Most every neckline was low, shoulders were exposed, and lengths were shortened.
 
""I even showed a mini. My first time ever. It’s my response to global warming. It’s getting so hot on our planet you have to wear less clothes,"" said Yamamoto in a post-show chat with FashionNetwork.com.
 
Created entirely in black, with just a few daubs of silver on a trio of elaborately layered sheathes. A trio of deconstructed crinolines, where you could see the aluminum and tartan-patterned construction, brought a ripple of admiration from an audience also largely in black.
 
Asked why he created almost solely in black, Yamamoto responded with a broad smile: ""That’s the reason I am a designer. Besides, I don’t need the help of color!""
 
The melodic soundtrack of bluesy rock added a sense of longing and loss, including the 77-year-old Yamamoto himself playing lead guitar and singing Bob Dylan’s ""Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.""
 His entire cast – none of them huge names, but all looking beautiful – were done up with silver eyeliner and the most brilliant pearl gray hairpieces and pirate braids, in the most fantastical hair and makeup of any runway show this season. All of them walked with enormous sense of self, one so self-assured that she walked almost into the photographers’ pit, practically daring them to back away.
 
The proudest possible cast, as well they should be.  Not every gal gets to star in a vintage Yohji show.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 2, 2021","In recent years, Valentino has staged its collections in a Rothschild mansion or behind Napoleon’s Tomb, presenting to a restricted and pampered audience. This season the Roman house took its collection right out onto the streets of funky eastern Paris.In a path-breaking move, Pierpaolo Piccioli sent his cast first past the great and the good of fashion inside the Carreau de Temple and then outside the 19th-century wrought iron market to parade past a new generation of fashion and art students. Perched on bistro tables, they cheered on an impressive display by the Valentino brand. 
 
Which itself included a whole new collection called Valentino Archive, once again an iconoclastic concept, since it was based on sourcing iconic looks out of founder Valentino Garavani’s early designs and regenerating them for the 21st century.Longtime fans of the house will recognize many of them – the white dress worn by Marisa Berenson, animal print coats, glam floral dresses memorably photographed by Chris von Wangenheim. Often the new line consisted of couture ideas revived in acrylic hues, in techy fabrics like washed taffeta, polyfaille or nylon. Or stenciled-out nylon floral shirts, which Piccioli called The New Lace
 
All anchored by new military bovver boots or kicky centurion rock-stud sandals. While for guys, there were great double-breasted aubergine suits and techy faille shirts, worn with pearl necklaces and a man bag in green. Plus, some great new denim looks, including wide-legged silhouettes culled from the debut of Valentino Jeans back in 1985.
 
All taking Valentino out of a Roman palazzo and into the midst of the greater public. Very literally, as besides the creative colleges kids, several thousand young fashion fans outside defied the steady rain to cheer on each look as it rounded the market.
 
""It’s a celebration of the power of the image of Valentino. No boundaries but freedom of expression in salon and in the street. Rebooting the brand to give new meaning to recognized codes,"" explained Piccioli in a morning preview inside the Paris headquarters of Valentino, a corner view over the world’s jewelry mecca, Place Vendôme. And a far cry from the funky fourth arrondissement where this ""Valentino Rendez-Vous"" show was held.The show also marked the first in Paris since the appointment of new CEO Jacopo Venturini, known as a merchandising wiz. And it comes after multiple reports from department store buyers that Valentino business has been slipping for several seasons.
 
Another reason that throwing open the doors to the outside world seems like such a smart idea.

A new CEO, and a new broom. A new show concept and a new fashion line. A new energy and Valentino looks like it's finally heading very much in the right direction.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 1, 2021","The rain from the Bay of Biscay may have engulfed the City of Light, but the mood was sunny and optimistic at Isabel Marant and Leonard, quietly confident at Moynat and effervescent at Baccarat.. 
Isabel Marant: Full throttle beachwear
 
Not many designers have a bigger heart than Isabel Marant, whose casts treat her like the big sister they wished they always had.Not for Isabel the agonizing trauma of many designers as they attempt to squeeze a collection out of their imaginations. With Marant creation seems to come far more easily, just like her clothes, which are insouciant, upbeat, understandable and generally very cool.
 
Though she unveiled her latest ideas in the urban splendor of the Palais Royal, and threw a hectic drinks party post-show, this Spring/Summer 2022 collection had only one destination: the beach. Preferably at sunset, so as to look great in parachute-shaped blouses and pants, floating off the figure in Japanese and graffiti prints.
 
Marant fully understands the female figure, so her deep-pocket boxing shorts and parachute pants flattered and never engulfed the models. Paired with frilly bra tops, bustiers or hippie-chic Ladakh mini gilets, they made for a great opening section.
 
Her overall inspiration were the sporty 90s style photos of veteran Swiss photographer Hans Feurer, which managed to marry athleticism and sexiness. Just like this collection did. Moynat on the move

One venerable brand that had stayed a tad too venerable is Moynat, though the arrival of new creative director Nicholas Knightly in the past year suggests that the house may be about to gather real momentum.
 
In his first steps, Knightly is keeping it personal, particularly in his debut bag, an elegant shell-shaped bag called the Flori. Nicholas named it after his horse, a dressage stallion he keeps in his country house in Gloucester.
 
Made frequently in the house’s Art Deco, multi-""M"" toile, and finished with precision steel buckles, they had a precise, attractive style. Better yet, the brand provides an in-house artist free of charge, who can paint on clients’ initials and stripes of their choice. The Paris store’s artists can even paint remarkably concise retro styles with great grace. Classy customization at its most intelligent.
 
""It’s a tradition that dates back to when liners docked at a port, and there were literally hundreds of huge trunks. So, the only way your staff could recognize your trunk was thanks to a bright stripe and decoration,"" explains Knightly, an English gent who spent almost 15 years at Vuitton, before being hired last year to revamp Moynat.
 
""I love working at heritage brands like Moynat"" said the designer of the label, which was founded in 1849 on nearby Avenue de l’Opéra. When one editor admired and photographed a smart new black graphic logo tote, the designer politely explained that its his own personal one.
 
""There’s lot to do, and quite a lot in the pipeline. Though creating great bags and accessories involves a long lead time,"" explained Knightly, who, when asked why there was no Moynat wheelie, explained that, as top-notch brands like to design every individual piece, that should appear in about 12 months.
 
However, the brand still desperately needs to change its flagship store, whose dull burgundy glass exteriors remind one of a dental clinic with surly dentists on the inside. Plenty to do, even if Moynat now seems to have been pointed in the right direction.Leonard: Nefertiti in the Loire

The French have always had a thing for Egypt, ever since Napoleon’s expedition there in 1798, and Jean-François Champollion subsequently becoming the first person in the modern world to decipher that land’s ancient hieroglyphics.
 
That admiration continues today chez Leonard, where designer Georg Lux references the land of the pharaohs in a party time collection. And video, in a shoot capturing beauties frolicking around a pool and chateau down the Loire Valley.
 
Lux took great Coptic Egyptian prints with jagged friezes and desert flowers and whipped them into V-neck poolside dresses, tops and pants.
 
He also dipped into the archive for a fantastically bold dahlia print for several uber-bright Lycra cocktails. The house also developed a new interlocked ""L"" monogram print, seen in polo shirts for boys and soft jersey blazers for gals. There’s even a barely-there chain metal logo top. 
 
""If you wear it when sunning yourself, it will leave you with a logo graphic on your torso,"" chuckled Lux. 
Baccarat: Brilliant with the baby designers

One can never fault Baccarat for not taking risks. Like this week in Paris, when it unveiled a series of surrealist and pop-cultural crystal glasses by an eclectic gang of creators in tribute to its famed Harcourt glass.
 
On Thursday, it revealed the link-up featuring 11 bright young things and their visions of the Harcourt – a six-dimple goblet that is celebrating its 180th anniversary this year. We're talking about creatives like the coolest after-party DJ, Honey Fucking Dijon; Benjamin Benmoyal, the star of La Caserne Paris’ new creative center; or Festival de Hyères winner Tom Van der Borght.
 
Catching the light on display in Baccarat’s beautiful mansion in Place des États-Unis were pieces by Victor Weinsanto, whose Harcourt Queer goblet looked like a beating heart, or Charles de Vilmorin’s Harcourt Family, which had beautifully illustrated fish practically swimming off cut glass. While Lebanese-born, Paris-raised Mira Mikati chimed in with Harcourt Pop, a series of neo-Memphis looks covered in crochet.  
 
Other innovators to have participated include Imane Ayissi, Clara Daguin, Jarel Zhang, Kévin Germanier and Yoshikimono. A witty and faintly wild project put together by Laurence Benaïm, France’s most famous fashion historian. 
 
The display comes two weeks after Baccarat announced solid bounce-back figures, as first half 2021 revenues exceeded pre-pandemic levels, rising 19.9 % to 86.6 million euros. Good to see the grand dame of glassware in such fine and fighting fettle.

"Oct 1, 2021","The problem with deconstruction, a huge movement in fashion, is that while it looks great on runways, it tends to frighten consumers on a clothes rack. Not at Rokh, especially this season, which staged a great collection Thursday evening in the Petit Palais.
 Ultimately a comment on how much talent has Rokh’s designer, Korean-born Rok Hwang, who displaced, distanced and above all disassembled garments with grace and a touch of genius this season. The key thing was that his idea of deconstruction looked delicate and not dangerous, as often happens using this technique.
 
Cropped tuxedos that fall off the shoulders just so, worn with upside down jackets made into flared skirts. The torsos of trenches reinvented as minis or askew cummerbunds. A classy blouse that descends into a corset to finish in a trench coat. A brilliantly cut trench/dress dissected by multiple military belts. A crème caramel jumpsuit combining bustier and fatigue pants.All pretty complicated but never confused or confusing. The sort of stylish, assured and visually striking show and collection that one only ever really sees in Paris. Albeit, by a London-based house.
 
For this graduate of Central Saint Martins, alumni of Phoebe Philo’s Celine and 2018 LVMH special prize winner, this felt like a break-out collection.
 
Even if it was not a show without its flaws – there was an awkward evening wear malfunction with a clinging gold column that keep revealing too much on one model, and a final feathered bubble skirt look that really didn’t work. Plus, why put on your soundtrack The Damned’s gruff and grotty version of 'White Rabbit', when you can play Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane?
 
But these are small quibbles after a memorable display by a designer very much on his A game. Rokh has arrived.

"Sep 30, 2021","“We are obsessed with technology and all its benefits,” said Sébastien Meyer, one half of the duo behind red hot indie brand Coperni. So much so that Meyer and partner Arnaud Vaillant even cast Steve Jobs’ daughter Eve in their show.The beautiful blonde Apple heiress appearing in a techy stretch green top, crystalline embroidered mini and the brand’s new signature platform sandals with shell-encrusted straps; her face finished with retro-futurist white shades.
 
Young Eve was one of some 30 models who marched on a catwalk of sand laid down inside a field of huge hemp plants, within a giant show-space on the perimeter of Paris on a sunny Thursday morning. A setting that transported the audience back to the beach, and had that sweet odor of hemp.This season Coperni’s initial idea for their spring-summer 2022 came from Vaillant, who “dreamed of girls going to a beach in the future, in 2033.” 
Hence, they showed cutaway jackets and tuxedos; with lots of shoulders and collar bones exposed; and cut trousers with volume, including multi-pocket fatigue pants. Half the cast wore just bras up top – lace, crochet, athletic and dark psychedelic-style paisleys.
 
For cocktail hour, tops and dresses in patchwork prints with images of emojis, children’s robots and cartoon characters. Throughout the gals strode over the sand attired in psychedelic paisley style tights; and walked in multiple hippie art deco platforms. 
The duo also astutely worked their branding – trimming many athletic looks with Coperni, and adding their curvy 'C' logo, seen on Miss Jobs’ top.
 
“Techno chic woman going to the beach. She loves fashion. She’s a surfer. She’s a mermaid,” added Meyer.
 
“We are fascinated by technology, and by Apple. So having Eve Jobs in her first ever show is amazing,” he concluded.

"Sep 30, 2021","Talk about using brand power. Dior went into full court press in the first 48 hours of Paris Fashion Week – unveiling its new Cheval Blanc spa, feting its Dior Home and Kids creator Cordelia de Castellane, and unveiling a Miss Dior pop-up floral rose fantasy front on Avenue, the restaurant of the fashion industry on Avenue Montaigne.
 
Even before all those events, the house had also invited a gang of art critics and editors Tuesday morning to discover the impressive Jean-Michel Othoniel retrospective inside the Petit Palais, underwritten by Christian Dior Parfums.
 
Oh, in between all that, the house staged the latest vital runway show by its women’s wear designer and couturier Maria Grazia Chiuri, reviewed separately by FashionNetwork.com.
 
Five different events in two days, doubly impressive when you consider that Dior’s historic flagship boutique, studio and ateliers on Avenue Montaigne are in the midst of a major overhaul; and its new headquarters on the Champs-Élysées is being completed.
 Dior Spa Cheval BlancNo question about the wow-factor at the plush and pristine Dior Spa Cheval Blanc, located in the basement of LVMH’s new five-star hotel located on the banks of the Seine.
 Like the rest of the hotel, which affords remarkable views of the Seine, Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower, the spa was designed by Peter Marino, the preferred architect of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and his wife Helene.
 
“I wanted maximum luxury, but fresh and unexpected,” explained Marino, dressed in his traditional after-hours naughty black leather biker look.One brilliant solution: the splendid underground pool which ingeniously has elongated video screens along one wall reproducing the exact same view of the Seine, boats and bridges seen from the ground-floor. Subtly using the low ceiling to advantage to make the space seem twice as grand.
 
Unlike, so many big city spas, Dior Spa Cheval Blanc never feels claustrophobic – the light gold and ecru very easy on the eye. Plus, there are plenty of innovations – from the brown graphite bed to drain toxins; to the double treatment room for loving couples.
 
Every bed and massage table finished with Dior toile de jouy blue throws and the crispest linen sheets, embroidered with Monsieur Dior’s bon mots – Au fond de chaque coeur sommeille un rêve, meaning - 'At the bottom of your heart a dream is always dozing'. 
 
All told, Dior’s new spa is probably the swishiest and smartest urban enclave of its sort in any major city.
 Ma Maison de CampagneCordelia de Castellane is more like an 'It Mum' than an 'It Gal'. She’s a mum of four, and the designer of Dior’s kids, babies and objects departments. And she is only 40. Talk about overachieving.  
 
This summer she designed and decorated the restaurant of the moment, Café Lapérouse on Place de la Concorde. On Monday, she had the great and the good at her book signing in Lapérouse of 'Ma Maison de Campagne'.Joining her for a meal of smoke salmon and fish with lemongrass sauce were the great and good of Paris. From Galeries Lafayette Nicolas Houzé to Nicolas Bazire, the 'Nurse Ratched' of LVMH; a score of top fashion and magazine editors; Antoine Arnault, an investor in Lapérouse, and Natalia Vodianova, who wrote the book’s forward.
 
“With a genealogical tree that includes the most illustrious aristocratic families in Europe, and an education among the Paris fashion elite, it’s not so surprising that Cordelia incarnates good taste,” writes Vodianova.
 
Ma Maison de Campagne, tag-lined as The Art of Living with the Colors of the Season, is a sumptuous record of de Castellane’s maximalist style in her cut-stone country house. Illustrated with photos of her throughout the year, with beautifully laid tables capturing her haute-eclectic taste that includes, bien sur, multiple examples of refined Dior glassware, ceramics and fabrics.
 
As one guest remarked, it’s the sort of book that one’s wife looks at and responds by saying 'I hope we get an invitation for a weekend'.
 Jean-Michel Othoniel’s Narcissus Theorem  
The exhibition 'Narcissus Theorem' by Jean-Michel Othoniel in the Petit Palais that opened this week is the latest expression of Christian Dior Parfums truly laudable project – Jardins Culturels, which has seen it renovate and restore important gardens in France.“The show means an enormous amount to me. It was vital during the lockdown as it allowed me to imagine the future. And I’d really like to thank Christian Dior Parfums for being such a generous patron of the arts and this show,” Othoniel told FashionNetwork.com.
 
All told, 70 works, all but one created site-specific for the exhibition. From his brilliant blue gleaming river of bricks that runs up the stairs of the Petit Palais and golden pearl necklaces hanging in the museum’s garden to the gray steel grotto in the ground floor, ideal for meditation, to the marvelous Murano glass chandelier hanging in an Art Nouveau stairway, the first new installation in the building in almost a century. 
 
“I wanted a joyful, optimistic and enchanting vision,” added Othoniel. He is possibly best known for his millennium glass bubble entrance way to Palais Royal’s metro station opposite the Louvre, beloved by thousands of tourists.
 
Next week, he receives the ultimate accolade in France, he will enter the Institut de France, as an academician. Or as they say popularly, he will become an Immortal.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 30, 2021","Paris is all about contrasts, as Patou went for a voluminous Puss-in-Boots-meets-d’Artagnan, while Acne Studios riffed on innerwear as outerwear in the latest body con statement this season
 Patou: Richelieu 'n' RollAlready after just three years, with Guillaume Henri designing, Patou has grown rapidly and now includes 130 retail store and online shop clients.“We are all now just going back to real life and I asked myself, what would we wear? And I decided to dress people for a party that doesn’t exist, a little crazy. So, I had in mind a little hero – Puss in Boots. And using multiple artists who use fantasy as an escape.,” explained Henri.
 
He went on to incorporate sketches by Christian Berard who art directed Beauty and the Beast; Jean Jacques Lequeu who sketched a fantasy world known as The Island of Love; or Gustave Doré who sketched Puss in Boots.
 
Many 18th-century silhouettes and Cardinal Richelieu shapes but in Clongowes Wood purple, recycled faille. Indeed, some 90% of the collection’s fabrics are upcycled or recycled. 
Multiple musketeers’ references with collars that dive 10 inches down the chest; cavalier cuffs and shirts that ballooned out from the body. Mixed in with pleated sports skirts, respecting Jean Patou’s origins as the first true designer to design chic active sportswear. Or boy’s bloomers worn with recycled knit cardigans, or even a sweatshirt trimmed with gros-grain ribbon.
 
“Have to admit, this the first time in my entire life that l have showed a sweatshirt during fashion week,” laughed Henri. In another first he shot his own video – where he defines five clients: executive lady, cool girl, influencer, woman in a hurry and couture model.
 
Everything finished with “royal jewelry” like beaded faux gold chains and necklaces and chunky belt buckles used in faille belts.
 
In a word, his most realized collection for Patou, a LVMH house that has quietly gathered real momentum.
 
 Acne Studios: Getting in touch with your outermost innerwear 
Innerwear as wild and enticing outerwear was the key message at the latest collection from Acne Studios.
 
After the most exposed flesh season in Milan in decades, they are also flaunting it in Paris, especially at Acne Studios, where most of the cast looked like they emerged from a boudoir. 
Corsetry inverted; cut on the bias, dissected with harnesses and extended into body stockings. Lace body stockings and micro crochet bras and tops. All of it chopped up, slightly torn, stitched together with straps. 
 
Naughty fashion but never sado-masochistic. Women in control but not a dominatrix in sight. All marching on a crushed velvet catwalk, towering but not teetering over the audience, as they marched in giant plywood platforms. 
It’s a telling comment on this season, that even if barely escaping the pandemic and still very much in the midst of the Me Too movement, designers are sending out so much revealing fashion. Bodycon styles are everywhere, and the message is very much that women can be as proud and suggestive as they wish, and that does not cheapen them one iota.
 
Hence, this was the latest triumph by Acne Studios' designer Jonny Johansson, who has managed to turn a cool and credible Swedish brand into a must-see show in the world’s leading capital of fashion, Paris.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 30, 2021","A festival-like atmosphere overtook the Bois de Vincennes on Wednesday, September 29. As well as its usual morning joggers, cyclists and dogwalkers, the green lung of western Paris welcomed a select group of guests attending the latest Courrèges show from Nicolas Di Felice. Parading along the park's damp walkways, they made a pilgrimage to the heart of the forest, a journey which inevitably recalled the come-and-go of concert attendees usually seen in the immense green space, known for its summer music festivals and free parties.The idea was to take the show's guests on a journey into the festival memories of the designer, who led attendees, all of whom carried invitations in the form of metal bracelets – a clear nod to music festival wristbands – to a grassy esplanade where he had painted a large square in white paint on the ground, prefiguring the refined and minimalistic tone of the show. The designer's chosen decor was both monumental and festive, in a similar vein to his first show as the brand's creative director, which was also hosted on the outskirts of the French capital, at ""La Station,"" in Aubervilliers, this March. 

As though planned by the brand itself, the clouds that had been threatening rain dissipated, revealing a sun-brightened blue sky just as the first notes of the compositions by musician and friend of Di Felice, Erwan Sene, began to play, signaling the start of the show presenting the designer's latest collection, ""Both of Us Knowing."" Just in case, the brand had provided its guests with white logo rain ponchos, which will now probably have to wait until the next festival season to be worn by their recipients. Among the attendees, one could pick out actress Agathe Rousselle, who plays the protagonist in the award winning film, Titane; fashion designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin, and businessman François Pinault, accompanied by his son, François-Henri Pinault, the current CEO of the Kering group. Courrèges has belonged to Artémis, the holding company run by the family of French millionaires, since 2017. Di Felice bet on a strong opening for the show, sending out contemporary reinterpretations of Courrèges' heritage and vocabulary, manifested in three effective capes with simple, geometric patterns, inspired by a circular design from 1968, a triangular piece from 1969 and a square silhouette from 1995. Taking full advantage of the skill and craftsmanship of the atelier offered by the brand founded by André and Coqueline Courrèges in 1961, the designer created exaggerated proportions that covered the whole body. 

There was also a logic of contrasts that was reflected in looks combining parkas and bombers with the brand's classic overcoats or its instantly recognizable A-line miniskirts, some of which were offered in fun, pop versions featuring diagonal stripes and double pockets, while others were strictly black and offered side cut-outs at the hips. This sensual showing of skin continued in low-waisted jeans and in dresses and tops featuring triangular cut-outs over the chest. In addition, a ""Loop"" theme based on the blending of different fabrics was brought into miniscule tops, dresses, skirts and even this season's bag, which is inspired by the straps of a Courrèges dress from 1976, a piece acquired by Di Felice himself years ago.  In combination with ribbed garments and pieces in the house's characteristic vinyl, models with thick black eyeliner sported caps that matched their all-over single-color looks, or XXL earrings, as well as over-the-knee disco boots. The close of the show came with the arrival of three light, asymmetrical looks made out of a simple strip of cloth. As for the techno-inspired color palette, it ranged from intense silver and pale yellow to sky blue and pink, the favorite color of André Courrèges. Indeed, the tributes were everywhere on a day when the brand's history was also channeled into the launch of its new perfumes. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 29, 2021","Paris’ big debut this season was Charles de Vilmorin at Rochas, the current enfant terrible of French fashion, who made his Wednesday lunchtime debut with a strikingly new fashion statement, where each ensemble seemed radically juxtaposed.

Everyone who mattered in fashion showed up, from Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and Anna Wintour. All crowded into three gilded rooms inside the Hotel Mona Bismarck, located on a heavily trafficked stretch of the Seine, opposite the Eiffel Tower. Outside, the hundreds of street photographers and fans almost spilled into the traffic.It helps that Charles comes from French creative royalty – his grand aunt was Louise de Vilmorin, a famed lady of letters and companion of André Malraux, the world’s first minister of culture.
 
And there is something about historic France in de Vilmorin’s mode - gothic castles, dark surrealism, Jean Cocteau movies and high-end ‘60s psychedelic. Miles Davis meets Saint Laurent – Charles is his doppleganger - on acid. 
 
De Vilmorin is an innately gifted artist and illustrator, evident again from his invitation – a curvaceous series of detailed pen strokes showing a piano, stool and wild flowers. Even more so in the brilliant way he made the location his own – over-painting all the ground floor windows of the mansion with his sketches of funky voluptuous Amazons.
 
There was plenty to admire in this debut runway collection. His previous collections for his eponymous label were all shows in presentations and videos. 

At Rochas, he opened with a cutaway shoulder leather military shirt worn over tinsel plissé skirt and golden pirate boots; and then a medieval, laced-up leather dress worn over a white smock shirt and anchored by bio-morphist red and yellow boots. 
 
The roots of his ideas are certainly grand, but the result are very groovy. Though quintessentially French, if he reminds one of anyone it is probably Vivienne Westwood.
 
De Vilmorin’s big trick was attaching stiff tulle along multiple sleeves, shoulders and trims, almost like fish fins. It added an otherworldly element to metallic rouched cocktails; form-fitting tops or maids in plissé dresses.
 
Though the most beautiful looks were his white poplin tents dresses and mannish shirts – in a partly co-ed show – finished with his phantasmagoric sketches.
 
Working with stylist Camille Bideau Waddington added in touch of funky glamour. Which was needed, as if the collection had any obvious fault it was that it looked too much his previous ideas for his own house.
 
But de Vilmorin is young, still in his mid 20s, and has plenty of ideas in his mind. Expect his career to soar – he is that good.

"Sep 29, 2021","Having dropped out of the French capital's fashion week at the height of the pandemic in April 2020, Saint Laurent made its big comeback to the Parisian calendar on Tuesday evening. And the Kering-owned brand didn't hold back, reconnecting with the fashion week's pre-Covid opulence with a high-impact show hosted in exactly the same location that the label staged its last runway presentation almost two years ago: the Trocadéro esplanade, opposite the glittering Eiffel Tower. An enormous metal structure peppered with spotlights had been erected in the center of the catwalk, around which the models paraded. The first look to appear was a long, curvaceous, white dress, slit up the back, the reflection of which seemed to vibrate along the damp ground. Perched on high platform sandals, with lips painted bright red, the model wore thick-framed black sunglasses and imposing gold jewelry. The tone for the show had been set: impeccable class, radical freedom – and a touch of theater. 

This season's Saint Laurent woman had the gift of being able to show herself off with natural elegance and without worrying about convention. The jacket of one elegant black suit had three large golden buttons, while a long red dress with a plunging neckline was also slit up the front. This was a woman who did not shy away from slipping her purse into the top of her jeans, which she wore bare-chested with only a man's suit jacket. Above all, she had an innate knack for accessorizing and using colors tastefully, effectively elevating a look with a single detail and refining her fiery femme fatale attitude, all while maintaining a careful balance between restraint and extravagance. Here there was a large red flower, applied to the straps of a skintight bodysuit, right in the middle of the model's chest; there, a yellow scarf with black spots, twirled around the neck of a model in a beautiful black coat. Elsewhere, an electric blue turban held one model's hair in place, while a pair of leather gloves in the same color brought a flashy edge to an otherwise dark-toned ensemble. For Spring/Summer 2022, creative director Anthony Vaccarello took inspiration from Paloma Picasso, a great friend of Yves Saint Laurent, for whose collections she made accessories in the 1970s. 

""For a long time now, I've wanted to represent this encounter between Paloma Picasso and Yves Saint Laurent, the importance of which is often underestimated in the couturier's creative development. As a designer, I was particularly sensitive to this moment, because, for me, it's the moment in which Saint Laurent stops making fashion and creates a style,"" explained the designer in his notes. 

Vaccarello therefore cultivated a certain attitude, a conscious taste for eccentricity and originality, all while exploring new pathways through which to concoct a contemporary wardrobe adapted to the needs of the woman of today. Following in the footsteps of Prada, which updated knitted grandpa long-johns with a modern twist last January, this season, Saint Laurent's creative director offered up a Lycra catsuit as the key look of its wardrobe for next summer. It was reimagined in every conceivable shade – in intense single-color looks and exaggerated floral prints – and in a wide range of shapes. Indeed, this Catwoman bodysuit was interpreted with all kinds of variations. The top part of the piece, in particular, was draped in some looks, split in others, and elsewhere it was scalloped, pinned or shaped into a bustier, leaving the model's shoulders bare. 

Vaccarello also had the bright idea of pairing these catsuits with masculine, oversized jackets for a neat twist on traditional tailoring. A classic Prince of Wales jacket was matched with skintight leggings in the same pattern, while another look created the same leggings-and-suit silhouette in gray, tone on tone. A handful of more conventional cotton jumspuits rounded out the wardrobe. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 29, 2021","A genuine “celebration of fashion.” This was how Christelle Kocher, founder and creative director of Koché, described the show unveiling her latest collection, christened ‘Magic Hands’. To a soundtrack by Massive Attack, the show dreamed of the summer to come, drenching with colour the luxurious salons of the prestigious Shangri-La Paris hotel, located in the French capital’s 16th arrondissement. Undoubtedly a safe bet, choosing such a gilded, opulent setting as the backdrop to a collection described as “more refined and elevated than ever,” in which Koché chose to revisit a selection of wardrobe essentials with a “new classics” aesthetic.The yearning to dress up again, without however giving up on the cosy outfits enjoyed in recent months, was the common thread running through a mixed-gender, cheerful and optimistic collection. Simple, chic items, the hallmark of the Parisian label founded in 2015, were back centre stage as an integral part of Koché’s DNA. Sweatshirts and hoodies in pastel printed fabrics, decorated with cool powder pink sequins, knee-length boxer-style shorts, loose, generously cut trousers, and ultra-slinky leggings that took on a sophisticated vibe combined with blazers with plunging necklines or structured crop tops.

Koché’s lavish, highly feminine style featured an overload of 1930s glamour, especially noticeable in the short party dresses with architecturally constructed shoulders, or the ample knitwear in sunny tone-on-tone hues. Embroidery, ostrich feathers, organza silk and the lace details typical of Koché, the 2019 ANDAM prize winner, added a touch of glitz to asymmetrical dresses, halter-neck tops and even tunics and short capes. Koché also discreetly unveiled its new monogram logo, cleverly cached within white open-work dresses. In terms of accessories, some models carried delicate pastel-coloured flowers matching their looks, and the collection also included imposing dark hats and brightly coloured feather slippers.“Emotion is back, as is meeting again and sharing fashion. For me this is a moment of pure poetry, and the whole team is happy and proud to be sharing this collection in physical format with our audience, with journalists and buyers,” said Kocher at the end of the show, after enjoying a few quips and welcoming journalists to her improvised “lounge” on the hotel’s terrace. “I wanted to celebrate dressing up, craftsmanship, things made properly. I was really keen to fête couture, and it seemed very important to return to essentials,” said Kocher, also the creative director of Lemarié, citing as examples the hand-made embroidery, the organza flowers and her reinterpretation of contemporary items with the addition of traditional elements. “I find it very important to draw inspiration from past techniques that are fashion’s heritage, and to feature them in the present while looking towards the future,” she added, mentioning how important it is to forge “alliances” with history.

Connections that also take the form of contemporary collaborations. The show’s surprise element was the appearance of a small logo on the upper left side of an oversize, open-shoulder black top, revisited in the shape of a cocktail dress and enhanced with a hem of red and black ostrich feathers. The recognizable design of a small flame with the Koché x Tinder tag inscribed beneath it heralded the launch of a capsule collection developed by Koché with well-known dating app Tinder. An eight-item genderless line, Tinder's first foray into fashion, including a dress, sweatshirts, t-shirts, a headscarf and a hat.A series of simple, flowing garments with a more affordable positioning than is customary for Koché, their prices ranging from €50 to €245. The collection is available from September 28 at select stores and on Koché's e-shop, which delivers internationally to Spain, the UK, Italy, Japan, the USA and Germany. The profits will be donated to Casa 93, a project run by the ModaFusion association located in Paris’s Seine Saint-Denis district, a fashion school close to Kocher which promotes the training of emerging talents of diverse origin.

“The strength of this collection is that it embodies a generation with many faces,” said Kocher, underlining her satisfaction for collaborating with an app that is “rooted in popular culture” and is representative of “our times and of values that are important to us, such as inclusivity and diversity.”

"Sep 29, 2021","An authentic fan phenomenon occurred in Paris on the night of Monday, September 27, as Marine Serre brought her latest collection, ""Fichu Pour Fichu,"" to the French capital's Musée Carnavalet, closing the first day of Paris Fashion Week. Her faithful followers showed up in force, jostling in the narrow streets of Le Marais, all instantly recognizable in their urban subculture-like uniform, with crescent moons splashed across tops and leggings, pointy boots, denim jackets and even futuristic masks – not to mention the white scarves which, as a nod to the title of the collection, served as the show's invitations. Illuminated by a faint orange light, the gardens of the museum dedicated to the history of Paris welcomed the show's guests, who were subjected to intense health security checks upon arrival. A dozen models, lined up in an orderly fashion in the portico that separated the different areas of the gardens, dominated the attention of the attendees, who whipped out their phones in order to immortalize every detail of the pieces: from delicate embroidery to traditional crochet, via cutlery-inspired jewelry and the label of a pink and purple denim jacket announcing that it had been manufactured using recycled jeans. Indeed, the designer's collection for Spring/Summer 2022 is her most sustainable offering yet, having been produced using 45% recycled and 45% reclaimed materials. Marine Serre stages a futuristic return to her rootsThe voice of Marine Serre herself gave the signal to start the projection of ""Ostal 24,"" a video whose title references the word ""house"" in Occitan, the language of the designer's home region. This short, 13-minute film, which is already available on the brand's website, stood in for a traditional runway show and represented the continuation of the partnership between the designer, winner of the LVMH prize in 2017, and her collaborators, Sacha Barbin and Ryan Doubiago, which began with their collaboration for her Spring/Summer 2021 collection, ""Amor Fati.""

The contemplative video, which echoed with the experience of lockdown, presented the ""optimistic vision"" of the designer, as she reflects on how life will be when there are fewer restrictions and the risk of falling back into ""old habits"" looms. The audiovisual presentation's silent characters came together for a day of communal experiences, during which they carried out actions repeated during the recent months of confinement, from meditation to yoga, dance to tableside family encounters. Everybody wore designs that reflected a kind of archaeology of the past, constructed around the combination and transformation of pieces of fabric taken from home textiles, such as napkins and tablecloths. Deadstocks of leather were also given a second life, while jeans were refreshed and dyed in unique color gradients.

The homely touch could also be seen in the cutlery reinterpreted as earrings and necklaces, as well as in traditional elements, such as crocheted blankets and avant-garde harvest scenes. Overall, there was a bucolic aesthetic, including characteristic Marine Serre patchwork prints in blue and orange tones, which appeared in flowing asymmetrical dresses, leggings and full bodysuits. Linen and cotton were used in pure white looks, some of which featured the designer's early embroidery, or in pieces with lace-like stitching, while recycled silk served to make new collage dresses and corn-fiber textiles were employed in 90s-style shirts. Special mention also goes to the oversized rain coats with visors in shades of chocolate and intense fuchsia. ""I want people to feel the beauty and simplicity of being together and for them to rediscover the happiness of cooking, eating, dancing, doing yoga,"" explained Serre, adding, ""when we are making choices that have an impact every day, how can we be more responsible with the decisions we make? Fashion is more than draping fabric and making a profit. It can be a space where we're free to take meaningful action.""Alsatian tradition, acrobatics and drag queens at Weinsanto Only one hour before and a matter of meters away from the media frenzy that was the Marine Serre show, young, pink-haired designer Victor Weinsanto took over an hôtel particulier on the same street, Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, in order to show his third collection, ""Hopla Geiss."" The show had something of the private performance about it and boasted just over 100 guests, including fellow designers, such as the duo behind EgonLab – the brand that claimed the 2021 Andam Prize's Pierre Bergé Award, or Simon Porte Jacquemus, accompanied, as always, by his dog Toutou. Other attendees included Germain Louvet, of the Opéra de Paris, and drag queen Nicky Doll, who participated in the 12th season of hit TV show RuPaul's Drag Race. 

Trained at Jean-Paul Gaultier, 27-year-old Weinsanto presented a theatrical show with elements of circus, reflected in the performances of his diverse and inclusive cast, which ranged from short scenes, to dance and gymnastics, via a hypnotic session of acrobatics in front of a reinterpretation of a floral patio. This scenery was also brought into corsetry, draperies and satiny fabrics, pieces with plunging necklines, and fitted, transparent black bodysuits. Bleached, distressed denim appeared in a handful of more street-style looks that were responsible for lightening up and balancing out the drama provided by the voluptuous dresses in tones of fuchsia, violet and black, and the lingerie-like propositions with shimmering capes. 

Mixed in with all of this were illustrations by Clément Louis in tribute to Weinsanto's favorite model and muse, Queentoide, as well as references to Alsatian culture. XXL versions of the region's characteristic bows and headdresses topped looks, as did reinterpretations of pretzels, while kelsch, a linen and cotton fabric made in Alsace, was used to bring some couture creations to life and certain giant bags referenced the typical kougelhopf cake. 

""This collection is a tribute to my origins, to Alsace. I wanted to present a very personal collection about my story, mixing feelings and family memories,"" explained a visibly emotional Weinsanto after the show. ""I wanted to use humor and change the meaning of these traditional codes, honored by my grandmothers,"" he continued. As it happens, one of these grandmothers also played a part in the runway presentation, as her voice could be heard in the recording of the regional song used to open the show.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 28, 2021","It says a great deal about the openness of Paris to fresh ideas when the opening show of the city’s biggest fashion week – women’s ready-to-wear - is given over to a young designer like Kenneth Ize. 
The Nigerian-born and Austrian-raised Ize’s big theme was his own African origins, and the phrase 'Third World,' and the result was a moving collection based on traditional African materials reimagined in a cosmopolitan context. Staged in an upper floor of the Palais de Tokyo, the Paris museum that is the largest center of contemporary artistic creation in Europe.
 
Like in his debut menswear collections, the key material was aso oke, meaning top cloth, a hand-woven fabric created by the Yoruba people, with beautifully graphic grids and charming geometry. Ize focused on intense color coordination – one sea-blue tunic and shorts even had matching Birkenstocks.  Though he often completed languid aso oke pajama suits with mono-color linen waistcoats. Throughout there was a rock-star mood, even if Ize’s heroes are light years away from bling-bling. Instead he references his roots in African culture with raw fabrics and vibrant earthy colors.
 
Ize is also a very talented cutter, especially his marvelous men’s shirts finished with cathedral high collars, so towering they made Karl Lagerfeld’s Hilditch & Key shirts look like crewnecks. 
“I am switching back and forth from Africa. And that term, Third World Country, comes into my mind always. That’s how many people see me. Even if my western friends cannot know what that means. But that term limits you because it doesn’t push you up, it brings you down. And, so this a new dawn for me,” he said in tears, as a documentary camera crew followed him around the backstage and then into a separate lounge.
 
Though primarily noted as a menswear designer, this collection was co-ed, and boasted fringed dresses and broad striped shirts and tunics for women in the same same fabric used for men.
 
“I wanted to say how important women are to the world. And how we men actually try to control their bodies which is really sad. We have been taught 'pink for women and blue for boys' and I wanted to play around that,” he added.
 
Pre-pandemic we wrote the someone should really name Ize creative director of a historic European house and let his talent rip. After this fine display, that remains our opinion.

"Sep 28, 2021","The Real Leather. Stay Different. International Student Design Competition has announced its first-ever winner: Emily Omesi, a BFA undergraduate at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York.The competition, which challenged students around the world to design apparel, footwear or accessories using at least 50% leather, attracted almost 400 entries from 36 countries, representing 58 different nationalities.
 
Entitled “Bacterial Genetics,” Omesi’s winning entry is a leather jacket inspired by cell scans from her brother’s research on infectious diseases. The jacket, which is made from 100% cow leather, also channels 80s influences into a cropped cut and exaggerated dolmen sleeves with sculptured swirls.Four runners-up made it to the final of the competition, including Meghan Beattie from Birmingham City University, UK; Nathalie Hauser from Kolding School of Design, Denmark; Teresita Marrero Escalona from Universidad del Azuay, Ecuador; and Alice Morgan from the University of Derby, UK.
 
Launched this year in association with ArtsThread and Rollacoaster magazine, the competition, which is funded by the Leather & Hide Council of America (L&HCA), seeks to inspire the next generation of designers to work with natural, sustainable and responsibly produced leather.
 
The judging panel of the inaugural competition included Katie Greenyer of the Pentland Group, fashion stylist Mike Adler and Milan Miladinov, art director at Rollacoaster magazine. In line with the prize’s focus on sustainability, the judges were looking for durable pieces that could last a lifetime.  
“In a world increasingly threatened by human activity, where waste is piling up and oceans flooding with plastic, it is up to every single one of us to make a change,” commented L&HCA president Steve Sothmann in a release. “Promoting slow fashion and encouraging the use of sustainable materials like leather, that would otherwise end up in landfill, is at the core of what we do.”

"Sep 26, 2021","Bringing everyone together in the same creative élan: this was the mad project that Francesco Risso managed to pull off at Milan Fashion Week on Saturday, orchestrating a memorable show that offered the Lombard capital a moving moment of communion and pure fashion. For his return to the runway, the designer wanted to throw out the rule book and break down barriers by dressing everybody in Marni. And that's just what he did. Besides the models, the house's collaborators, technicians and seamstresses, as well as the artists participating in the show, special guests, stars, friends of the brand, and journalists all wore jackets, pants or cotton coats that had been reclaimed from Marni's stock and repainted by hand with thick vertical stripes, each piece bearing a large label with a red border which read ""Marniphermalia.""

Each guest also had their face half-covered by a striped scarf from the house, which not only hid their masks but also made everyone look alike, as though integrated into a single community. In order to set this enormous plan in motion, the runway's approximately 500 guests were invited to the OTB-owned brand's showroom for a fitting a few days before the event. Suffice to say, it all implied gargantuan levels of organization. Everything came together on Saturday evening, in a circular theater constructed like a makeshift life raft from planks of wood. The catwalk was a spiraling walkway leading the models in a never-ending circuit that accompanied the rows of seats where spectators were sitting, wearing striped clothing just like them. The show's musicians were the first to descend this structure with their instruments and take their place in the arena. Then the singers positioned themselves at different points around the space, standing upright among the audience members. The circular motion continued naturally with the entrance of the models, who made up an incredibly diverse cast, including men and women of all ages, sizes and backgrounds. They stepped on and off the central runway, before heading in the opposite direction, in a continuous back and forth. Among them, Rizzo himself had slipped onto his own runway incognito, walking barefoot and wrapped in an XXL scarf with thin stripes that flowed down to the floor. Here and there, one could also make out other familiar faces, including that of Italian rapper Ghali. 

The designer chose two main themes for this Spring/Summer 2022 collection: ""stripes, which are used throughout, create meaning, connect things together,"" and daisies, ""which grow resiliently, disconnecting and reconnecting."" There were therefore a lot of thick, graphically impactful pop stripes, seen in two-tone outfits in black and white, but also in tones of yellow, blue, white and red. These two-tone stripes were particularly present in spiral constructions, making it look as though the fabric had been wrapped around the body in the case of one figure-hugging dress.

Risso notably reinterpreted the classic marinière top, transforming it into an ample blue and white poncho-tunic with large panels of striped fabric that had been sewn together. Daisies also recalled the fun iconography of the 1970s, channeling a spirit that was simultaneously ""peace and love"" and Hawaiian. Gigantic versions of the flowers appeared on some pieces, while elsewhere they were peppered across pants and bodysuits to create dainty little white patterns.  

Different colors of daisy were also assembled to create bouquet-like skirts and minidresses, while one giant white flower decorated the front of a silk pyjama suit with navy and golden-orange stripes. As for the shoes, they definitely won the prize for the most desirable accessory of the season. They were all woven and painted, socks included, to exactly replicate the classic footwear pieces of top brands, from moccasins with chains to black canvas sneakers with white laces. A few moments of pure emotion punctuated the performance staged by Risso and Babak Radboy, as, for example, when poet Mykki Blanco took the mic in order to recite one of her texts, or when singer Zsela performed the first note of a melancholic tune – almost a spiritual chant – by composer Dev Hynes, accompanied by the warm voices of the choristers spread around the showspace. 

A final turn around the runway and the applause exploded. Everyone, models and audience alike, clapped and rushed together at the center of the stage to embrace each other. The emotion was palpable.

After a year and half of pandemic, this collective experience, where everyone could take part in the project, seemed to give a new meaning to fashion. While most houses have returned to their usual High Mass-like runway shows as though nothing has happened, Risso looks to be the only designer in Milan who decided to change his approach and propose a new way of thinking.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 26, 2021","Milan Fashion Week has once again shone a spotlight on new creative visions imagined by inventive designers, not all of whom are necessarily young, but who all know the sector well and are now positioning themselves on the market with original and relevant projects. This weekend, in particular, the already well-established brand, MSGM, showed what it's worth, alongside new labels Shi.RT, led by Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, and Vitelli, the knitwear brand from Mauro Simionato. For its return to the runway, MSGM chose as its venue the park in the new neighborhood of Porta Nuova, with its beds of lavender and herbs growing at the foot of skyscrapers. Designer Massimo Giorgetti sent out a group of joyful and cheeky young girls with rainbow-colored beach sandals, visors and little lunchboxes. The looks were fresh and dapper with a markedly summery style. 

The fabrics, which included cotton, jersey and stretch, were all about lightness, and were used in midriff-bearing outfits that exuded a youthful and relaxed spirt, while vibrant and fluorescent colors infused the ensembles with energy. In particular, this effect could be seen in frilled crop-tops and elastic bras that were worn over other clothes for a flashy touch. Giorgetti also played with checks, from classic gingham – used in shorts, blouses, pants, tops, skirts and polos in shades of pink, green and orange – to the tartan seen in tweed jackets with frayed edges. He also worked in a series of flowery prints that ranged from 70s-style florals to patterns channeling impressionist paintings. Dresses and lacy tracksuits completed the easy-to-wear and highly desirable wardrobe. There was a punchy pop atmosphere over at Shi.RT, the brand founded by Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi in 2019, which focuses on cotton shirts and dresses. Over the course of the last few seasons, the label's offering has expanded to include tops, skirts and pants, all while staying faithful to its original concept. The products are 100% Italian and can be worn by both young women and more mature ladies, all while boasting a relatively accessible price tag. Shirts are sold for 98-100 euros, while prices for more elaborate dresses don't rise beyond 500 euros. 

The strategy seems to be working for the brand. ""Last season, in the middle of the pandemic, our sales jumped up 30%. We're currently in around 50 top boutiques, in China and Taiwan, but also in Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, France and Belgium. Even with less money, our customers are prepared to spend, but they want a real product that they can put on,"" confided Rimondi backstage. 

For next summer, the design duo have taken inspiration from the colors of Yves Saint Laurent and the chromatic shapes of American designer Stephen Burrows, as well as the paintings of a Dutch artist they discovered on Instagram. The result was a bold, multicolored and shimmery collection. 

The pieces, all of which were made in three types of cotton – poplin, cady and gaufré – were easy-to-wear and were always elevated with a twist, from 80s-inspired pointed shoulders to large bows tied at the waist with a pair of sleeves, as though models had wrapped a shirt around their hips. Most notably, however, the designers used sequins of all sizes and colors in order to brighten up the vast majority of looks on the runway. Vitelli, for its part, represents one of the most interesting new developments in Italian-made fashion and is currently distributed in a dozen of the hottest stores around the world. Taking inspiration from nomads and the hippie movement, the brand's latest collection was unveiled on Friday, in the 10 Corso Como outlet, where Carla Sozzani herself made an appearance in order to provide encouragement for designer Mauro Simionato during his first ever runway show. 

""We are the multi-ethnic punks of Italian couture,"" proclaimed the brand in a note setting the tone for the show. The label's knitwear pieces with loose, extra-long sleeves were delicate and fine, almost transparent, creating an impression of fragility. Some coats and pants seemed to have been embroidered with a complex tangle of threads. Other pieces were composed of knits that looked like felt, while the stripes of maxi-ponchos were stretched into natural curves. The looks had a coarse, almost primitive style. 

""It's experimental knitwear inspired by the Italian musical movement from 1979-80, Cosmic, and by the youth of today. The challenge was to show all the typologies and treatments that we've developed over the last few years, while also presenting Vitelli as a contemporary label that's full of Italian style,"" explained Simionato.

Born in Veneto, the 39-year-old designer founded the label in 2016 after years of experience in the sector, firstly as the founder of Milanese multi-brand showroom 247 and footwear label Volta, then as consultant creative director for brands including Belstaff, Barena, Golden Goose and Clarks. His encounter with knitwear specialist Giulia Bortoli was a fundamental experience that introduced him to the world of knits.

This was the start of Vitelli, a collective of a dozen creative artisans, who conduct experiments with thread, reclaiming the ends of spools that are usually thrown away, as well as threads from textile offcuts, to create hybrid textures partway between knits and fabrics.

"Sep 26, 2021","In a season where Milan fashion began rebounding from the pandemic, there was plenty to see away from the catwalk. We caught up with three young designers thinking way out of the box.
 Quira: Fabulous forbidden dreams
 
There’s a new fashion star in the firmament in Milan. Her name is Veronica Leoni. Her brand is called Quira.Named after Quirina, the nickname of the grandmother of Leoni, a designer who hails from Rome and has a hyper impressive CV. From head knitwear designer for Jil Sander herself to pre-collection head of Celine, under Phoebe Philo. Her resume wouldn’t matter a toss if Leoni didn’t have real talent. But flair and ability she clearly has in spades. 
 
On a sunny afternoon, she presented her first collection inside a showroom normally used in Milan for hipster designer dinners. And, quite frankly, this was the most impressive debut in Milan in many years.
 
Quira is all about sculptural shapes but made almost nonchalantly: an oversized fine wool scarf wrapped and knotted into a fabulous skirt, a mannish check shirt twisted into a layered posh punk skirt, or a sheath of liquid silver draped into a gown worthy of Isadora Duncan.
 
""It’s my forbidden dreams. It’s very primitive. It’s five of us, just friends. I worked in London three times in my life, the latest was with Phoebe at Celine. Then I came back to Rome in 2017 and decided to create something personal. And during the pandemic we put this together. I wanted to create a bubble and be obstinate,"" explained Leoni.
 
Leoni’s clothes drape, droop, seemingly fall off the shoulders, but all ever so gracefully. Her tailoring – large trenches, raincoats worn askew – is oversized, enveloping but always flattering. Plus, there is lots of quirky energy, as in one putty gray deconstructed leather carpenter’s apron that recalled a Claes Oldenburg soft sculpture.
 
Made in the finest of Italian fabrics in first-rate factories, the collection feels to the hand to be very high quality, especially its fabrics. Her creations are blessed with a certain lightness; their volumes mean they float yet never look flimsy.
 
""I’m on my knees most of the time pinning trousers and clothes. Trying to create a sense of space. Draping really excites me, the way that fabrics behave spontaneously. I am very tactile and play with fluidity along side very structured tailoring. I like that eclecticism,"" said this Roman and Romanista, since she supports FC Roma football club.
 
Moreover, the whole Quira project came fully conceived with complimentary accessories – arty medieval clog boots or a series of soft mid-size totes. There were even a few poetic menswear looks.

""My first time doing menswear and it came out spontaneously. It’s a great opportunity for me to challenge gender with a more expanded view. I want to be sophisticated for everybody. I want to fit a lot of characters and not be niche,"" Leoni concluded 
 
Ever since Philo retired three years back, fashionistas have been on a Holy Grail-esque quest to find her successor. Turns out they did not have to look that far. Just go to Rome.
 Plan C x Perimetro Tokyo

Plan C is the fledgling fashion house of Carolina Castiglioni, a sophisticated Milanese designer with a thing for Tokyo. Hence her latest project, a gallery show and creative hook-up with path-breaking magazine and art group Perimetro in a special edition devoted to Japan.
 
The result was a great collection of images shot by eight photographers – Japanese, Italian and French – of Tokyo, ranging from studies of ancient barbers and dark and twisting inner-city elevated highways and rivers, to eccentric cityscapes and quirky bars – all the things that make Tokyo unique.
 
""Tokyo is my favorite foreign city, and where I find so much inspiration. So I loved the idea behind this concept, of seeing Tokyo from so many different angles,"" the designer explained. 
 
The images were all displayed on huge rolls of fabric suspended inside the art gallery in south Milan, in an exhibition entitled ""Tokyo and its Contemporary Storytellers.""
 
Alongside them, Plan C produced a limited-edition selection of pristine T-shirts on which were sewn fine fabric reproductions of the Tokyo photos. 
 
Parallel to that, there was a selection of novel everyday Japanese products – from curling shears to teapots – in yet another example of Plan C’s very particular manner of mingling art and commerce.
 Arthur Arbesser: Bucolic on Via Della Spiga

Always a novel voice in the fashionable firmament of Milan, Arthur Arbesser created a pop-up that was as much a gallery as a showspace this season.
 
The designer named it ""Arthur Arbesser Casa,"" the latest use of the space as part of a project called ""Visiting Installation Art"" (VIA), a series of curations in multiple disciplines, displayed in vacant storefronts in order to restart the Milanese economy. Located on the luxe shopping street of Via Della Spiga, it featured a marvelous hand-painted Matisse-like fairytale backdrop and all sorts of witty works of recycling, along with objects for the home.  
 
""What’s the point of throwing out DHL and Amazon boxes, when you can turn them into flowers,"" smiled Arbesser who had pots of these hand-painted scissor-cut ""dried flowers"" as décor.
 
His new collection was similarly naïve with long, childlike silhouettes or boxy, boyish shirts made in papery Japanese poplin or techy nylons. Quirky check frocks with huge patch pockets, hand-painted with images of bucolic gardens, or patchwork check prints made into plissé gowns – all topped by great crocheted straw bullfighters’ caps.
 
All very carefree, and very Arthur.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 26, 2021","While Tod's, Missoni, Prada and Versace conducted High Mass with their usual traditional runway shows at Milan Fashion Week on Friday, a number of young brands, including Act N°1 and Sunnei, stood out for their original presentations, offering live performances and exciting experiments. Act N°1 dazzled with a sumptuous Spring/Summer 2022 collection which transported the runway's guests to a grand aristocratic 19th-century ball. Luca Lin and Galib Gassanoff, the young designers who launched the brand in 2016 and who have been showing in Milan for seven seasons, unveiled an inventive hybrid wardrobe, mixing historical references and modern codes with the goal of tearing apart the corseted garments of the past and explosively freeing the female body.

The show opened with a string quintet taking their places in the dark and spacious venue, packed with spectators. Then the first model set the tone, stepping out in an elegant black suit, a cloud of tulle draped over her shoulder like a fur stole.As though attending a gala event, models with floor-length braids took turns on the runway in sumptuous looks, where the tulle that has become the brand's signature was transformed into trains, long capes, turquoise maxi-tutus, voluminous petticoats that seemed to peek out from under every garment, and spectacularly regal ball gowns.Every look had been reinterpreted in a bold, contemporary version. So the dress and crinoline was reimagined as a trench, while the denim jacket was elevated with pleats and puffy sleeves, and stretched into a maxi-coat thanks to removable stretches of fabric. The blouse featured in one trouser set in sky blue duchesse satin was transformed into a mini cape. 

One chic taffeta dress opened at the top to reveal the front of the model's bra, while a cream-colored satin sheath rolled down to give a glimpse of a black bustier. Elsewhere it was strappy panties that could be seen sticking out of the top of a pair of low-waisted trousers. 

Finally, there were the sublime bodices, dresses and maxi-coats in painted silk with which Act N°1 has made its name. These delicate garments glided down the runway with soft sensuality, displaying their landscapes, flowers and foliage, which looked to have been painted in watercolors. The show concluded with three grandiose period dresses, which were then split open to free the models beneath, the last of whom danced across the runway en pointe for the grand finale. Over at Sunnei, the decor was radically different. The ""extreme"" experience promised by the brand in its invitation began behind the little door of a large hangar. The audience was plunged into complete darkness and directed towards a faint light in the distance. Here they received a little white fabric bag, as an authoritative voice forbade them from opening it. ""Hey you, stop! Don't open the bag,"" it warned, before menacingly adding ""I can see you."" 

The brand's guests were then sent off down a long, dark corridor, where they had to find their number, written in white on a white floor. It was standing in this exact spot that they would be able to watch the show, having finally been allowed to open the mysterious little bag and put on the sunglasses it contained, which somewhat resembled swimming goggles, but which were, in fact, exactly the same model of glasses that would be worn by the show's models. 

Due to the all-enveloping darkness, some guests inadvertently found their way to some rows of seats that had been set up backstage and ended up missing the whole show. Meanwhile, in the adjacent tunnel – an installation designed by Milanese architecture firm 2050+ – a blinding white light suddenly illuminated the runway, where the models were intermittently spotlighted by syncopated strobe effects. As though by magic, the avatars created by design duo Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo for the last two seasons' virtual shows came to life before the audience's eyes, wearing real clothes that were both sharply cut and brightly colored. Different chromatic combinations were mixed and matched in a kaleidoscopic jumble which saw, for example, red slippers paired with a sage green outfit. 

Elsewhere, the designers alternated thick two-tone stripes, which clashed in contrasting horizontal and vertical orientations, with monochrome pieces, such as a turquoise shirt with cut-outs or an oversized poppy-colored suit. They also had fun brushing a hasty lick of paint over some pieces, as in a periwinkle blue coat that revealed its original whiteness in spots that the painter's hand looked to have rushed over – under the collar and near the seams. 

The silhouettes were relaxed, playing with volumes achieved with loose interchangeable tops and long pants that were either baggy or flared. Among all of this, the emphasis was on the brand's new bags with beaded fringes, as well as the other accessories, including the sunglasses that were distributed to the audience at the start of the show and which will no doubt be all the rage next summer.

"Sep 25, 2021","In a busy Saturday in Milan, Giorgio went Zen master in his private palazzo, Dolce & Gabbana presented disco damsels, Ermanno Scervino refocused with force and Salvatore Ferragamo had a tricky delivery.Zen master Giorgio Armani

It felt like the good old days on Saturday night with Giorgio Armani, who staged his show in the custom-built basement showroom of his personal palazzo, at Via Borgonuovo 21.The scene of many of his triumphs in the 20th century, when he championed Italian fashion and imposed his haut de gamme tailored vision of la moda. This century nearly all his shows happen in the Tadao Ando-designed headquarters in south Milan.
 
Armani was in Zen master form, creating a score of fresh silhouettes, pairing delicate and dainty jackets and boleros with languidly cut pants – from dhotis and palazzo pants to gaucho shapes.
 
Natty nomadism with remarkable levity, half the fabrics seemed to float gently off the body. Presented before an endless oceanic vista and backed by a series of classic Italian ballads, including the delightfully named ""Linked by a Grain of Sand"" by Nico Fidenco.
 
This was also one of those tailoring master classes Giorgio pulls off every few years, the sheer draping, artful construction of shoulders and sense of proportion was something hundreds of lesser talents could only dream of achieving.
 
All made in dreamy hues of putty, light purple and lichen, with dashes of red. The ethereal atmosphere heightened by the knit or silver chiffon booties and faux serpent-skin flats that anchored most looks.
 
Maintaining a house tradition, there was the odd burst of applause mid-show for an especially stylish passage. Before a beaming Giorgio took his bow in front of the giant video of a sunset on the Med. 
 
He will not go quietly into that good night. 
Dolce & Gabbana: Disco damsels
 
Disco damsels and none of them in distress at Dolce & Gabbana, with a blockbuster show where the designers took their bow in a puff of virtual crystal, within a hologram.
 
It was a show that underlined just how revealing and body conscious Italian fashion has become this season. And how concerned about good health. Unlike in London last weekend, fresh masks were handed out at every major show, and ushers quietly went around reminding all guests to keep them on.
 
In an Italian season of micro-minis, the duo opened with microscopic versions worn with oversized rocker jackets. Few creators love strass as much as Domenico and Stefano, who whipped up crystal-studded and shiny beaded bras, bikinis, tanks and belts. Before going into overdrive with Byzantine quantities of bejeweled boleros, parkas and jean jackets, paired with mega-ripped sailor’s jeans – all worn proudly by every model.
 
And for after the afterparty, there were posh-dominatrix leotards, lace-up bustiers and multiple frilly lace combinations. A concept that climaxed with a brilliant visual pun: a leotard in piano keys with a big tuxedo lapel, one of several humorous twists in a rockin’ show. They even dreamed up a great new category of fatigue boots, with multiple little cargo pockets, made in aged denim or great camouflage. 
 
These were very much gals on maneuver, though generally at the better sort of nightclub. Driven on by a churning soundtrack of Black Legend techno funk, this was Domenico and Stefano doing what they do best – high-octane baroque exuberance for the proud.
  
Ermanno Scervino cleans up his act
 
Venetian voluptuousness and Tuscan tenacity par excellence at Ermanno Scervino, with a tougher, more focused statement by the designer that made for a fine morning show.
 
A hyper-inclusive cast strutting their stuff over the marble floors and cobblestones of a colonnaded 17th-century palazzo, with guests like Carine Roitfeld, Edward Enninful and Anna Dello Russo sitting in upholstered front row armchairs. The ideal setting for the racy femme fatale look that is Scervino’s signature.
 
At times, Ermanno’s collections can get a little twee and saccharine. Not this season, where the sense of self-editing was much better.
 
Best of all, Scervino’s first-rate atelier was in excellent health – whipping up sexy leather cocktails interspersed with lace and creating a sensational layered white leather-lace mini cocktail. One great Jackie O white leather suit – with mini and caban – even featured a leather lace bra.
 
Few designers love a feather as much as Ermanno, who laced cock plumes into gilded lace columns, barely-there lace cocktails, cashmere sweaters and shantung mini dresses.
 
""Each garment is an eco-system to be discovered,"" explained Scervino.
 
And even when the concept got too much – as it did in his open-sided green Aran sweater sprouting feathers – you had to admire the designer’s chutzpah.
 
Add in some classy shearling bombers and workers' jackets finished with his gothic logo, and the high-gloss nylon parkas that are de rigueur in today’s Milan and the result was plucky and polished fashion pizzazz. And Ermanno’s best show in many seasons.Salvatore Ferragamo: New design team, same problems
 
A new design team, but the same problems at Salvatore Ferragamo, where the new direction showed little to suggest that there is a clear road to recovery for this storied brand.
 
Digitally backward, and suffering from an unfocused design concept, the famed Florentine brand had gone into a tailspin during the pandemic, posting heavy losses.
 
With the net result that the family-controlled house hired a new CEO, Marco Gobbetti from Burberry, to turn things around. It looks like he has his work cut out for him.
 
The overwhelming feeling when looking at these clothes was of a designer trying hard to loosen up the mood at Ferragamo but not really succeeding. Struggling even, as the opening look was clearly mis-sewn at the back. 
 
Oversized hyper-high-waist trousers paired with skimpy crepe blouses; falling-off-the-shoulders, nun-like silk frocks; governess bedtime nighties; and a bias-cut, slashed white poplin dress that looked like old, chopped-up family sheets.
 
For guys, flared pleated pants; Terylene-like fisherman’s tops; weirdly oversized stamped leather parkas; ribbed V-neck sweaters in burnt orange and washed-out turquoise. Like nice son-in-laws trying too hard to be cool.

Which sums up this collection, a weak attempt to suddenly make an uptight brand into something cool.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2021","The odd thing about attending Versace’s runway show at Milan Fashion Week on Friday night was that all anyone could talk about was what Donatella was going to announce on Sunday evening. 
Emails this week had summoned a score of leading writers and editors to meet Donatella, and speculation had it that she would announce an unprecedented collaboration with Kim Jones and Fendi.
 
It was a slight pity that this drew so much focus, as the Versace collection actually unveiled on Friday was a pure expression of the house’s DNA: dramatic heraldic and baroque prints, suggestive cocktails, bravura silk shirts and impeccable tailoring. Even if there was little sense of anything revolutionary in this coed show, at least the scarves took the collection somewhere new. Nonetheless, with the house’s new owners, led by Capri CEO John D. Idol, sitting front-row, you sensed that this was a collection often inspired by the demands of the merchandising department. 
 
Donatella signaled the start of the action with a dozen young shirtless lotharios wearing black trousers, with logo underwear visible, gold necklaces and black masks, who climbed onto ladders and began – punkha wallah style – to pull ropes and undulate an 800-square-meter sheet of patchwork foulards up and down. Oddly, their action created no cooling breeze in the basement show-space. But these silks were the key to this collection, appearing in multiple looks and adding plenty of kick.
 
""The foulard is a fundamental component of Versace’s heritage and character. The foulard has been with us from the very beginning of the brand, but this season turns everything on its head. It is no longer fluid or dreamy, the scarf is provocative, sexy, wound tight,"" stressed Donatella, whose invitation came in a silk pochette.
 
Donatella proceeded to send a fab frisson through the socially distanced audience by opening with Dua Lipa in a razor-sharp suit – the one-medusa-buttoned jacket sliced at the side, the skirt below the knee.
 
""It’s been such an incredible experience to continue my journey with my Versace family, from starring in a campaign to now opening the SS22 show! Donatella, it’s been my dream to walk in your show,"" said Lipa, whose song ""Physical"" was the main soundtrack.
 
Donatella also injected the noble prints into menswear – as silk shirts, cummerbunds, jacket collars or the backs of crazy trenches. Other lads marched in muscle-top tanks reading ""Versace Dream via Gesù."" Perhaps we could have done without the dry woolen purple logo baseball jackets. A series of classy totes in either black leather or baroque paisley, and finished with gold chains and attached micro purses and clutches, also looked like best sellers.
 Sadly, there was also a nigh-on wardrobe malfunction with Gigi Hadid, the American beauty who recently had her first child and looked to be very uncomfortably squeezed into an updated Liz Hurley safety pin dress.
 
Often the best looks for women were the simplest, like the leather suit made up of a tuxedo jacket fastened by a gold safety pin and a short skirt slashed at the side. Or even the wow-factor phosphate turquoise bustier cocktail dress worn by Imaan Hammam. Talk about unmistakably Versace at 100 meters.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2021","Sportmax took spectators into the fourth dimension this season. Unveiled in Milan on Friday, the refined Spring/Summer 2022 collection from Max Mara's youth line combined a futuristic atmosphere with strong echoes of the past. It was a wardrobe made up of bold pieces that spliced together the richness of the baroque and the purity of minimalism. The first models, dressed in head-to-toe white looks, made their way down the catwalk as though in Limbo, in an immaculate yet soft environment where the silence was only broken by isolated metallic notes. With their deconstructed outfits, their imposing platform sandals with satin ribbons and their ultra-light futuristic glasses, they looked like creatures from outer-space. 

Their looks were the result of overlapping impalpable fabrics, such as tulle, satin, gazar and silk georgette, with more robust materials, like cotton, denim and leather, through clever construction that nonetheless gave the impression of having been totally improvised, as though the pieces had been sculpted off the cuff, with the fabric having been cinched, pleated and folded around the models' bodies by an artistic hand. The legendary artistic duo of avant-garde musician John Cage and American choreographer Merce Cunningham, famous for having revolutionized contemporary dance, was the inspiration behind this collection, where references to dance were omnipresent.

Ribbons, bustiers, leotards, leggings and tulle all put in an appearance, offered up in the delicate palette of the dancer: white, ecru, nude, pale pink. Everything evoked the world of ballet, in particular, the pieces in mesh and jersey. There were also interlaced ribbons, cords and drawstrings which rouched up sleeves or whole garments to add extra dimensions as they intertwined and twisted around asymmetrical, elongated silhouettes. ""We started with the concept of a break. We wanted to break with existing schemas in order to find new ways of constructing something around the body,"" explained creative director Grazia Malagoli backstage. ""The idea was to work with oppositions and contrasts by mixing the hyper-decorative baroque with the simplicity of minimalism, the skintight garments of dancers with more theatrical pieces featuring 3D decorations and effects,"" she continued. 

On the one hand, dresses were draped or ruffled at the sides, sketching out the silhouettes of the basques and panniers of the 18th century. Jackets took on the guise of redingotes or were cinched around the back with lacing or corset fastenings. On the other, fine tulle tunics in nude tones were worn over trousers, leaving the models' bras visible. Everything was light, imperceptible, evanescent.

"Sep 25, 2021","Following the sporty runway presentation from Boss, which opened proceedings in a baseball stadium, the second day of Milan Fashion Week ended beautifully on Thursday, with two playful shows that were full of freshness and fantasy. MM6 chose to show at La Belle Aurore, a Milanese bar with a deliciously retro charm, while GCDS revealed a futuristic aquatic film that was equal parts quirky and fantastical. For its first physical show in Milan, MM6, which has previously shown in London and New York, went all out. Having shown on the Italian calendar for two seasons, Maison Margiela's contemporary line, which was launched in 1997 and is still designed by an anonymous collective, took over La Belle Aurore, an authentic-feeling bar with fashionably outdated decor that's remained unchanged for more than 30 years. In fact, the show commandeered the whole street around the bar, setting up an expansive terrace where guests could sip on aperitifs while they waited for the fun to start. 

As waiters in black jackets ducked in and out of the bar with trays full of drinks, the show's spectators could sample snacks charmingly presented in little white boxes, placed atop red and white checked napkins that also served as invitations. ""The idea was for all of us to meet up again finally, and to celebrate this reunion with a drink, in a celebratory spirit,"" explained a house spokesperson. The atmosphere was good natured, with neighbors stepping out onto their front steps to watch the commotion with curiosity. Suddenly, the first model, dressed in a white suit featuring a jacket with three sleeves, strode down from the end of the street and entered the bar. She was followed by another model in a black satin sheath and long, glamourous gloves. That's when the party started. The Fellini-inspired soundtrack mixed Nino Rota classics with Italian hits from the 1950s to create a very Dolce Vita ambiance. As always, the collection was inspired by the archives of the inventive Martin Margiela and featured more than a touch of irreverence, as seen in a kraft paper suit that was cinched with a belt made of string. 

Then, out of nowhere, the show took a turn, transforming into a kind of Halloween parade with a series of looks featuring a psychedelic harlequin pattern and large clown-like ruffs, not to mention a net top that resembled a giant spiderweb. There was even a pointy witch hat and a gothic black dress with a jagged hem. 

It is into an entirely different universe that GCDS seeks to transport viewers with its chic and sexy, dreamlike video, directed by designer Giuliano Calza, which takes place in a futuristic red planet-esque environment with never-ending dunes. ""I imagined an island, a fantastical underwater world where I would like to have gone after the dark period that we have been through,"" explains Calza. 

""The aesthetic is light and summery, a bit 70s, with a very glam side and thousands of crystals. As though I've recreated Studio 54 on an island,"" muses the designer, who has upped his game once again with this ultra-rich collection, which focuses on details and embellishments. Perched on maxi-platform sandals with vertiginous 25cm heels, the models walk through their mysterious environment in sparkly, ultra-short outfits. Lurex cardigans allude to the sun setting over the sea with a red-orange-pink dégradé that finally plunges into gray-blue. A pair of denim shorts is covered in teardrop-shaped stones, while certain tracksuits are sprinkled with a shower of sequins. Mini tulle tunics are also decorated with crystals. On a handful of pop-print pieces, one can make out characters from hit Japanese manga series One Piece. 

The marine theme, as seen through the playful prism of GCDS, runs through the whole of this Spring/Summer 2022 collection. The One Piece ""Straw Hat Pirates"" skull and crossbones logo is repeated to make up the structure of a cut-out crochet dress elevated with cabochon emeralds. The same pattern also appears in a look combining a top with a maxi-fringed miniskirt. Elsewhere, three panels of organza in the shape of a wave come together to create a jacket featuring different shades of blue, while an impalpable azure blouse recalls the sea. 

Coats in pink denim seem to have been bleached by the sun and saltwater. Retro swimming caps are crocheted like fishnets and decorated with pearls. Large raffia hats and bags complete the wardrobe, which has been designed with vacations and a return to happier times in mind. ""I had a lot of fun making this collection. Everything seems simple at first glance, but there's a huge amount of craftsmanship and research behind each piece,"" emphasizes Calza. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic was far from the minds of designers presenting their collections on the catwalks of London Fashion Week, which set out a vision of a more colorful, optimistic, and dynamic mood than has been seen in the past several months. Among the key trends spotted during the week's shows were bright colors -- yellow in particular -- as well as frills, flowers, and a multitude of outfits remixing work dress codes with casual styles.In the same vein as New York Fashion Week, London's presentations showed us what the wardrobe of the post-covid world should look like. And one thing is sure, we're not likely to get bored with our vestimentary options. After months of inactivity, gloom, and isolation, it's time to make way for life, spontaneity, and, perhaps most of all, optimism. Gone are the jogging suits, pyjamas, and pairs of Crocs -- or maybe not -- make way for tulle, floral prints and accessories, including some ultra-eccentric ones, all of which bring energy and vibrancy to the dullest looks -- if there are any dull looks still around.

In fashion, a return to normal translates into a rainbow of colors, each more daring than the last. The trend was already spotted in the Big Apple and was bolstered by the London shows, but with a subtle difference; in the British capital, the color yellow was the starring shade for women's spring-summer 2022 wardrobes. Buttery soft, bright, or vibrant, yellow will be everywhere next summer, according to several major houses, including Molly Goddard, Roksanda, Richard Quinn, David Koma, and Emilia Wickstead. And so yellow gets added to the green, pink, blue, purple, and red seen in New York, all colors that will energize your post-pandemic wardrobe.And to accompany this sunny color, brands showing in London also bet big on flowers. Whether romantic, country style or a more bohemian spirit, ditsy or oversized, rustic or inspired by exotic destinations, the floral print will be everywhere next summer, covering all kinds of dresses, as seen at Erdem and other labels. Flowers will also show up as an all-over look, but also on pants, and even on long coats.A mix of delicate and extravagant, frills also made recurring appearances on the London catwalks. Meters and meters of tulle and bows -- already seen in New York --  flounced through the looks, often pleated or crumpled. After the trying period of the past several months, now it's necessary to add fun details that do not go unnoticed, ideally ones that are colorful and bring movement and dynamism to each outfit.Last but not least, workwear made a return to the catwalk at the same time that many men and women are returning to the joys of the office. However, it wasn't about classic suits and ensembles, as we were previously used to. In London, the designers emphasized comfort, or more precisely a mix between elegant and relaxed aesthetics, which is exactly what those who have returned to the office are looking for today. This trend is essentially translated by loose-fitting pieces and more fluid materials that offer a maximum of comfort.

"Sep 24, 2021","The season’s biggest runway debut in Milan was Raf Simons in tandem with Miuccia Prada, a show staged Friday afternoon CET time in the brand’s foundation, and simultaneously in Shanghai.
 Raf actually began his collaboration with Miuccia two years ago, and the pair have now unveiled several collections digitally. But due to Covid this was their first live catwalk show as a duo: ultimately, the true test of any designer’s mettle.
 
Little doubt about it, this was an impressive performance and organizational feat. Banks of video screens in the Deposito of the Fondazione Prada projected live images of Pudong skyscrapers before the two shows – with exactly the same series of looks – began six time zones apart.""No one had ever before tried this in history, it seemed so complicated. But I said that after this Covid experience we had to learn from it and try something different,"" explained the normally voluble Miuccia backstage, before politely pleading fears of contamination and declining to speak about her inspiration. At which point, a communications director directed editors to read a press release with quotes from the two designers. These were of such entirely anodyne and over-edited prose that it would be unfair to subject any reader to them.
 
On the actual catwalk, the show opened with some raffishly cut leather jackets – simple blazers with elevated breast-pockets, rock star bombers, posh Hells Angels biker looks, sleek spy trenches and Humphrey Bogart truck driver looks. However, for a brand whose DNA was always about arty perfection, their distressed finish reminded one of Diesel. Quite frankly, we never imagined Miuccia Prada as a fan of Bon Jovi.
 
Almost every third look came with a meter-long train, cut so small it looked like an exaggerated belt. Scores of looks featured the upside-down Prada triangle logo, while one dress – a real stunner in black – even incorporated the shape into its neckline, while its deep V gorge back showed a belt at the base of the spine. It was rather magical.
 
There was talk of the theme of trains backstage, and the sense of curvy speed was apparent in several ribbed knit tops and dresses, as well as in some sassy black leather minis topped by silk blouses, gathered like locomotive pistons. Frequently, though, the mood jarred – as with a very odd, Valentino-red, guipure sheath, cut mid-calf, that was a bit of a shambles. 
 
To sum up, a mixed bag of a collection, even with some great highlights, where the cast bravely marched around an undulating maze of runways with scores of varying step sizes. The fact no one fell, as two publishers did pre-show, was quite an accomplishment. 
Also, given the movement toward inclusivity in fashion and wider society, it did jar that the entire cast in Shanghai was Asian, while in Milan it was very much multiracial. Simons' hand was also evident in the casting – a younger, skinnier selection of models than one historically associates with Prada.
 
Throughout Milan, one finds ads in bus stops showing young women laughing uproariously with the tagline, ""Feels Like Prada."" Making the brand previously known as the natural destination of brainy, intellectual, independent women into the latest Milanese house desperate to lower the age of their target market.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 24, 2021","Friday morning in Milan was all about two labels built on Italian savoir-faire – Tod’s and Missoni, but where the former staged its best ready-to-wear collection to date; the latter utterly lost its way under a new creative director. 
 Cool and very credible at Tod’sTechnical fabrics can be tricky for most designers, though not it seems for Walter Chiapponi, who presented an cool and highly credible collection for Tod’s on a sunny Friday morning in Milan.
 
Chiapponi harnessed bubble fabrics, polyamides and advanced nylons along with the house’s classy leathers, yet somehow nothing looked artificial or stiff.The mood was spruce, the length short, the clothes both practical and polished. Like his dove-gray padded nylon dress with scalloped neckline; treated cotton matelassé parkas and sleeveless cocktails, or the great jute coat dress with diagonal pockets.
 Plus, Chiapponi refreshed the house’s whole approach to leather. From the dashing ecru leather fencing jacket with sleeves finished in Tod’s signature gommino rubber studded leather, to the sculpted black deerskin bustier cocktail with giant 'T' on the back.
 
Plenty of pizzazz too, like the brilliant beige paneled crochet dress finished with hundreds of dangling strands or the great bubble-wrap windcheaters, micro jerkins and parkas, like the one worn by Gigi Hadid as she finished the show.
 
Everything anchored by very natty techy nylon boxing boots; dense crepe-soled platforms with 'T Timeless' buckles; or dramatic new power sandals with oversized gommino studs.  
Pre-show, the managing director Carlo Alberto Berretta, appointed in February, greeted editors and stars in a great beige double-breasted suit. When a guest asked the name of his quality tailor, Berretta was able to respond, “I’m dressed head to toe in Tod’s.”
 
Staged to the soaring vocals of Rosalia, with the audience perched on white cylinder stools, the show ended with the entire cast marching out of the Padiglione D’Arte Contemporanea into a sunny garden to extended applause.
 
Tod’s has been through several designers ever since patron and principal shareholder Diego della Valle decided to hire a full time designer, from Derek Lam to Alessandra Facchinetti to an in-house team before Chiapponi was appointed two years ago. 
 
And previously Tod’s collections have been quite frankly hit or miss. However, today’s collection by Chiapponi was a definite winner. In a word, the most imaginative and easily the most coherent runway collection by Tod’s so far.
 Missoni: Lots of mass and not much class 
A significant change of gears at Missoni but not really in the right direction.
 
What was once an earthy family-owned craft-driven knitwear label was made to look like a pushy high street label in the first show since Angela Missoni relinquished design control.After the founding family sold a blocking minority stake in the house to investment group FSI, the new owners didn’t take long to wield their axes. First Angela’s daughter Margherita departed, and then Alberto Caliri was installed as designer. Nonetheless, Angela and her mum Rosita, who founded the house back in 1953, sat in the front row.
 
This was Caliri’s first runway show, with the evident brief of injecting more sex appeal into the brand. The result however felt very, very forced.
 
From the simply diagonal chenille cocktails with unravelling hem to the micro crochet bikinis, it was all a tad vulgar. When Caliri decided to color co-ordinate, the result was silvery blue gown with a far too revealing cut all the way down the back, the better to reveal matching knickers.
 
As for the brash brown and black Missoni logo looks – in particular a belt-like bra that the model clearly hated wearing – well, the less said the better.
 
The omens seemed inauspicious before the show began in a huge dank disused factory in the northern outskirts of Milan. This morning show began an hour late, during which time guests were forced to sit through a soundtrack that sounded like a biblical flood. The audience were so keen to leave, scores had already departed even before the models had exited the factory.
 
Poor manners, given the traditionally observed rule that no one departs before the designer takes his bow. But sadly understandable given this collection.

"Sep 24, 2021","The key fashion moment of Milan Fashion Week so far was the 40th anniversary Emporio Armani show on Thursday, a rich and varied collection that was followed by a brand retrospective opening in Armani Silos.
 Emporio ArmaniEmporio Armani celebrated his 40th anniversary on Thursday, with a spring 2022 show bristling with ideas and a retrospective in the designer’s personal art gallery, in the key fashion moment of Milan Fashion Week so far.The show contained multiple references to the Emporio codes – from the non-colors to deconstructed tailoring – yet there was plenty new in terms of the succinct and sophisticated draping and a fresh, soft neon-colored palette.
 
In a generous gesture, Armani took his bow with his key designers in Emporio, his niece Silvana – who shares Giorgio’s razor sharp jawline and piercing eyes – and his right-hand man Leo Dell’Orco.A huge wave of applause washing over the Tadao Ando-designed auditorium, even if strict social distancing meant there was barely one-third the normal audience of 700.
 
“To be honest, when I saw these young models looking all so well as they were about to enter the catwalk it did make me feel proud,” Armani told a dozen Italian TV reporters, who crowded around him after the first of two shows.
 
He opened with jaunty saddle-stitched suits and windowpane fine wool jackets for women and haute hobo patch-work jackets for men. His jackets were snug and concise in dimpled linen and his fatigue pants were languid and nipped at the ankle. 
 
The genius of Emporio is that this brand invented a method for a younger generation to acquire and appreciate designer fashion and democratic prices. And this collection was no exception.
 
Armani cut flawless chiffon cocktails in his non-colors of cement and lichen; and dazzled with rouched and rolled shantung Grecian goddess dresses in violet and turquoise cut well up the thigh. Breaking new ground, he sent out beautiful silk prints of ancient maps, Asian petals and tattoos. Looking back, he recalled how he came up with the Emporio logo, after his founding partner, the late Sergio Galeotti, called and asked him to come up with a “Lacoste,” referring to the French brand’s crocodile logo. Armani’s response was devised with the famed Emporio eagle, “because they soar high in the sky with no boundaries.” 
 
Post-show, the designer inaugurated a slickly prepared retrospective of his Emporio baby, called 'The Way We Are', with scores of looks culled from all four decades staged inside Armani Silos, his own personal museum.
 
Campaigns by such photo greats as Nan Goldin, Michel Comte, Aldo Fallai, Gilbert & George, Steven Klein, David LaChapelle, Peter Lindbergh, Roxanne Lowit, Steven Meisel and Max Vadukul crowded the walls.
 
Banks of images recalled all Emporio’s famed sporting model ambassadors – David Beckham, Cristiano Roland and Rafael Nadal. Speaking of which, the giant Emporio Armani sign that greets all travelers when they land in Milan airport Linate, still remains today the single most defining advertisement of Italian fashion anywhere.
 
Not bad going to a young man who quit medical school and toiled as a window-dresser before going on to create the most famous Italian brand of the past half century.
 Etro: First at bat with new bossAlways a good idea to put in a great day’s work when there is a new boss in town. Which was very much the case on Thursday with Veronica Etro, with a bold strong statement in her first runway show since private equity fund L Catterton bought control of the brand.
 
Presented inside a cavernous hanger in south Milan, the collection featured all the classic Etro signature – bold paisleys; marbled fabrics; and kicky weekend tailoring. 
Though this season, Veronica added in a hip-hop twist with humungous prisoner pants, bling-bling metallic tanks and paisley golf hats. For red carpet rapper moments – huge denim pants embroidered in sparking paisley patterns. 
 
A primary-color Etro, best exemplified by the mustard yellow paisley stamped leather shirt jacket worn over matching hot-pants, athletic bra and collapsible bag. Co-ordinated – with matching marbled silk picnic dresses and leggings. Though with plenty of tailoring: classic white tuxedos or ecru Nehru jackets.Like everyone in Milan she is obsessed with platforms; hers are held on with golden studded straps. Plus, Veronica showed some of the look of the moment; the saucy crocheted Himalayan bra. All worn with dangling earrings or forearm bands, on models whose faces were sprinkled with micro pearls.
 
However, quite why she decided to climax the show with an ear-splitting display by a dozen drummer furiously battering oil drums was hard to fathom.  This merely drummed everyone out of the show immediately.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 23, 2021","Boss went all-american at Milan Fashion Week on Thursday. For its return to the Italian city, the main line by German fashion group Hugo Boss brought in the big guns and shook up the fashion week with a fabulous show-performance, something for which it clearly has a knack. Boss set up a bona fide baseball pitch on the outskirts of Milan, the ideal environment in which to unveil its second collaboration with long-established US sportswear brand Russell Athletic, following the success of the basketball-inspired collection dropped for the Spring/Summer 2021. 
This time, Boss has chosen to dip into the world of baseball, drawing for next winter from both brands’ archives and from a 1990s aesthetic full of American retro references. Part of the collection, consisting of both menswear and womenswear, was presented in ‘see now, buy now’ mode: the Boss x Russell Athletic collection is in fact available in-store and online from Thursday September 23.
 
As they enter the sun-drenched arena, the show’s guests are welcomed by an MC shrieking in his microphone with a strong American accent. At one end of the arena, a giant screen is broadcasting images of the athletes disporting themselves on the pitch, hopping to a thundering disco soundtrack. A handful of mascots (in tankard and human-sized baseball outfits) prance around for the photographers, while boys and girls in red-striped blouses and white shorts, toques on their heads, walk around the bleachers selling hot dogs, hamburgers, popcorn and sodas. It is all very American Graffiti.A roar erupts from the stands, where over-excited fans wave giant flags, hopping and skipping as the band makes its round, the musicians in dress uniform, their hats topped with huge red plumes. Suddenly, a group of cheerleaders steps on to the turf, wearing short pleated skirts and orange tops, and together with a troupe of hip-hop dancers they start performing a frenzied routine. “Twenty-one girls and seven boys,” the MC shouts with relish.
 
The scene is set, and the parade can begin. Encouraged by the fans’ clapping, the models are all smiles as they walk through the centre of the arena in the midst of the dancers and musicians, wearing sporty varsity-style outfits featuring sneakers and hi-top lace-up canvas shoes with white socks, complete with baseball caps, bob hats and woollen beanies. 
Tracksuits, hoodies, sweaters, baseball-style t-shirts and joggers predominate, decorated with the Boss and Russell Athletic logos in vintage-style lettering. Between patches, embroidered crests and prints, each and every item sports the two brands’ logos. V-necked sweaters with striped cuffs, cardigans embellished with patches, crop tops, leggings and varsity jackets complete the Boss x Russell Athletic wardrobe, with an abundance of fleeced cotton.
 
The collection’s sportswear register is subtly combined with more austere, classic items in Boss’s signature basic monochrome palette (cream, beige, mineral blue), interspersed with bursts of bright orange. In this smarter section of the wardrobe, the touch of Ingo Wilts, Boss’s head of design, is evident in the elegant shorts, fluffy overshirts in bouclé wool, suits, maxi jackets, overcoats and outfits in micro-check fabric. An ensemble of minimalistic, cleverly-cut looks, with garments made in fine materials, resulting in a Boss collection that is elegant, very much refreshed and laid-back.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 23, 2021","Chinese fashion e-tailer Shein is the latest success story in fast fashion, a hit especially with Generation Z consumers thanks to its low prices and constant stream of new products. Shein, often under scrutiny for the lack of transparency about its supply chain, has decided to open a temporary physical store in Paris during the forthcoming fashion week.The Shein Studio store will be open between September 29 and October 2 at 13 rue Jean Beaussire, between place des Vosges and the Bastille. It will feature the latest fall/winter novelties in ready-to-wear, accessories, lingerie and beauty products, as well as the Curve collection (with sizes ranging from XL to 4XL), Shein's premium line Motf, and collaborations with influencer Stephanie Durant and French R&B singer Wejdene. “Many surprises by [Shein’s] brand ambassadors” are also on the cards.

Before Paris, Shein will make an appearance in New York on September 26, where it will stage the ‘Rock the Runway’ show, featuring live music, dancing and fashion collections. A year ago, Shein staged a first digital show that was broadcast worldwide, and in 2019 it opened pop-up stores in Paris and Marseilles.The e-tailer is especially keen to highlight the design content of its range, and this year it has launched Shein X, a programme to support emerging designers. A few days ago, Shein recognised Canadian label Flaws of Couture as the programme’s winner, awarding it a $100,000 purse to bolster its expansion plans.

According to Forbes, Shein’s annual sales are worth $10 billion, and the e-tailer, first set up in 2008, is gradually eroding the market share of traditional fashion retailers. For example, between March and May 2021, a period again marked by a spate of retail closures, Shein overtook Kiabi to become the leading player on the women’s ready-to-wear market in France (according to data by Kantar), its market share rising from 0.3% two years ago to 3.1%.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 22, 2021","Once, certain fashion designers created to empower women. Others to exalt them or make them beautiful. Today, many creators seem to have a new target in mind – pleasing the personal shopper.
 
For in today’s land of uber-luxury, if a designer can develop oodles of product that the personal shopper can sell to her very well-heeled clients, then all will be well.Fendi: Antonio Lopez revival 
Which seemed the story behind the latest collection from the house of Fendi, so crammed was it with items that simply reeked of 'rich.' 
Not that this wasn’t a powerful display both of the atelier and by Jones, in what was his first true runway show before a live audience since being named creative director a year ago. 
 
In a much-remarked gesture, Kim’s invitation was a plissé fan, the ever-present signature of his successor at Fendi, Karl Lagerfeld. And the fan’s chic sketch came from a famed former collaborator with Karl, the late great illustrator Antonio Lopez. Ideas from the archive that also in diaphanous Grecian goddess gowns and flowing tunics and blouses.Oddly for a house based in Rome, it had large quantities of classic Italian sportswear – the sort Milanese brands used to show in the Fiera. Especially its opening – long, pristine white cashmere coats; jaunty flared pants and power-shoulder suits. 
However, the key to any successful luxe label is the range of accessories, and here Jones hit multiple home-runs – from the deep totes in assemblages of shearling and leather, based on Lopez prints, or a brilliant looped under-arm sack in silver and gold, to the great wedges back with hidden architectural heel or eye-catching thigh boots.
 
The cast marching under a series of reflective arches that referenced the architecture of Fendi’s 1930s Rationalist building in Rome.
 
For a scorching summer evening, perfectly cut micro plissé skirts with matching bras or micro stretch cocktails. If it’s a chilly spring evening – gutsy aviator shearling jackets cut well above the hip; or clouds of marabou coats in a muddy abstract colors. For a grand gala, opulent lace cocktails or see-through femme fatale silk blouses, tops and tights in a kiss pattern.
 
Pre-show, Fendi’s CEO Serge Brunschwig greeted friends and honchos in the most ebullient of moods. 
“Business is incredibly good. We are reaching a whole group of customers. You might lose the odd one, but they are replaced by even more new ones,” Brunschwig beamed.
 
At the finale, Kim took his bows with Silvia Fendi and Delfina Delettrez, grand-daughter and great grand-daughter of the founders of the house, which is now owned by LVMH and Europe’s richest billionaire Bernard Arnault.
 
In a word, mighty amounts of very marketable merchandise. Everything to make the most demanding personal shopper excited. But as a vision of the future and a fashion statement, it was perhaps rather slight.

 Del Core: The vision thing 
If one is looking for vision there was gazillions of at Del Core, the new heart throb of insider Milan.
 
Last season, Daniel Del Core pulled off an major coup de theatre by staging the only runway show in Milan Fashion Week, albeit restricted to just 40 people.
 
This season he had 300 souls all socially distanced sat inside the giant former skating rink of the Palazzo Del Ghiaccio, with Anna Wintour and a slew of other top editors present.
 
The Germano-Italian Del Core certainly doesn’t lack for imagination, evidenced in this dramatic display of Italian couture, with elements of biomorphism; grand guignol and tropical fauna.
 
“I was inspired by a visit to Costa Rica where I stopped by a lake, and felt transported by clouds and nature and the forest. That’s where I began this collection,” explained Daniel in a pre-show chat. 
Hence, out marched the cast though some cumulus clouds of red and blue dry ice, in fantastically rippling silk gowns, ruffled endlessly and cut open at the back, practically to the coccyx bone.
 
Del Core is a highly accomplished draper who is at his best when he is his most flamboyant – like a really beautiful semi-sheer chiffon gown with movie-star sweep and remarkable yellow collars and lapel that floated into the air. Or a cutaway dress embroidered with puckered prairie flowers and dusted with crystals; or a Southern Belle fantasy gown in a rose and leaf print, with ruffles so grand they doubled the size of the dress.
 
All worn on a fresh cast with jelled-back hair, often topped by giant plissé tropical leaf shaped hats that tower several feet over the head.  
The show was about five looks too long, and Del Core clearly lacks a self-editing button, yet this felt like an Alta Moda celebration.
 
No sign of any personal shopper here, since Del Core’s gal is the VIP determined to make a red carpet splash. He previously handled VIP clients for Alessandro Michele’s Gucci. But no shortage of vision either.

"Sep 21, 2021","No show from Victoria Beckham, but at least a collection presented in digital form - in a lookbook embargoed until noon on Tuesday, the last day of London Fashion Week. Beckham’s theme was one of escapism, ideally for a continental jaunt equipped with lots of masculine tailoring and evocative long dresses.
 
“When thinking about this season I was drawn to the elegance of a European summer; linen suits, slip dresses and sunsets. The way a trip like that can make you feel almost detached from reality, like it’s another era. It’s quite romantic,” explained Victoria in her program notes.Her ideal man to accompany down to the Cote d’Azur or Mykonos was not, however, just her husband David, but “Leo in linen, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas – the string vest and unbuttoned shirt – then of course Mr. Beckham himself.” 
 “A masculine silhouette is part of our DNA,” insisted the designer, who showed windowpane-check tunic suits; single-pleated linen pants or crisply tailored single-breasted suits. 
 
For moments when the ladies just want to chill – broad-striped pajama looks; snug ribbed tops and snazzy metallic skirts.  For evening – ankle-length silk slip dresses overprinted with images of the actual look or fluid columns in a color palette of mint, buttercup and flesh.
 
Victoria worked with her preferred team – Jane How styling, and the casting agent of the moment, Piergiorgio Del Moro - and the result was a concise statement, even if nothing ever replaces a real show. 
While the lookbook featured makeup from Victoria Beckham Beauty and skincare from Victoria Beckham Beauty by Augustinus Bader, a rapidly growing division for the UK designer which well-informed observers expect will guarantee the house profitability in future years.
 
“I liked the idea of a couple sharing their holiday wardrobe. Your partner’s shirt thrown over your swimsuit or slip dress, a jacket tucked into tailored trousers. Swapping your everyday jewelry for a single heavy piece, something a little masculine,” concluded Beckham.

"Sep 21, 2021","London Fashion Week’s final day of major shows on Monday was the latest tour around the capital, from outdoor Hyde Park art centre to East End church with stops in Mayfair, including a gentleman’s club to a trendy concept restaurant.

We caught up with four actual catwalk shows - Simone Rocha; Roksanda; Paul & Joe and Osman 
 Simone Rocha:  Experimental romanticism 
A tour de force display by Simone Rocha in a medieval church and the defining collection in the first proper post-lockdown season in London Fashion Week.Simone fusing all her signature sleights of hand and technical flourishes into a beautiful display of experimental and voluminous romanticism.
 
Dresses almost grew out of jackets and trench-coats as Rocha added a fresh organically deconstructed element to her DNA. Most dramatically with dimpled satin dresses that emerged out of serge mannish coats.Staged in St Bartholomew’s church, the scene of the final nuptials in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', and an apt setting for the frequently religious references in the collection – ginormous reverend mother’s collars with scallop trim, or a nun’s habit morphed into something rather wonderfully new.
 
Rocha’s fondness for interlaced strips of satin, oversized pearls and embroidered coral seen in dramatic gothic dresses of voluminous quantities of tulle and chiffon.
 
“Sleep walking, mothering. Communion dress, embellished, distressed,” read the program notes from the young mum, Rocha, who decided to close her backstage, respecting sanitary measures. 
 
After 18 months where everyone was forced to slow down and examine who they were and where they wanted to go, it was striking to witness Simone’s poetic proposition of life lived gracefully in broderie anglaise, bedding brocade and distressed leather.
 
The designer was also courageous enough to take plenty of risks – sending out an elephantine perfecto over a cotton poplin shirt with puritan collar and flared short dress trimmed in broderie anglaise. The same trim used on ankle socks tucked into mammoth modernist platforms, which, in turn, had embroidered patterns. Indeed, almost alone among indie London designers Rocha has built a great footwear business, and her array of embroidered ballet slippers finished with pearls will ensure that division is bound to accelerate.
 
All this together winning the designer a huge burst of applause at the finale; from an audience all of whom wore masks. Unlike, unfortunately, the majority of shows in London this season.
 Roksanda: Performance art and Joan Didion quotesRoksanda: Gravity defying fashion in Hyde Park, and balletic fashion from this season Roksanda, who returned to a favorite old haunt, the Serpentine Pavilion, to present her Spring/Summer 2022 collection. 
All unveiled within this year’s architectural installation from Johannesburg-based practice Counterspace. Its director, Sumayya Vally, is the youngest architect to be commissioned by this annual program and the result was a light gray and ecru assemblage referencing current and demolished buildings in London – including elements of mosques, bookshops and dance clubs.
 
Though the end result was like the clothes – a series of abstractions melded, spliced and superimposed in swirling statement costumes. Gravity defying shapes made by bonding fabrics and stiffening hems and rims so dresses curved and arched upwards and collars extended out of shoulders.
 
Many of them worn by the dance troop in a work of performance art by her old buddy Holly Blakely. The very dance movements helping the clothes come alive – as a dozen models and as many performers rambled around the space, occasionally nudging aside a guest the better to pirouette.
 
Even if her most beautiful looks were slouchy raincoats in transparent material over-painted with wild daubs and even quotes from Joan Didion’s book of essays 'Slouching Towards Bethlehem'. 
 Paul & Joe: La Mode Parisienne in MayfairA triumphant entry into London Fashion Week by Paul & Joe, whose energetic designer Sophie Mechaly has always been a bona-Anglophile.Presented amid Royal portraits and oils of upstanding gents inside Dartmouth House. Somewhat eccentrically for the setting of show by a French brand, Dartmouth House is a club of the English-Speaking Union in Mayfair.
 
A gaggle of local 'it' gals and guys – Lady Mary Charteris, Greta Bellamacina, Betty Bachz, Grace Chatto, Sam Rollinson, Dylan Weller, Juan Milan, Kyle De’Volle, Nell Tiger Free and Tigerlily Taylor – sat front row.
 
Mechaly referenced childlike imagery throughout – with the key item the baby-doll dress in prairie or alpine flowers. Every second model marching in knee socks with matching florals or Pinball Wizard platforms. Her carefree casting marching inside the cut-stone interior garden in flouncy pink frocks with cut-off bouffant sleeve or cool floral lattice stripe blazers.
 
At times it was Miss Havisham-meets-Tess of the d’Urbervilles with grand dresses in faded dried flower prints. Before the designer suddenly shifted gears with crochet lederhosen, cardigans and hot pants; or saucy bloomers and matching bras in crinkly little florals.
 
Backed up by a great soundtrack of French rock and pop hits, including France Gall and Jane Birkin, and also given a great twist by Japanese cosplay, one-eyed makeup.
 
“I was brought up to be a great admirer of London so to show here finally is a great personal joy. My father used to take us to shop annually as little kids in Harrods, so when I was a young gal my aesthetic was quite London professional family,” smiled Mechaly backstage, as a swarm of fans gathered around. 
 
Osman: Biodegradable chic in wood pulp
 
Osman Yousefzada pulls no punches when it comes to the environment, basing his latest collection on Tencel, a filament formed from wood pulp that lead to a striking collection of proportions and punch.Produced by the Lenzing Group, Tencel proved to be surprisingly supple, seen in paper-light silk jerseys or hand-woven organzas.
 
Osman entitled the collection, 'What happened to last season’s clothes', in a post-Covid reflection on over excess.
 
The result was diaphanous midnight blue cloaks; Tencel serge tunics with crystal bands; 'Game of Thrones' blousons worn with bicycle shorts and lace pants, paired with semi-sheer scarf shirts held together with a chunky medallion.
 
His most divine moment, a meeting of a lace bod-suit with an Emirates flight attendant. Worn on a cast that at on time would have been called crossdressers, but nowadays are referred to as non-binary.
 
All rather spicy, just like the cocktail served at the location, a giant swish restaurant called Amazonica on Berkeley Square. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 21, 2021","Fashion is back where it belongs in Milan, after two seasons in digital mode. As the city centre is
again brimming with tourists, and its usual, ceaseless traffic, on September 21-27 Milan is set to
host a fashion week that makes an unambiguous return to physical events, unveiling the women's
ready-to-wear collections for Spring/Summer 2022. The programme is extremely intense, with
a schedule of no fewer than 173 events, including a small number of digital presentations.More than ever, this season's fashion week will be spread throughout the city, from its historic centre all the way out to the suburbs. Covid-19-related restrictions have driven houses to organise their shows in new, more spacious venues on the outskirts of the Lombard capital, many of which have not previously been explored by brands. On offer: 63 runway shows – 42 of which are physical, 75 presentations, and 33 events, including special projects, anniversaries, store openings, parties and other happenings. 
 
Suffice to say, the fashionistas will be racking up the kilometres in Milan this season. Jil Sander, which was purchased by OTB earlier this year, and which will be making its return to the Milanese runway on Wednesday, September 22, following a stint showing in Paris, is taking over an ""exclusive location"" in the heart of a new neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Milan. Etro, on the other hand, is moving south, where it will show in a converted industrial space. Missoni has opted for a similar venue, but up in the north of the city, in the Bovisa neighbourhood. Down in the south of the city again, Sunnei is promising ""an extreme experience."" MSGM has chosen the new park next to Garibaldi station, while Francesca Libertore has rented a historic Milanese cinema. Milan Fashion Week kicks off on Tuesday, September 21, with a slew of events, including two conferences dedicated to sustainable fashion, the inauguration of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana's  Fashion Hub, which will house the collections of young Italian designers, and the party organised by Benetton to present the collection made in collaboration with its new ambassador, Tunisian-Italian rapper Ghali.
 
On the following day, Wednesday, September 22, the marathon of runways hits its stride, with the collective, digital show, ""Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion,"" which brings together five design talents from minority communities. Up next is Fendi, followed by N°21, Jil Sander and Roberto Cavalli, which is making its big comeback to the Milanese catwalk under the creative direction of Fausto Puglisi, having last shown in the city in February 2019. The other major Italian brands will participate in the week with either physical shows – as is the case with Max Mara, Armani, Prada, Tod's, Marni, and Dolce & Gabbana – or videos broadcast via the CNMI's website, which is the format chosen by Dsquared2, Antonio Marras, GCDS, Emilio Pucci, and Philipp Plein, among others. 
 Other important comebacks on the calendar, beyond Cavalli and Jil Sander, include the return of Moncler, on September 25, when the brand will transform its Genius project into ""Mondogenius"" with a hybrid live and digital event presented by singer Alicia Keys from Milan, but also linked up with Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul and New York. The last time that the brand presented the collections from its collective of designers in Milan was in February 2020. Prada is also promising a unique experience with a double runway show, set to be held simultaneously in Milan and Shanghai. Versace, which showed off-calendar via a video in March, is also returning to the Milanese programme with a physical show scheduled for the evening of September 24. 

It's the same story for Boss, which took a break from fashion week in February, as well as for Shi.rt, the new label from Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, and talented South African designer Sindiso Khumalo, a finalist of the 2020 LVMH Prize. Both brands skipped this year's winter session after making their respective debuts in Milan in September 2020. 
 
The week is further enriched by some interesting new names, including a trio of young African designers. Joy Ijeoma Meribe, a Nigerian designer now living in Parma, Italy, where she founded her brand, Joy Meribe, in 2017, will make her runway debut on September 22. Maison Alvine Demanou, which is led by its eponymous Cameroonian-born, Venice-based designer, will present its collection on Monday, September 27. Finally, Lagos Space Programme will show on the same day, having made its Milan debut, albeit in digital format, during January's menswear calendar, before shifting onto the womenswear schedule. 

In addition to these new names, there's also Italian label Vitelli, founded by Mauro Simionato in 2016, which, inspired by subcultures and supported by Giulia Bortoli, reimagines all-Italian knitwear with a contemporary twist, as well as Hui, the brand founded by China's Zhao Huizhou. Having already shown several times in Milan, the designer, who fights to protect Chinese heritage and ancestral craftsmanship through her Hui foundation, is debuting on the official calendar. Here she will also be joined by historic Italian fashion house Luisa Spagnoli, which organised a first grand show-event in Milan in September 2018, in celebration of its 90th anniversary. 
 Notable absences include Moschino, which showed in New York on September 9; Valentino, which has returned to the Parisian calendar; and Gucci, which has chosen to present its collection in Los Angeles in November. The Italian brand has, however, promised a special event at Milan's Arco della Pace on September 25, explaining that it will focus on the mysterious theme, ""Vault."" The label has even created a dedicated site for this top secret project, which has been generating buzz since this summer. 
 
Some fifteen brands have also disappeared from the rich programme of digital shows that graced February's calendar, including promising young talents that many would have liked to see more from this season, such as Alessandro Vigilante, Christian Boaro and his label CHB, and Giuseppe Buccinnà. Some will nonetheless be present via presentations. Also worthy of note is the arrival on the official calendar of no fewer than 12 new names: Cormio, Quira, Andreadamo, Defaince by Nicola Bacchilega, Roberto Di Stefano, Aniye By, Iuri, Traffico, Radica Studio, Airin Tribal and ATXV.

Elsewhere, the calendar will be complemented by a number of parallel events bringing the usual effervescence of Milan Fashion Week to the city centre, including runway shows from the likes of Maryling, John Richmond, Mario Dice and Ramzen; performances from artists like Bikkembergs, who will be playing alongside street performers; the launch of the Bruno Cucinelli eyewear line; and store openings, including the much-anticipated inauguration of the new Ferrari location. 

All this without counting the parties and dinners organised by certain houses, or the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of Pomellato's Nudo collection, the 40th anniversary of Emporio Armani, the 60th anniversary of eyewear brand Marcolin and the 50th anniversary of Chiara Boni's career, as well as the numerous projects organised by the CNMI promoting sustainability or young design talent.

"Sep 20, 2021","The weekend’s key show in London Fashion Week was by Erdem, where designer Erdem Moralioglu was inspired by his new neighborhood Bloomsbury and two of its legendary eccentrics, Dame Edith Sitwell and Lady Ottoline Morrell.
 Erdem: Brilliant in Bloomsbury Presented majestically under the lofty colonnade of the British Museum, the show was a moment of grace amid an afternoon of intense English showers. Adding to the sense of honest beauty, a double rainbow appeared over the courtyard just as the cast staged the finale.
 
“I moved to Bloomsbury during the pandemic and started to think about the characters who inhabited the area. Sitwell and Morrell were two amazing and formidable women; independent of thought and how they approached life. Two extraordinary beauties who lived peripherally,” explained the designer in a post-show gathering. Both women were six feet tall, and knew and entertained each other, and both had donated gifts to the British Museum – hence the location. But the never-ending source of inspiration for Erdem is of course his adopted city and its inventive citizens and denizens. One pre-Covid show was a Cecil Beaton collection in the National Portrait Gallery.  
Sunday’s show opened with a recording of Sitwell reciting a poem from the collection 'Gardeners and Astronomers,' introducing a sensational collection. In particular, the pristine mannish tuxedo shirts worn over silver embroidered simple linen skirts; perforated white poplin dresses; cashmere mohair tanks; or A-line trench coats with an Edwardian silhouette.
 
“I thought there was something so beautiful and poetic about the idea of astronomy and gardening. Building something on earth while looking at the stars,” smiled Erdem, standing in his backstage – in this case before a series of massive Assyrian winged man-bulls.
 
Though the most beautiful images were the flared dresses topped by chiffon saucer hats; made either in black or hyper-sized chintz florals.
 
“I loved the the ghosts of Bloomsbury trotting around the museum in brogues. Plus, the purity of white cotton seemed to suggest a new chapter for the next 15 years,” he added.
 
The season also celebrated the Canadian-born Erdem’s 15th anniversary, so he finished with a bride, as he did in his 2006 debut; and even sewed in the number '15' in a couple of looks. Halfway through, Erdem threw in a few gentlemanly looks, from little-boy plaid colonial suits to shirts made of elegant floral pencil drawings.
 
“I did my first men’s collection during the pandemic. It will come out in November, so creating a counterpart was appropriate – he was her and she was him. The two ladies both had amazing love affairs,” he chuckled, before a giant mood board.  
Sitwell did a tour of America and “amazingly became a great friend of Marilyn Monroe,” he noted. Seen in a mood board photo alongside Pavel Tchelitchew’s famed portrait of her and other images of Edith covered in Elsa Peretti jewelry. A noted fashion icon, Dame Edith Sitwell famous dictum was: “Good taste is the worst vice ever invented.”
 
Erdem sees them as “women living outside of the time they actually lived in.” Morrell wore Edwardian clothing in the 1940s, while Sitwell dressed in medieval clothes. “Everything was displaced and disjointed in terms of time,” said Erdem, whose collection nonetheless seemed remarkably timely.
 
Above all the show was a timely reminder of why designers go to such lengths to stage shows.
 
“There is something tremendously powerful about people coming together to see a body of work. I don’t think film can ever replace that. Seeing and hearing the bustle of a dress move by cannot be replaced. It is a beautiful thing,” said the new Bloomsbury boy, who once staged a show in a nearby private garden square.
 
“There are so many strange little pockets of space I’ve broken into over the years,” he smiled, causing a ripple of laughter among a score of well wishers.
 Roland Mouret: Homer with a Kafka twist 
While designers have been shooting fashion videos incessantly for the past 18 months, Roland Mouret took the concept a step further with his very own film premiere.
 
Unveiled inside the swish private screening room of the Soho Hotel, a gang of editors, it-gals and fashionistas crowded in at noon on Sunday to witness a retelling of a key chapter of the Odyssey.
 
Except this time, Ulysses is a black refugee that three beautiful sirens rescue from drowning after he floats in on a life belt, interrupting their mid-afternoon swim. Entitled 'Terma,' the film is the latest collab by Mouret to support and empower creative women. 
 
Shot in Aegina, an island close to Athens, the movie starred Magaajyia Silberfeld, as a beautiful Hera who arrives nervously in contemporary Greece, before encountering her two other sirens – Pisinoe and Aglaope. Initially lost, she finds herself after meeting  Pisinoe, with whom she then spends the night, though it’s ambiguous whether they actually make love.
 
“Its Homer, but interpreted by Kafka,” explained Elias Borst, a Frenchman who jointly directed 'Terma' with  Silberfeld. 
 
A timely interpretation of history’s most famous novel, and a clever setting for Mouret’s latest ideas.
 
Far less formal that traditional typical Mouret collections, it featured soft-hued buttoned-up easy summer dresses; or bright halterneck sheathes seen in a seductive dance scene.  When the three siren rescue Ulysses from two local jealous bigots, they ride scooters in elasticated-waist trousers and cutely folded tops with ruffled necklines.
 
For an evening cocktail at a dilapidated old farm, taffeta, pleated silk lurex gowns and caped taffeta bodices.
 
An optimistic statement by an optimistic designer, made in the Mediterranean colors of this French creator’s youth - pale mint, pearl, faded rose and sea blue.

"Sep 20, 2021","Halima Aden, the first supermodel to wear a hijab and pose in a burkini, has ripped up her lucrative contracts in an industry she feels lacks ""basic human respect"" and entered the world of modest fashion design instead.For the Somali-American who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya, it was a matter of preserving her self-worth and well-being in a fast and loose sector that increasingly clashed with her Muslim values.

""Since I was a little girl, this quote -- 'don't change yourself, change the game' -- has gotten me through so much in life,"" she told AFP in an interview in Istanbul.""When I took the decision to quit, that is exactly what I did,"" she said. ""So I am very, very proud.""

Aden's departure last November delivered a shock to fashionistas and Muslim influencers who have admired her trailblazing career.

Aden, who turns 24 on Sunday, broke ground in Minnesota, where she became the first contestant to wear a hijab and a burkini -- a full-body swimsuit whose appearance has stirred controversy on some European beaches -- in a US state beauty pageant in 2016.

She posed in them again for Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit issue when her fame was spreading in 2019.

But personally, Aden felt increasingly boxed in -- sometimes literally.

""I was always given a box, a private place to change in, but many times I was the only one given the privacy,"" she said.

""I got to see my fellow young women having to undress and change in public, in front of media personalities, cooks and staff, designers and assistants,"" she recalled.

""To me, it was very jarring,"" she said. ""I couldn't be in an industry where there is no basic human respect.""

'Poison!'Aden sounded liberated when she announced her decision to abandon photo shoots and catwalks last year. She is becoming a designer instead.

""Wow this is actually the most RELIEF I felt since I started in 2016. Keeping that in was literal POISON!"" she said on Instagram.

She felt her traditions, starkly different from those of most other supermodels, were caricatured and turned into a gimmick by some brands.

One, American Eagle, replaced a headscarf with a pair of jeans on her head in a 2017 campaign.

""But... this isn't even my style??"" she protested on Instagram at the time.

""I got to a place where I couldn't recognise my hijab the way I would traditionally wear it,"" Aden told AFP.

Aden looked far more at ease in Istanbul, surrounded by Middle Eastern fashionistas while attending an event organised by Modanisa, her new home.

She will be designing collections exclusively for the Turkish online brand, which is one of the biggest names in the modest fashion industry, valued at $277 billion in 2019.

It already makes up more than a tenth of the $2.2 trillion global fashion industry, with plenty of room to grow, according to DinarStandard, an advisory firm specialising in emerging Muslim markets.'Taste of the world'World capitals as diverse as Moscow, Riyadh and London have staged modest fashion shows in the past few years.

The trend is particularly strong in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, where Aden rejoices at the melee of cultures on the streets.

""What I love the most about Turkey, especially Istanbul, is that it is very diverse, you see women who don't wear the hijab right alongside women who wear the hijab,"" she said.

""You get a taste of the world in Istanbul.""

The industry has taken off in the past decade, thanks in part to the modelling careers of women such as Aden.

Soft-spoken but smiley, Aden sounds confident in modest fashion's ability to withstand crises like the coronavirus pandemic and changing fads.

""It is the oldest fashion staple, it's been around for hundreds of years, it will continue to be around for hundreds of years,"" she said.

Islam and fashion ""are 100 percent compatible because there's nothing in our religion that says you can't be fashionable,"" she said.

Luxury brands such as DKNY and Dolce & Gabbana have already picked up on the trend, creating collections catered to modest women.

But Aden hit out at ""a lot of tokenism, especially in the fashion industry, where they want our money but they don't want to support us in the issues that we are faced with.""

""I think fashion needs to do a greater job,"" she said. ""You are representing your clients who are Muslims, it is important to speak up when they are faced with injustices.""

"Sep 19, 2021","Not that many shows, but plenty of ideas this weekend at London Fashion Week, with the highlight on Saturday an explosive show by Labrum London.
 Labrum London: Dashing diaspora

Just when you thought you were going in to see the next little thing, along comes Labrum London with a sensational show blending Agbada attitude and West African chic, British tailoring and bold African silhouettes.Inclusivity is the single most important issue in fashion today, and the show that Labrum London staged on Saturday was its best expression so far in London Fashion Week. 
 
Labrum London’s founder is designer Foday Dumbuya, who also recently created the Olympic uniforms for the Sierra Leone team, which were designed for more than 16 disciplines. Dumbuya’s goal: a blend of West African panache and UK heritage with oodles of assertiveness, explained by its name – Labrum means edge in Latin. The brand’s tagline is ""Designed by an immigrant.""
 
There was an intense sense of expectancy inside the Old Selfridges Hotel for this show, kicked off by a tremendous performance by Balimaya Project, a 13-piece band that blends Fela Kuti funk and jazz. Driven by fantastic percussionists and braying brass, the live music was the perfect soundtrack to the collection.
 
Turns out Dumbuya is a snazzy tailor, who cut dashing drop-shoulder suits in bold stripes, paired with high-collar shirts with tulip sleeves. His most impressive idea was working with intricate hand-drawn prints depicting Sierra Leonean village life, courtesy of The Sound of Movement – seen in power blue suits or grand sleeveless gowns in a coed show.
 
Other cool elements included tie-dye dusters and blazers worn with shorts and some fantastic headgear, including towering turbans made in rich fabrics. A counterpoint to the set that included 70s graphic screens and even a series of ottomans made by artist Yinka Ilori. 
Molly Goddard: Soutanes in an umbrella factory

No show this season from the hottest designer in London this past half-decade, but a small presentation and a video, at least. Molly is still technically on maternity leave.
 
No major new direction either, but lots of the elaborate volumes that are the leitmotif of Goddard: smock dresses in candy floss pink or daisy yellow, puckered chiffon blouses or layered tulle cocktails worn over wide-legged jeans, chalk-stripe pants or track-pants in this coed show.
 
The Goddard guys in the video even wore oversized soutanes. Naughty altar boys in a shoot staged inside a former umbrella factory that was once Wolfgang Tillmans' studio.
 
Cool and clever, though not particularly adventurous. 
 KNWLS: Bodice-ripper in Cavendish Square

It’s remarkable how many fashion designers love a carpark, and the dingier the better. From Sydney to Soho, La République to the Lower East Side, the cinematic properties of carparks, columns and reflective lighting exert a powerful attraction.
 
Case in point: KNWLS, which staged their show three floors down in a carpark beneath Cavendish Square. Entitled ""Adrenalin,"" the collection was ideal for self-assertive femmes fatales. Heartbreaker gals who stride and strut everywhere, attired in abstract floral bodices held together with string, the better to reveal plenty of flesh; rusticated leather hipster pants; saucy corsets; bias-cut, frilly prairie flower frocks finished at the hip; or worn, barely-there, low-cut leather cocktails over chiffon leggings. Their single best idea was the combo of bicycle shorts, bodice and blown-up leather blouson, where the elasticated knit trim covered the whole back.
 
Their gals also marched in serpent leather cowboy ankle boots, while huge faux pearl earrings dangled from their ears. These are looks that stand out 100 yards away, another reason this collection worked inside the carpark, finishing with the whole cast eventually disappearing into darkness.
 
Launched in 2021, KNWLS is the brainchild of Charlotte Knowles and her partner Alexandre Arsenault.  
 
One needs a certain amount of gall and chutzpah, not to mention a great figure, to wear KNWLS, but if one has those qualities this is a great collection. Which worked because Knowles and Arsenault boast real design chops and clearly believe in what they do. If you are looking for authenticity in London, then no brand is more authentic than KNWLS.

Edeline Lee: Harley Street for a consultation

After 18 months feeling very locked-in, a little Surrealism seemed to be in order. At least according to 
Edeline Lee, a Canadian-born designer who has made London her home.
 
Lee is famous for her slightly crazy shows, but this season she unveiled a plush video of models captured in extended dreamlike landscapes, all the better to highlight her subtle sense of on-the-move style.
 
""I began wanting a Dali landscape background and we took it from there,"" explained Lee, who, due to Covid, never met FrankNitty3000, the clever chap who did the great slice-and-dice post-production effects.
 
Lee presented her Spring/Summer 2022 collection in an elegant Harley Street pied-à-terre. Though she produces everything in London, Lee sources her lush fabrics – bubble jacquards, crinkly georgettes and perfect sturdy cotton poplins – from Milano Unica, her favorite fabric fair.

"Sep 17, 2021","Diesel is pushing forward with its creative repositioning as an avant-garde denim brand and is turning all spotlights on its new creative director, Glenn Martens. Having taken over design at the brand a year ago, the inventive Y/Project creative director unveiled his first collection for the Italian jeans maker via a video in June. Now, in a one-off pre-launch, a selection of pieces from this Spring/Summer 2022 collection have been made available for purchase at a small selection of stores, as well as on the Diesel e-commerce website.  
Dubbed ""Avant-Première,"" this special launch, which pre-empts the arrival of the collection in stores in early 2022, includes six key looks – three for women and three for men – as well as a selection of extra pieces, such as t-shirts and vests.The pieces are exclusively available at 32 retailers around the world. This select group includes Paris' Galeries Lafayette, which will notably host a pop-up at its Champs-Élysées store between September 20 and October 9, but will also be selling the looks at its locations in Doha, Shanghai and Beijing. Other stores offering the pieces include Tsum in Moscow, Isetan in Tokyo, Antonia and 10 Corso Como in Milan, T.A. in New York, and The Webster in Los Angeles. 
 Among the looks on offer, there's a version of the classic five-pocket jeans reimagined with built-in high-heeled boots, priced at 995 euros, a trompe-l'oeil shirt in false denim, and pieces incorporating quilted and marbled denim. A vest with an integrated belt, for example, is priced at 295 euros, while a quilted, distressed trench is on offer for 1,495 euros. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 17, 2021","There might not be that many shows in London Fashion Week this season, or that many guests, nonetheless the season opened with a bang on Friday with three diverse and memorable statements. Politically, sociologically and aesthetically Edward Crutchley, David Koma and Nensi Dojaka all produced powerful fashion expressions in shows scattered about the UK capital.
 
We caught up with all three designers with wildly different visions, and in very distant locations.
 Edward Crutchley: Rum, sodomy and Islington

Edward Crutchley kicked off the afternoon action with a considerable work of fashion historicism, inspired by 18th-century gay culture in London.Specifically, as his show notes explained, citing a report in The Weekly Journal of October 5, 1728: ""On Sunday Night last a Constable with proper Assistants, searched the House of Jonathan Muff, alias Miss Muff, in Black-Lyon Yard, near Whitechapel Church, where they apprehended nine male Ladies, including the Man of the House. They were secured that Night in New Prison, and Monday Morning they were examined before Justice Jackson, in Ayliff-street; John Bleak Cawlend was committed to Newgate, he being charged on Oath with committing the detestable Sin of Sodomy.""
 
Which led to recycled polyester and Lurex brocade used in bodices, mini skirts, and dresses with trains; Donkey jackets with monochrome logos; handmade rhinestone leotards and broccato-print silk boxer shorts.
 
""You know I like a little extravagance. If you can get 30 meters of fabric into a look I will,"" chuckled the designer after the show, staged inside Collins Music Hall, a bizarre concrete bunker in Islington. 
 
Edward glorified his riche mélange with all manner of gold-plated charms and necklaces, party-animal body chains and ocelot-print headscarves. All illuminated by lasers. It all teetered on the burlesque but never became visual bedlam. Crutchley might be an overly historical designer but he has a happy mind, whose ensembles, when they work, are often beautiful. As many of these ideas were. 
 
Asked why he focused on that trial, the designer replied:  ""I think we are in a difficult time for queer people. I genuinely believe that. I don’t the world is necessarily becoming a kinder place. And I think we have a responsibility to speak up, and show up, and show beauty. Beauty if always the most important thing for me.""
 
""That era was not necessarily darker. Because in the 1720s there were the equivalent number of queer spaces for the population. It would have been like having 200 gay bars in 1970 in London. So gay culture was really alive back then,"" cautioned Crutchley, whose recent Instagram photos show him in shorts and black T-Shirts featuring a Bollywood star, posed in a Barbican-like tower block. A far cry from his day job, as the fabric expert working alongside Kim Jones for Dior’s menswear in Paris.
 
""I think there is a general shift to the right and I think that is always dangerous. There is more pressure on gay culture than there ever has been in the last century,"" he concluded.
 David Koma: Glamazons in The Pool of Champions

These past few seasons it felt like David Koma had been treading water, after his departure from the storied house of Thierry Mugler. He’ll always have Paris, and today he certainly owned London with a great tempestuous display of sexy, synchronized swimming chic.
 
All staged with great drama inside the London Aquatics Centre, a soaring expression of organic concrete architecture where the cast marched before a half-dozen sculptural high-diving boards. Literally walking on water, since they covered the diving section of a location which also boasts a 50-meter pool – all built for the London Olympics.
 
""I first got the idea of showing here back in 2012, when they had the games in London. Plus, I am an enormous fan of Zaha Hadid. And today that all came together,"" smiled Koma, who referenced Esther Williams pin-up photos, and Busby Berkeley choreography.
 
David’s Glamazons appeared in combos of skin-tight Lycra leotards and puckered feather bubble skirts and sleeves, all trimmed in crystal. Or they showed yards of well-tanned leg beneath micro cocktails, slashed Barbie Doll dresses, or va-va-voom sequined pantsuits. All made in a high-gloss, day-glow, attention-grabbing palette. Not a hoodie or leggings in sight.
 
Add in feather boas and marabou wraps and this was  a sizzling show in a watery paradise.Nensi Dojaka: From nabbing the LVMH Prize to showing in London
 
Last week Nensi Dojaka won fashion’s best-known young talent award, the LVMH Prize. This Friday she showed in the nerve center of London Fashion Week, in the most anticipated show of the day.
 
Albanian-born Dojaka was something of a surprise winner of the Paris prize, though she would not be the first. She is clearly an accomplished lingerie designer with a unique point of view. Nensi’s slip dresses and brassieres are cut with great skill, while her sense of detailing was nigh on impeccable. She also added in some well-tailored pants, which all looked elegant.
 
However, judging by this display, her range is still rather limited. The collection also cried out for better styling, and a more suitable location. Holding a lingerie show inside the Old Selfridges Hotel, a disused concrete-floored warehouse, was completely wrong for intimate clothes. One had to wonder, had Dojaka ever heard of or seen any shows by Victoria’s Secrets, Etam or Rihanna?
 
Moreover, in an era of inclusivity there were no plus sized models or, alternatively, a Sports Illustrated amazon. And, yet another thing missing – no honcho from LVMH.
 
Sniffed one veteran in the front-row: ""If Karl had still been on the jury, would she have one first prize?""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 17, 2021","Chanel has created a Chair of Savoir-Faire at the Institut Français de la Mode (IFM), part of a five-year commitment to the leading Paris fashion college. 
The Chanel Chair is the latest example of the luxury brand’s support for IFM, the rapidly developing campus on the Seine.
 
Underlining the importance of craftsmanship in this new academic creation, the project is entitled the Chanel and le19M Chair in Fashion Savoir-Faire.19M is the giant artisanal center of excellence opened this year on the outskirts of northwest Paris, which groups the many craft houses owned by Chanel’s holding called Paraffection.
 
Chanel’s new goal is to develop a center of research and teaching excellence in savoir-faire for the college, aided by 19M. Among the houses at 19M are Lesage Intérieurs and its embroidery arts school; the Montex atelier and MTX, its decoration department; shoemaker Massaro; feather and flower expert Lemarié; milliner Maison Michel, and pleater Lognon, along with the creative department of Eres, the swimwear line of the extended Chanel group.
 
IFM is at the center of a plan being implemented by French luxury leaders in the hopes that Paris might finally create a college to rival schools in London and New York. 
 
""It’s a subject close to our hearts. To link together brands and the college to help IFM evolve. To combine together many crafts and skills is, to us, primordial,"" explained Bruno Pavlovsky, president of Chanel’s fashion activities, speaking at a press conference and debate inside the college. 
 
""Its been Chanel’s goal for quite a while. Chanel has offered internships to many students from IFM for the past several years,"" added Pavlovsky, who also happens to be the chairman of the executive committee at IFM. 
 
Asked by FashionNetwork.com about the level of financial support for the new position, Pavlovsky revealed that it would be in the order of 150,000 euros annually. IFM already had two other specific chairs – financed by fabric tradeshow Premier Vision and luxury group Kering, the latter devoted to sustainability.
 
However, the dean of IFM, Xavier Romatet, was keen to highlight that Chanel and other leading luxury marques had already made substantial financial engagements annually to IFM.
 
""In this new academic year we welcome some 1,000 students, and about 300 will be doing studies in different métiers. One third of their time is spent on studying and learning about techniques. Our brief is to prepare our students to understand the ensemble of crafts and to make them multi-disciplinary,"" Romatet noted.
 
Roughly one-third of IFM students study fashion and luxury management, but even they are given multiple opportunities to actually create real objects.
 
""That way they understand the language of creation, which is vital when they manage a fashion house,"" the dean explained. 
 
Moreover, last week, on the first day of the master's program, students spent their time looking at craftsmanship, and meeting talented artisans.
 
Romatet conceded that research and studies in fashion in Paris have lagged behind international rivals, despite the French capital being the leading fashion city in terms of runway seasons. However, he promised that IFM would rival the leading fashion colleges in the U.S., the UK, or anywhere else for that matter, within the next half-decade.
 
In a debate from the floor, Pascal Morand, executive president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, which governs all Paris catwalk seasons, opined: ""Creation and savoir-faire are the center of all we do. It’s vital for IFM and for the world of fashion. It’s paradoxical that France lags behind in fashion studies. It may be a question of structuralism. Precisely because our savoir-faire in France is so close to us we don’t appreciate it enough, and that’s why we didn’t construct a fortress to protect and develop it.""
 
A core element in this new chair is studying at 19M – a 25,000-square-meter complex that incarnates creation, boasting 600 artisans, a gallery and even a school of embroidery. Both Romatet and Pavlovsky stressed a further goal was the marriage of high-tech and low-tech; hand-made and technology, like 3D printing.
 
""19M is a magnificent space, and an absolutely incredible marriage of traditions from the 19th century with the most sophisticated technology, in terms of machinery and software,"" enthused the IFM dean.
 
Pavlovsky, the key driver behind 19M, said a key goal was preserving many unique skills, to guarantee the future of haute couture, a uniquely French tradition.
 
""We are not doing this for Chanel, but for the industry. This course is not a recruitment project or drive. It’s also the chance to open doors, to meet and to professionally form a new generation,"" stressed Pavlovsky.
 
The chair's opening professor is Emilie Hammen, a teacher and curator who has published works on fashion history. 
 
""Emilie has many qualities and one is that she is a graduate of IFM!  The other is that she has expertise in art, a doctorate; and she has worked with great brands and designers,"" noted Romatet, adding that her office would be in IFM, whose campus is along the Seine, in the 13th arrondissement.
 
Though he promised that at least once in their course every student must go to 19M to appreciate their skills and activities.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 16, 2021","Various institutions have stepped up to the plate, with shows, conferences and public debates, to promote African fashion, which has gained in visibility in recent years thanks to its emerging designers’ increased catwalk presence. A phenomenon that is clear for all to see, attracting the attention of the general public and also of major labels and fashion week organisers, as shown by this season’s busy programme in Paris and Milan. 
The African marathon will begin in Paris on Friday with a genuinely must-see event. It is the “first major Parisian event dedicated to contemporary African fashion and haute couture,” according to the website of Africa Fashion Up, the fashion programme devised by Share Africa, a meeting and discussion platform founded by Franco-Ivorian model Valérie Ka and businessman Arnaud Ventura to promote talented young African designers and entrepreneurs.
 
Africa Fashion Up wishes to “recognise and promote the exuberance currently enjoyed by African fashion, a blend of tradition and modernity, heritage and a global outlook,” and has staged a competition whose winner will be announced on September 17 at the Salomon de Rothschild palace in Paris, at the end of a catwalk show that will present the creations of the programme's five participants: Zac Koné (Ivory Coast), Guy Fabrice Sullivan (Ivory Coast), Natasha Jaume & Carina Louw (South Africa), Souleymane & Laure Tarot (Senegal) and Emmanuel Okoro (Nigeria).The event will be the culmination of two days of meetings between these five designers and various fashion celebrities and institutions in Paris. Notably, Balenciaga, one of the programme’s partners, will offer the participants personalised support over the course of six months, as part of a wider mentorship programme. The designers will also visit the atelier of Cameroonian stylist Imane Ayissi, who last year joined the Paris Haute Couture week calendar, and will meet Sophie Erika, head of Business and Collection Planning at Kenzo Fashion.

Finally, they will also benefit from a training programme delivered by the HEC business school in Paris. At the end of Africa Fashion Up’s catwalk show, the winner of the programme’s first edition will be chosen by a jury of five established African designers: Imane Ayissi, Karim Tassi from Morocco, Martial Tapolo from Cameroon, Eric Raisina from Madagascar and Soraya Da Piedade from Angola.
 
On September 18, again in Paris, a conference on Congo’s dandyish ‘Sape’ subculture (‘Sape’ is the acronym of Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes, French for the society of ambience-makers and elegant people), will be held at 5.45 pm at the National Art History Institute. The conference, entitled ‘La mémoire longue d’une mode populaire: la Sape en Europe et au Congo’, focusing on Sape history and aesthetics from the 19th century to the present, will be held by Manuel Charpy, a specialist in the history of material and visual culture.
 The following week, it will be Milan’s turn to host a series of events shining a spotlight on contemporary African fashion. The first, scheduled at 10 am on September 22, is the collective show ‘We are made in Italy – Black lives matter in Italian Fashion’, unveiling the work of five Italy-based female designers of African origin.
 
The show will be streamed online and is the climax of a project launched exactly a year ago by Italian-Cameroonian designer Michelle Francine Ngomno, head of the Afro Fashion Association, a not-for-profit association she founded in 2015 with Ruth Akutu Maccarthy, from Ghana. The show is sponsored by designers Stella Jean and Edward Buchanan, and supported by Italy's national fashion chamber (CNMI).
 
It will be followed on the same day by the show of designer Joy Ijeoma Meribe, featuring an in-person audience. Nigeria-born Meribe set up her ready-to-wear label, distinctive for its chic, contemporary style and shimmering colours, in the Italian city of Parma in 2017. She took part in last year’s edition of ‘We are made in Italy – Black lives matter in Italian Fashion’, and this year she is making her solo catwalk debut. Among the other African labels included on the Milan fashion week calendar, Nigerian brands Logos Space Programme and Maxivive, and Maison Alvine Demanou, by the eponymous Venice-based Cameroonian designer, who will present their collections online on Monday September 27.
 
CNMI is also launching, for this edition of the Milan fashion week, the ‘Fashion Bridges - I Ponti della Moda’ project in partnership with the Italian embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, and Florentine academy Polimoda. The project will enable four young designers from the South African fashion week (Jacques Bam, Fikile Zamagcino Sokhulu, Sipho Mbuto and Michael Peter Reid), supported by Polimoda alumni Domenico Orefice, Ilaria Bellomo, Julian Cerro and Alessia Dovero, to each design a capsule collection that will be showed in Milan, and then at Johannesburg Fashion Week.
 
In parallel with the women’s fashion week, Milan will also host, on September 23-26, the sixth edition of Afro Fashion Week Milano, organised by the Afro Fashion Association. The event will feature conferences and presentations, focusing this season on recycling and the issue of used garments swamping the African continent, and will also include digital collection presentations and a dozen in-person catwalk shows.
 Six designers, based between Italy and Burkina Faso, Burundi, Kenya, Morocco, the Ivory Coast and Vietnam, will show on Saturday September 25, and another five, all from Cameroon, will do so on Sunday 26, part of the new ‘Fab Five Bridge Builders International’ project, with a strong focus on BIPOC creativity and style. Virgil Abloh has designed a special Off-White t-shirt to support the initiative. The proceeds from the t-shirt's sales, on showroom.afrofashion.org, will be donated to the Afro Fashion Association.
 
Taking over the baton from Milan, Paris Fashion Week will showcase Nigerian designer Kenneth Ize, who will open the fashion week programme with an in-person catwalk show scheduled at 5.30 pm on Monday September 27.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 14, 2021","As part of its ongoing three-year partnership with environmental non-profit Redress, Denver-based apparel group VF Corporation has named Taiwan's Jessica Chang as the winner of the 2021 Redress Design Award. 
The world’s largest sustainable fashion design competition, the Redress Design Award challenges entrants to create environmentally conscious collections.
 
As the winner of the award, Chang will receive mentorship from VF’s Timberland brand and will also collaborate with the outdoor label to design a sustainable apparel collection due to launch in Spring 2023.During this year’s competition, ten finalists from the U.S., the UK, Germany, India and Greater China took part in a series of virtual events held September 1-11. Over the course of these days, the finalists participated in educational challenges and master classes addressing subjects of sustainability and circular design in the fashion industry.
 
At the end of the ten-day period, each finalist showcased a full collection designed in line with the values of the competition.
 
Chang’s unisex collection, entitled ""The Wall,"" impressed the competition’s jury with its creative use of waste materials, as well as for its “strong marketability and commerciality.”
 
The designer will start working with Timberland immediately and will also consult with VF’s sustainability and responsibility team so as to ensure that the materials and design strategies she intends to use meet the company’s sustainability objectives.
 
“The Redress Design Awards showcase what is possible when emerging designs are given an opportunity to innovate around sustainability. We believe cultivating creative, up-and-coming talent is both good for business and a necessity for the future of our planet,” commented VF VP for global sustainability and responsibility Sean Cady.
 
“Sustainable fashion and circular design align with our purpose of bettering both people and the planet. Watching our global teams embrace this sustainability competition and mentor the next generation of designers is incredibly rewarding,” he added.
 
The announcement that Chang has won the 2021 Redress Design Award comes as the capsule collection made by the competition’s 2020 winner, Le Nogc Ha Thu, receives the finishing touches before going on sale in Spring.
 
The Redress Design Award is part of wider sustainability efforts being implemented by VF. Earlier this year, for example, the company, which, alongside Timberland, also owns the Vans and The North Face brands, announced that it had allocated some $596 million generated by its inaugural green bond to 13 sustainability projects.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 14, 2021","Singer and businesswoman Rihanna took to her social channels on Monday to drop a one-minute teaser revealing the all-star cast of the hotly anticipated third fashion show from her lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty, scheduled for the end of September. 
The teaser, which can be viewed via both Rihanna and Savage X Fenty’s social accounts across platforms including Instagram and Twitter, shows flashes of singers, dancers and other artists wearing pieces from the inclusive lingerie label’s latest collection in a variety of urban environments.
 
In among the flashing lights, the video promises performances from rappers Nas, Daddy Yankee and Bia, as well as singers Jazmin Sullivan, Ricky Martin, Normani and Jade Novah.Other show participants listed in the teaser include a who’s who of global modeling talent, with the likes of Irina Shayk, Emily Ratajkowski, Gigi Hadid, Adriana Lima, Joan Smalls, Lola Leon, Alek Wek, Behati Prinsloo, Precious Lee and Soo Joo Park all set to make an appearance.
 
And if that wasn’t enough, Rihanna is also due to be joined by actors Jeremy Pope, Jojo T. Gibbs, Mena Massoud, Thuso Mbedu and Vanessa Hudgens, singers Erykah Badu, Sabrina Carpenter and Troye Sivan, dancer Leiomy, drag queens Gottmik and Symone, and even professional skateboarder Nyjah Huston.
 
Now in its third consecutive year, the Savage X Fenty Show has gained a reputation as a spectacular, star-studded performance piece reflecting the inclusive and empowering messaging of the brand – a well-timed antidote to the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which was canceled in 2019 following questions about the relevance of an event that many found outdated and objectifying.   
True to form, Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 3 will “combine fashion, dance, music, and iconic architecture, highlighting the newest assortment of Savage X Fenty styles through subtle-yet-impactful scenic elements, lighting, and filming techniques,” according to a release.
 
As previously reported, the show will stream exclusively on Amazon Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories around the world, starting Friday, September 24.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 13, 2021","No Ralph, no Tommy and no Calvin, yet still plenty of action in New York Fashion Week this season, which completed five and a half days of shows on Sunday night.

The final major show? Tom Ford, bien sûr, as the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America rounded off a busy week of activity. The most complete official calendar – provided by NYFW The Shows – listed over a hundred scheduled collections. Of which the single most arresting in our view was Khaite, the new star brand of the Empire State.Tom Ford: Instagram individualism in Lincoln CenterOnce Tom Ford injected retro American glamour into major league European houses; now he injects European pizzazz into his own major league label. Eighties Italian optimism and '70s French chic with an LA spin.

Like his Capri pant with blazer combos in golden leopard prints; or his velvet moiré tied-up shirts with velvet jodhpur pants, two star looks in Ford’s spring-summer 2022 collection. In an attention-seeking era, he creates attention-seeking clothes. For attention-seeking clients, just like his audience Sunday, who gathered in the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.Like the delightfully named Saweetie in a barely-there strung together lace up dress, or Pom Klementieff in a micro zebra-print blazer, or Jennifer Hudson in a velvet dressing gown, silk top and leather skirt - all in Imperial Roman purple. Or the keenest attention magnate all of, influencer Camila Coelho in a biomorphic lace mesh mini cocktail in magenta, worn over ultra-bright fuchsia tights.

The clothes were the sort that made all the models walk from their shoulder down. The accessories were big and bold – chunky necklaces, thick gold belts or shiny metallic bracelets. The more the merrier when the model marches in micro sports bra and parakeet-green satin cargo pants tied with golden straps at the ankle. 
Just in case you missed the message, Ford sent out not one but five BTS (meaning 'behind the scenes') event and first looks links.  They featured three times as many guests as models.

“Increasingly people don’t dress in fashion for day but only for night. Or for social media. Instagram may actually be what saves fashion in the end. People now seem to only get dressed up in a major way for a red carpet or to fill their pages with shots of themselves in powerfully stylish clothes. Black doesn’t photograph well and so clothes need to be increasingly cartoon-like to have power on the tiny screens of our phones. It is altering our perception of beauty. It has certainly altered mine,” explained Ford in a forthright release.

A neatly honest description of his intention. Though a sincere appraisal of the show would also suggest that this was the least distinguished collection from Ford in a long time.Khaite: Conceptual sportswear just when you need itNo brand has made such an impact in American fashion this past couple of years as Khaite, the cool conceptual twist on American sportswear invented by designer Catherine Holstein.

Take her opening looks in her show on Sunday – an eight-button military great coat but made in silver satin and worn by Gigi Hadid; or an arty A-line parka in canvas subverted by its contrasting black patch-pocket.

Holstein’s skill is deceptively simple, as she subtly revives classic ideas – like the skillfully draped Grecian muse dresses, revamped with endless strips, ties and criss crosses. This is never fashion with a capital 'F,' but instead clothes that are spruce and sophisticated, that make a woman look as if she is not trying too hard. Like she doesn’t need a professional shopper or stylist to dress her.When Catherine does an oversized silver baseball jacket for Khaite it flatters and never engulfs a lady; when she balloons up enormous shoulder bags into a giant coils they look quirky, not outlandish.

Her color palette – silver; jade; oak and steel – always evoked the key source of inspiration, the dramatic architecture of New York. Yet, the show was set in a semi-darkness with a sandy, leaf-strewn runway, the mood throughout charming. Perfectly style by Vanessa Traina, with a beautiful piece of casting from Piergiorgio Del Moro, this was just what NYC needed this season, a sultry and romantic moment of grace.

Just a pity not many of us Europeans could actually be present to imbibe the moment.

"Sep 12, 2021","The five-and-a-half day New York Fashion Week ended on Sunday, a sunny day after a solemn Saturday in remembrance of the 20th anniversary of 9/11. We had a look at three truly influential designers – Anna Sui, Thom Browne and Tory Burch. The key message: demure fantasy is de rigueur.  
Anna Sui: Paradise in Indochine

Anna, the designer and not editor that is, entitled her latest collection ""Another Day in Paradise,"" and its charming Sgt.-Pepper-style invite foretold an exotic voyage. A prediction that came true with a deliciously daffy range of clothes.Sui’s mood board included everything from Trader Vic’s bar signs and ads for Tahiti, to Honolulu masks and Niki de Saint Phalle catalogues. Sui managed to pack all that and more into this Spring/Summer 2022 collection.
 
I was all unveiled inside Indochine, which has been a favored watering hole of fashion followers for the past three decades. Wacky yet rather wonderful, aided by the Instagram camera angle – perched on this post-French-colonial Vietnamese restaurant’s bar – from its opening look, a blushing pink bikini worn under a Chanel-style jacket in Verner Panton patterns, topped by an enormous tulip-shaped straw hat.
 
Coral chenille cardigans, properly romantic lime green lace dresses, spandex scuba skirts and crocheted uptown hippie tops all came anchored by outdoor sandals or glittery platforms with matching socks. And, like so many designers in New York, Sui showed decorative sporty bras and bloomers, taking lockdown looks and combos out of apartments and onto catwalks.
 
""I dream of escaping to a little-known holiday spot, where the weather is forever sunny, the waves are consistently tasty, and the people are always fun and cool. In my personal Shangri-La, I wake up every day, whenever I want, walk among the chirping birds, soaring palm trees, and delicious-smelling tropical flowers, listen to my favorite music, and order beverages that come with colorful little umbrellas. The mood is forever upbeat and anything goes – it’s Another Day in Paradise!"" commented Anna in her release.
 
The sense of joie de vivre and escapism was palpable in this show, which felt more like a cruise collection than a typical Spring/Summer offering. All aided by super work from Pat McGrath and a makeup palette of rose and sand. Sui’s oeuvre can be a touch saccharine, but when it clicks, as it did this season, it can be rather divine.
 Thom Browne: More artifice than art

Quite why Thom Browne has never directed a feature film begins to be something of a mystery given how cinematic his shows have become. Particularly his event on Saturday night, with a de-Chirico-worthy giant house frame set in a formal French garden, guarded by a squad of feathered spirits and harpies.

Two early figures on the flagstone catwalk cycled around on penny farthings, their faces covered by mesh horses’ heads. Inside the house a couple in bumster suits with trompe-l’oeil designs walked around moodily. Like the cyclist, they wore versions of the gray flannel suit, as indeed did most models in this show.
 
Admittedly Browne did advance his tailoring this season with sleeveless Edwardian topcoats for ladies, and a brilliantly layered bespoke safari jacket, seen when one of his harpies took off their fabric feather coats and circled his garden. However, his foray into dress-making – with almost a score of looks – was stiff and uninspiring.
 
Moreover, far too often it felt like the art and artifice was covering up the lack of innovation in the clothes. Browne’s shows, three times as long as most runway events, recall Pierre Cardin collections for their ponderous longevity. This show made Last Year at Marienbad feel like a thriller.
 
Browne has built a great brand and invented a new way for women to wear formal clothes. But after this weekend’s show it felt like the house needed to change gears rather than just coast on designer autopilot until the next fancy stage set comes along to decorate.
 
Come to think of it, a movie project might just ignite his creative juices.
 Tory Burch: A chaste block party in Soho

A cobblestone block in Soho – Mercer Street with bookstands, vegetables stalls and antique sellers – was the ideal setting for this weekend’s show by Tory Burch.
 
This was as haute bohemian as one can imagine: flouncy to-the-ankle skirts, crinkly plissé tops, oversized mannish pants in hemp, cotton and great double chalk stripes. Multiple looks were dissected by fabric Lonsdale belts. And most models were bearing different bags – buckets, totes and satchels – that all looked utilitarian and great.
 
Burch loves a live performance and this is how her show ended with some balletic body popping by a track-suited dancer, Lil Buck (AKA Charles Riley) who has danced with Benjamin Millepied’s ballet corps accompanied by single snare drummer Cornelio. A joyful ending to a show, whose invitation featured a coloring book pencils and a straw apple.
 
Lots of material and little skin in the most covered-up collection in New York, with barely a limb in sight. Odd then that the soundtrack featured The Jezebel Spirit by Brian Eno and David Byrne, since this cast looked almost devout.
 
Then again this is surely the secret of Tory Burch’s success, she has managed to invent a new paradigm of what it means to be ladylike and coolly fashionable. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 12, 2021","Technology and fashion have come together for an intriguing proposal. Data analysis platform Launchmetrics has made its New York Fashion Week debut with the presentation of its first runway look. The design was created in collaboration with American brand Negris LeBrum and its designer and founder, Travis Hamilton, who wanted to pay tribute to Launchmetrics, having used the platform's tools since 2018. The project's conception goes back to the start of the preparations for ""The Love Story,"" Negris LeBrum's collection for Spring/Summer 2022. On the basis of this creative process, Hamilton spoke to Launchmetrics about his idea of making a runway look which would not be produced for sale and which would feature the company's logo in tones of grey on a piece combining materials such as jacquard, nylon and elastane. For Negris LeBrum, which, among New York brands, is considered one to watch by the CFDA, the initiative reflected the label's desire to thank the data analysis specialist for having ""played a key role sustaining [their] brand with global visibility.""

""The fashion industry can be brutal for the smaller brands like Negris LeBrum, but their technology and services are game-changing. Over the past four years, Launchmetrics has provided us with not only the right content we need to get noticed, but also the tools to showcase it and the right network to connect with to help grow my business,"" explained the founder of the brand, which was inspired by the story of the forbidden love of ""a young beautiful French Creole woman and a handsome man"" in the 1940s, in a release. ""I wanted to thank Launchmetrics for their support,"" added Hamilton, ""and being a designer, naturally, I choose to express myself through my creations.""As for Launchmetrics, the company's chief customer officer, Tatiana Ferreira, highlighted that it has always been the firm's mission ""to listen to the industry and support the way it works, continuously innovating to move forward."" With regard to the importance of creating synergies between different industry players, the executive commented, ""we’re client-focused and view ourselves as their strategic brand partners, so when Travis approached us with his original design, we felt it was an authentic representation of what we’ve always strived to build."" Indeed, according to Ferreira, the company's ultimate objective has always been to be an integral part of its clients' ""journey and growth.""

Led by Michael Jais, Launchmetrics is a data analysis and technology company that develops tools for managing influencer campaigns, building marketing strategies, organizing events and monitoring public relations. With operations in eight markets, the company acquired Italian image bank IMAXtree at the end of 2019 and took over Chinese influencer platform Parklu in November of last year.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 11, 2021","The continuing pandemic, visa rules and vaccinations unapproved by U.S. authorities prevented European editors from attending New York Fashion Week this season, even as dozens of brands returned to the runway for the first time in 18 months. But Instagram, Zoom, Twitter and the CFDA’s oddly erratic platform meant one was able to grasp and garner a good deal of what was new and novel in American fashion.A somber weekend on the 20th anniversary of the infamous 9/11 attacks. Which took place in the middle of another NYC runway season, the morning after a Marc Jacobs show and party on a Hudson River pier, where scores of fashionistas posed for midnight photos with the Twin Towers in the background.
 
New York this fall has so far been a season of optimistic nostalgia and sporty glamor blended with a hint of spiritualism. We look at four key collections from three vital independents and a mega label.Jason Wu: Offbeat impressionism

A lot of private time in the pandemic was clearly useful for Jason Wu, who unveiled one his best shows ever on Friday at lunchtime.
 
Jason staged his latest show in a downtown gallery, bedecked with extended plants and flowers, around which his cast walked. Continuing that theme, a trio of black and anthracite floral-print looks, with the details sponged on – a suit made of a bolero and cardigan, a curvaceous gown, and a sheath – were all rather marvelous.
 
Wu’s boldest ideas were the abstract expressionist tie-dye prints, seen in grand crinolines, or some really great cutaway cocktails, that exposed acres of leg. As did a combo of lilac cashmere sweater and sequined skirt.
 
All together this was a Gone-with-the-Wind-meets-the-urban-jungle collection that managed to be romantic yet also punchy. Other versions of the modernist Vivien Leigh dress came in canary yellow or faded black. 
 
Indeed, Jason’s decision to work with fabric-maker Cara Marie Piazza and her offbeat impressionist ideas took this collection to another level. Wu is normally a better winter than summer designer, whose jazzed up parkas are must-haves in the bitter cold days of January and February in New York. But this was a fine statement, and probably Jason’s most memorable expression of springtime fashion ever.Coach: Bonnie Cashin Buffalo Gals

Few designers anywhere have a more acute sense of the visual pun than Stuart Vevers at Coach.
 
His latest show for the giant brand was preceded by all sorts of wacky shows on Coach TV, available on Instagram, starring camp comperes and all shot in retro Sony Trinitron 1970s hues.
 
While his take on the latest version of the Bonnie Cashin bag, named after the house’s original designer, came with recycled or faux leather strap or trompe-l’oeil sketches. There was also a great loose cotton sweatshirt, over which was written ""Coach Leatherware."" The mini-clip of that look, came with the tagline, ""Subverting American Classics Since 1941.""
 
""Spring presents my vision of a new vocabulary of American fashion. It’s a celebration too of the colorful, upbeat optimism of Bonnie Cashin,"" explained Vevers.
 
Which was apparent in the great parkas and raingear made in giant houndstooth or windowpane checks – all worn with micro sporty bras, bovver boots and denim dude shorts with jockey pant tops exposed.
 
In a coed show, guys wore bright-hued, big-pocketed parkas; checked dhotis and t-Shirts that read, ""Super Grump.""
 
What’s great about UK-born Vevers is that, while so many designers who live in New York retreated this past year to the Hamptons or their cottage in the Berkshires, Stuart got out there and embraced New York. He really rubs shoulders with New Yorkers, and that shows in his collections, especially this one. 
 
Hence his intro clips on Coach TV featured four lasses marching out of a subway station on the No. 1 line, to the tune of ""Buffalo Gals,"" by his fellow Brit, the late great Malcolm McLaren.
 
Its tagline read: ""Real New Yorkers know the best way to get to where you need to go is the subway."" Dead right.Brandon Maxwell: Sporty entrance-making glamour

Gigi Hadid really does get all the best looks. Case in point, the all-silver statement the new mum wore Friday night in the latest show by America’s reigning master of classical glamour, Brandon Maxwell.
 
Made of a silver cloud print, the pantsuit with peak-shoulder jacket was, well, perfectly cut. And given even more attitude by Gigi placing her hands in the trouser pockets, with the jacket fully opened to show off a matching bra. Talk about an owning-the-room entrance-maker of a combo.
 
Hadid’s fan clubs on Twitter and Instagram instantly celebrated with mini videos of her returning backstage amid prolonged cheers.
 
Born in Texas, though very much a New Yorker, six years after founding his house here, Maxwell began his fashion career as a stylist. And those stylist’s habits were very evident in this collection. 
 
Maxwell, 36, likes his glamour served straight up, with not too many frills – from the Japanese setting-sun posh hippie print column in orange and purple, to the ruched-up zebra-print cocktails. Though his most refreshing ideas were psychedelic dresses and tops that added an unexpected twist.
 
Put together, this was a sleek and savvy statement by Maxwell, yet one could not help wishing that there might be a little more of Brandon’s boyish origins in East Texas and a little less urban glamour next season.Rodarte: Amazon Live from Bank Street
 
Rodarte streamed their show directly on Amazon Live, capturing their runway show staged at 155 Bank Street at noon on Saturday. Models marched inside a West Village sculpture garden located, just 20 blocks north of where the Twin Towers once stood.
 
It turned out to be by far and away the most arresting collection in New York so far. 
 
The Los Angeles-based duo of sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who founded Rodarte, cut with exuberance, most notably their great deep-gorge blouses with superhero shoulders – but made of Victorian schoolmarm lace. 
 
Beautifully ruched and draped dresses preceded elongated caftans over matching pants, while for racier moments, there were boudoir semi-sheer guipure dresses showing lots of lingerie, in black, virginal white and sinful red. For awards ceremonies – superb floral print blazers or eye popping sequined cloaks of sunset
 
Dangling sequined strip screen goddess looks wowed, as did acid floral cheongsams, worn on models with gothic arch eye makeup.
 
Not everything clicked into place – the accordion pleat shirts looked rather old fashioned – but overall this was the most intriguing show in the American season.
 
And subtly considered in the finale, where the entire cast appeared like priestesses in pure sheathes of ecru, vanilla, rose and yellow, each model wearing a slim gold necklace, to end posing on concrete columns. Carefully poised on a day where the world recalled the almost 3,000 souls lost on that day of infamy.
 
With a solemn soundtrack playing Dallas Acid’s ""Spa Hunter,"" the sisters took their bows almost gingerly in floral pajamas and western shirts, after a moment of grace on the 20th anniversary of 9/11.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 10, 2021","With New York Fashion Week in full swing, experts from the Pantone Color Institute have lifted the veil on the colors that will be showing up in our wardrobes for the spring-summer 2022 season. Symbolizing the emotions stirred up by nearly two years of pandemic, between lockdowns, closures, cancellations and anxiety, the palette is both soft and dynamic, reflecting a need for serenity but also a relentless quest for freedom.As part of the various events and launches at New York Fashion Week, Pantone revealed its traditional Fashion Color Trend Report for Spring/Summer 2022, showing that men and women will vacillate between the need for comfort and security, and the desire for spontaneity next summer. ""Colors for Spring 2022 bring together our competing desires for comforting familiarity and joyful adventure through a range of soothing and timeless colors, along with joyous hues that celebrate playfulness,"" said Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute.

This quest for softness, serenity, and security, should make its way into outfits and accessories tinted with blue, which comes in four shades including Spun Sugar, a light pastel, Glacier Lake, synonymous with tranquility, and Harbor Blue that Pantone associates with ""our search for a safe space."" This palette, which highlights balance and comfort, is completed by a delicate powder pink, Gossamer Pink, and a brown, Coca Mocha, symbol of a calming spirit.But the daring among us, in search of adventure, spontaneity, and optimism after this trying period, will undoubtedly turn to more dynamic colors. Expressing ourselves in a liberated, bold fashion  via vibrant shades like blue -- once again -- but this time in Skydiver, a more pronounced shade which, according to Pantone, ""inspires us to new heights"". The purple Dahlia shade also signals a certain dynamism.

An explosive trio completes this palette marked by vividness: the striking red Poinciana, the flamboyant pink Innuendo, and, brighter than ever, the yellow Daffodil, synonymous with, among other things, renewal. Note that Pantone adds to these ten colors a palette of five great timeless classics composed of a pure white, a sandy shade, two grays, one pale and one dark, and a green that evokes ""health and wellness. A color chart that reminds us of the uncertain times the world has just gone through.

"Sep 10, 2021","It's impossible not to recognize the silhouette of the late Karl Lagerfeld, with his legendary white shirts, his catogan hair ribbon, and his black glasses. This look contributed to the fame of the great German fashion designer, and from this Friday, September 10,  it will also adorn a selection of digital figurines, the very first NFT of the brand he himself founded.Just like the art world, the fashion industry has embraced NFTs, non-fungible tokens that represent digital objects, from artworks to clothing and fashion accessories. The possibilities seem endless, as proven today by the Karl Lagerfeld brand, which is offering its first collection of NFTs in the form of digital figurines featuring the great German fashion designer and photographer, as revealed by Women's Wear Daily (WWD).

It will be available starting Friday, September 10, Karl Lagerfeld's date of birth. Customers of the brand and those nostalgic for the emblematic look of the great designer will be able to buy themselves an animated figurine in his likeness with, of course, all the clothes and accessories that are the signature of the former artistic director of the house Chanel.Available to buy via The Dematerialised platform, the NFTs will be available in a limited edition, and in two versions. The first will be available at a price of 77 euros, and this for 777 consumers, while the second, more luxurious but also rarer, will be sold for 177 euros in just 77 examples. The number 7 was chosen as a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld who considered it his lucky number. Specialized site WWD specifies that it will be possible to update the look of the figurine later.

Fashion and cosmetics industries are gradually embracing NFTs, as Dolce & Gabbana recently unveiled a collection of nine NFT pieces, for men and women, in collaboration with UNXD, alongside their physical counterparts, while Burberry and Gucci have also experimented with this.

"Sep 10, 2021","The pandemic may be a long way from being over, but they are parading down the catwalks in New York this week.Uber sunny in mood and attitude, designers appear to be longing for a return to normalcy, even if a new normalcy comes with a nervous sense of escapism and a heightened desire for long weekends and country living.

We checked out four key Spring/Summer 2022 collections in shows spread across the city – Proenza Schouler, Moschino, Carolina Herrera and Michael Kors – as major league houses and influential designers returned to the runway in force in the six-day American season that ends on Sunday.Proenza Schouler: Downtown damsels on the beach

Damsels but definitely not in distress at Proenza Schouler, still a bellwether brand when it comes to interpreting what’s next in American fashion.
 
Their Wednesday evening show was staged before the backdrop of water, and the signature wooden fencing found on the Atlantic beaches of North America. Which, considering that so many professional New York ladies now essentially work a four-day week, starting their weekends in the Hamptons most Thursday evenings, seemed truly apt.
 
That said, this was very much an urban collection from designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez for Spring/Summer 2022.
 
Brimful of powerful tailoring, from the opening slope-shoulder safari jacket or the Superwoman parka to the sleeveless wraparound deerskin trenches – one in ecru the other in dark chocolate – or a marvelous yellow zebra power coat. 
 
Clothes for easy travel in a new, almost post-professional era, where people can escape the confines of offices and dress in a far more romantic manner. Like the great chess piece dresses, finished with beads, spaghetti-like fringes and side cut-outs – seen in canary yellow or amaranth red.
 
The show climaxed with a trio of high-color pastel floor-length gowns that were tremendously classy and very new. All anchored by mannish loafers and tough chic sandals, and worn with some great Dia Day Bags, jazzed up with hand woven raffia and technical faux crocodile.
 
""A celebration of newfound freedoms, however fragile they may seem, coupled with an absolute optimism for all that lies ahead,"" was how the duo defined the collection.  
Moschino: Fashion pasture

The weather gods didn’t shine on Moschino this season, but the gods of wit and invention were in a kinder mood. Staged under a steady drizzle in Bryant Park, the collection was a humorous and kicky expression of upbeat fashion by the wittiest designer in the industry, Jeremy Scott.
 
Playing on pop retro ideas and nursery school prints he sent out short A-line dresses with puff sleeves, and mini flamenco jackets with even more miniature skirts and matching bustiers. While the most flattering of picnic dresses had buttons made of large pink hearts.
 
Jeremy’s favorite fabrics for next spring are naïve pastel prints with lots of pink bears, turquoise elephants and lilac lambs – great kids’ bedroom wallpaper ideas. Finished with endless bangles, beaded afros and high heels in a kaleidoscope of sweetshop hues. All the cast strutting by with matching handbags – color-coordinated to the max.
 
""Sweet dreams are indeed made of these,"" commented Scott, who ensured that ladies who lunch have rarely looked happier.
 
Faintly absurdist – but then again, that was a key element in Franco Moschino’s DNA – the animal prints became three-dimensional at the finale.
 
His stellar cast – from Gigi Hadid to Imaan Hammam– strolling by, as photographers scurried to their seats and the masked guests cowered under large golf umbrellas. Climaxing with Scott’s own bow and appearance with the beautiful transgender Antiguan-American model, Aaron Philip, in a wheelchair. 
Carolina Herrera: Uptown gal celebrates her 40th

Designer Wes Gordon celebrated the house of Carolina Herrera’s 40th anniversary with an intimate show staged in a storied townhouse in the Upper East Side.
 
Carolina Herrera has always been one of Manhattan’s most patrician houses, and this collection was no exception. Puff-shouldered versions of Carolina’s key look – the ladylike white suit; majestic and grand black and white silk gowns, or kissing punk jacquard cocktails: all unmistakably Carolina Herrera.
 
Under Gordon, the Herrera gal has gotten a decade younger – seen in the beautiful white cotton shirts with puckered floral detailing and Jesuitical sleeves, or the racy micro cocktails in crimson and cream sequined check. Best of all, he played on the classic Carolina polka-dots with a new logo-lettered print in some great dresses.
 
Though Wes’ best ideas were probably his grandest – anthracite sequined bustiers over gigantesque swirls of satin, or jet micro dresses with enormous trains.
 
In a sense the collection was a brave bet on the future, that society will really reopen next spring with benefits and balls, weddings and wicked weekends. Hope Wes wins that bet. 
Michael Kors: Good times in Central Park

America’s most ebullient designer, Michael Kors, returned to nature this season with a show inside Tavern on the Green, the famed restaurant just on the western side of Central Park.
 
It felt like old times with a gaggle of stars – like Kate Hudson who iPhoned the final – perched front row, beside the house’s new CEO Joshua Schulman and the brand’s ultimate arbiter, John D Idol, the CEO of its owner, Capri.
 
Though staged in a verdant park, the clothes were decidedly urban – halter neck little black dresses, flared leather skirts, and ultra-slouchy trench-coats in pink or ecru.
 
For evening, a divine leather sheath with cut-outs and several great confetti guipure pencil-narrow cocktail dresses or full skirts topped by singlets. For a weekend at the beach, black cashmere sweaters with a red heart and a hand across it.
 
Several models did carry totes and bucket bags, some with roses popping out, though this ode to jet set glamour felt a tad out of step with the current ethos.
 
Backed up by stand-up bassist and torch singer Ariana DeBose, crooning through classics like My Baby Just Cares For Me, it was a highly polished display, where Kendall Jenner and most of cast sported waxed back hair and ruby red lips.
 
In a word, this was far from being Michael Kors' greatest collection, but as at least it was an expression of optimism after the endless lockdowns.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 9, 2021","Most people when they think of Germany this month will think of politics not fashion, as voters will select the successor to chancellor Angela Merkel in two weeks’ time. 
This week, the country also witnessed the three-day Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin, with the nation’s capital covered in political posters in an election pundits say is too close to call.
 
One of the remarkable things about the 16-year-reign of Angela – always pronounced like 'angle' and not 'angel' – is that she managed to make Germany far stronger in Europe without alarming its European neighbors. The same is not true in fashion. For, if anything, it remains a mystery quite why German culture, which is highly influential in such creative pursuits as fine art, architecture and photography, has if anything lost ground in fashion during Merkel’s era.When Angela came to power Karl Lagerfeld staged the biggest shows in the world at Chanel, the single most important couture brand; Jil Sander had founded and led feminist fashion and Berlin had a burgeoning club and street fashion scene. Today, the few prominent young Mitteleuropean designers – Luke and Lucie Meier at Jil Sander, GmbH founded by Serhat Isik and Benjamin Huseby, and recently hired by Trussardi, or indies like Lutz Huelle – all plough their furrows abroad. 
 
Indeed, it’s hard to recall a German designer who made it to the final of the LVMH Prize, fashion’s richest award for young talent.
 
Part of the explanation is that over the past decade Germans didn’t really want much change. In an uncertain world, their economy prospered and they re-elected Merkel four times.
 
Fashion, however, thrives on change, and the first seeds of a renaissance were visible in an element of great importance in Germany, the environment. The whole ecological movement was born with the Greens here, and their ideas about sustainability, upcycling and local and honest sourcing permeated many collections presented inside Kraftwerk, a former power plant in former East Berlin that was the nerve center of the season. A Mercedes-Benz concept car made with hipster DJ and designer Heron Preston, who also made a capsule collection of recycled airbags from the automaker – took pride of place in the raw concrete space. 
Brands like Lutz Morris, led by Tina Morris, a brilliant accessory designer, who returned to Berlin after two decades in New York working for the likes of Calvin Klein and Issey Miyake. Defined as new luxury design made in Germany, Morris sources almost exclusively from German leathers, with chains from the Black Forest, and works with local artisans, selling 90% of her beautiful bags online.
 
Or Moot, which stands for Made Out Of Trash, whose founder Michael Pfeifer joined Morris on a panel inside Kraftwerk, along with Julia Leifert and Mira von der Osten of Cruba. It stands for Create Revolutions in the Berlin Argument, a brand that uses 3D technology. All meeting for a discussion on Fashion and Digitalization led by Der Spiegel style editor Philipp Löwe. Pfeifer came dressed in a T-shirt made of an old bed-sheet; pants of former curtains and a jacket from an old wool blanket – which looked pretty natty.
 
One of several discussions inside Kraftwerk, as industry leaders struggle to detect a path ahead. All held under the auspices of the Fashion Council Germany, whose chairperson is Christiane Arp, the respected former editor in chief of German Vogue. 
However, last year,  in a major disruption to German fashion, the inventive trade salon Premium decamped to financial capital Frankfurt, its organizers lamenting publically the lack of support for fashion from the local Berlin left-wing administration.

Nonetheless, Berlin Fashion Week, which is now backed by the local Berlin senate, did manage to stage almost dozen actual fashion runway shows, most notably by William Fan and Fassbender. The latter blending Hanseatic hauteur with Balearic panache in a collection inspired by Ibiza.
 
Bold seaside striped pants and matching waistcoats; fluid alpaca coats sourced from animal-friendly farms and swirling aqua blue countesses’ flamenco dresses all made for easily the most polished show in Berlin.
 Fiona BennettIf the action on the runway was modest, there was plenty to see elsewhere, beginning with Fiona Bennett, the city’s most famous milliner, whose airy store in Schoeneberg is a must-see boutique.
 
Born in Britain and brought up in Brighton, Bennett moved with her family to Berlin before the Wall came down, going on to learn classic hat-making techniques - apparent in some great felt gents’ fedoras that recalled Otto Dix paintings and naughty boys in Cabaret.

But Bennett’s most beautiful ideas were her dramatic conical straw hats, made in Ghana. 
 
“It’s the definition of sustainable; the hats are made by by real experts in weaving, a group of villagers living deep in the countryside,” smiled Bennett, whose creations have featured in shows by Wolfgang Joop and Michael Michalsky.
 
Add in some marvelous swirling straw concoctions worthy of My Fair Lady and dainty straw florals for summer weddings and one realized Bennett fully merits her reputation as one of the world’s greatest milliners.
 Working Title One brand that captures the urban elegance of contemporary Berlin is Working Title, a labor of love by a very cool couple – Antonia Goy and Bjoern Kubeja.
 
The duo operates out of a fully function atelier, in a space they share with fine and graphic artists near Merkel’s chancellor’s office.
 
“Our key influence is the city of Berlin, its energy and architecture; its gardens and surrounding lakes,” explained Kubeja.
 
Concentrating on mono-color luxe fabrics like perfectly pleated wools or bio cottons, Working Title offers a truly sophisticated wardrobe for urban professionals all cut with great aplomb – most notably the beautiful men’s shirtings made for women. Every look reeked of art openings, quality restaurants and insider soirées.
 Natascha von HirschhausenOne brand walking the walk when it comes to sustainability is Natascha von Hirschhausen, who invented the concept of No Waste Cutting.
 
A sketch she showed of typical CAD/CAM cutting showed that many conventional cuts can waste up to 20% of the material. Natascha, by contrast, only loses 0.5% on her cuts, and she turns those tiny scraps into fabric earrings.
 
“I did a student exchange in Bangladesh, a country I loved for its beauty and people, but was shocked to discover it is completely littered in small scraps of fabric. Which is when I decided something had to change,” said von Hirschhausen, in a visit to her studio/apartment in the residential West Berlin district of Wedding.
 
The result was a skillful collection where the extra folds of fabric added an astute sense of volume to her “size-fluent” silvery pea-silk blouses; voluminous organic denim workers pants; and some great rock-star at the weekend cutaway sweatshirts. All from a designer that won the Federal Award for Ecodesign 2017 shortly after she founded her house.
 William Fan: Ceremonial Mitte-Mode William Fan is a Chinese national who has made Berlin his home, and the capital’s hipster denizens were the inspiration for his latest collection.
 
In one of the few shows on the Berlin calendar, Fan unveiled his collection inside a huge, looming disused factory, of which there are so many examples in this city.
 
Fan likes a dressed-up look and creates clothes in grand jacquards; floral brocades and dark serge wools. He cuts his clothes with a certain ceremonial style, whether for men or women.
 
Though his biggest idea was an indented cement-hued cotton used in smock like dresses; airy trenches or blousons. Often he dressed men and women in highly similar looks – heavy silk priestly coats or brocade cloak-like looks.
 
The key element is that Fan is a talented tailor – from his cloak-like Eisenhower jackets paired with tailored dhotis to following monsignor calico coats.
 
Born in Hong Kong, Fan moved to Europe to study fashion before ending up in Berlin and debuting his own label in 2015. Fan is something of a local star, and has the self-assurance to match. His inspiration was the neighborhood in which he lives, hyper-central Mitte, which means Middle in German. 
 
“We’ve been locked up for over a year, so the people who have been inspired me are young people I see walking around my own neighborhood,” said the lanky Fan.
 
Fan even hired some of the kids in what the French call 'un casting sauvage,' mixed in with professional models.  
 Marcel OstertagHowever, the oddest event was by Marcel Ostertag, whose show outside the elegantly dilapidated St Elisabeth church was partly aided by Mercedes-Benz rival Opel. 
Staged with some flourish, the collection was often made in the same hue as the car and a pair of Opel socks every guest was given in their goodie bag. We are not sure what the German for 'naff' is, but that sums it up.

"Sep 9, 2021","The tribute planned for Alber Elbaz is shaping up to be one of the highlights of this season's Paris Fashion Week. And there's not a speech or an institutional commemoration in sight, just a runway presentation, which will close the French capital's fashion week on October 5. The show will unveil a collection designed by AZ Factory, the house launched by the designer just before his death, as well as a series of looks conceived by more than 40 designers, including young talents and established couture stars, all of whom will reinterpret the bold and innovative Elbaz style.
 ""We are going to celebrate Alber with this show, where, as well as the tribute collection made by his design studio, over 40 designers will participate, each making a look,"" explained the house to FashionNetwork.com, without providing further details about the show's location or about the other initiatives that should accompany the event.

Among the designers invited to take part in the show, entitled ""Love Brings Love,"" a number of big names have apparently already agreed, including Dior's creative director of womenswear, Maria Grazia Chiuri; her counterpart at Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesquière; Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia; Rick Owens, and Pierpaolo Piccioli, who currently leads design at Valentino. The whole luxury industry will therefore be coming together in order to commemorate Elbaz. Furthermore, the show will be put together by the designer's former collaborators, including Etienne Russo, founder of events company Villa Eugénie; makeup icon Pat McGrath; hairstylist Guido Palau; stylist Babeth Dijan, and DJ and musician Ariel Wizman. 

AZ Factory, the ""morpho-techno-democratic"" couture brand launched by the famous designer in collaboration with Swiss luxury giant Richemont at the start of 2021, only just had the time to present a first collection during Paris Haute Couture Week in January before the death of its founder on April 24 due to complications linked to Covid-19.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 8, 2021","“The trend is reversing. At last, we’re able to enjoy the city. Forza Italia! Forza Milano!” said Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI), as he ended his online/in-person press conference with undisguised enthusiasm on Tuesday, presenting the next edition of the Milan fashion week. It will be held on September 21-27 and will showcase the women's ready-to-wear collections for the Spring/Summer 2022.An edition that is set to mark a return to a degree of normality, with physical events in a majority. Between presentations, special features and catwalk shows, the Milan fashion week's programme includes a total of 173 events, of which only 46 will be held exclusively in digital format. Notably, there will be 65 catwalk shows, 42 of them with a live audience.
 
Yet, this doesn't mean web coverage is being jettisoned, far from it in fact. Milan Fashion Week will continue to be streamed live online as in the last few seasons, and CNMI has set up a TikTok account, focusing on the event’s backstage coverage. It has also signed up a number of influencers from the UK, France and the US, who will hold a panel discussion on diversity on Instagram.Capasa underlined that a Covid pass will be mandatory to attend each of the events on the official calendar. CNMI will also offer free Covid tests for everyone with an accreditation for the fashion week.
 
Milan Fashion Week will kick off on Tuesday 21 with a dozen events, among them the opening of Fashion Hub, the space dedicated to emerging designers, and also a special launch organised by Benetton. The catwalk show marathon will begin on Wednesday 22, opening with the collective digital showcase ‘Black Lives Matters in Italian Fashion’, putting five talented immigrant designers centre-stage.
  
Among the fashion week's highlights, Roberto Cavalli's catwalk come-back under Creative Director Fausto Puglisi. Moncler and Boss will also be making their return on the official show calendar, which includes six new entries: the MM6 line by Maison Margiela, Luisa Spagnoli, Hui, Vitelli, Joy Meribe and Maison Alvine Demanou. 
Several Italian labels will be showing live again, among them Fendi, Alberta Ferretti, N°21, Jil Sander, Max Mara, Etro, Giorgio Armani, Blumarine, Ermanno Scervino, MSGM, Tod’s, Missoni, Prada, Versace, Salvatore Ferragamo, Dolce & Gabbana and Marni. Also showing, a number of emerging labels like Marco Rambaldi, Del Core and Act N°1.

Dsquared2, Antonio Marras, GCDS, Emilio Pucci and Philipp Plein have instead once again opted to unveil their latest collection with an online video. Notably, no fewer than 12 rookies will feature on the official presentation schedule: Cormio, Quira, Andreadamo, Defaience by Nicola Bacchilega, Roberto Di Stefano, Aniye By, Iuri, Traffico, Radica Studio, Airin Tribal and ATXV - the majority of them with a virtual presentation.
 
A plethora of special events will dial up the Milan fashion week's intensity, among them the celebrations for Emporio Armani’s 40th anniversary, for eyewear producer Marcolin’s 60th, and for Chiara Boni’s five-decade career in fashion. Plus of course all the parties and exclusive dinners organised by the various labels, and the array of projects staged by CNMI in parallel to the main programme, mostly focusing on sustainability and the promotion of emerging designers.
 
Instead, the Green Carpet Fashion Awards, introduced by CNMI in 2017 in partnership with British consultancy firm Eco-Age, founded by Livia Firth, will not be celebrated this season. Eco-Age has withdrawn from the partnership, and the awards have changed name and format. Now rechristened CNMI Sustainable Fashion Awards, they will be back on the Milanese event’s calendar in 2022.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 6, 2021","After a long hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic, New York is opening its Spring/Summer 2022 Fashion Week with the return of in-person runway shows featuring big names like Tom Ford and Altuzarra.But Covid-related curbs will deprive the series of some of its usual international flavor as it rolls out this week.

The pandemic overshadowed the last two fashion weeks, in September 2020 and February 2021, as both were dominated by virtual runway shows.Steven Kolb, chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), says he sees room for both digital and in-person shows.

But ""there is a real optimism and energy and enthusiasm about returning to live shows,"" he added.

""There is, of course, nothing you can compare to a live show.""

In New York, whose fashion shows precede those of London, Milan and Paris, there is no shortage of iconic runway settings, as with Tommy Hilfiger's Apollo Theater show in 2019 or Michael Kors' Studio 54-themed event the same year.

On Thursday evening, LaQuan Smith will present his collection atop the Empire State Building, capping a day including shows by Moschino, Sergio Hudson and Carolina Herrera.

On Tuesday, the founder of Collina Strada, Hillary Taymour, will confirm her environmentally conscious approach with a show on a rooftop garden in Brooklyn.

""This is an important moment for New York, and we're proud to support the city and the industry,"" said Michael Kors.

""We're resilient,"" added Steven Kolb. ""And we're optimistic.""The Covid factorFashion Week this year overlaps with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's own fashion extravaganza, a high point of the city's social calendar, set for Monday.

This year's Met Gala has a distinctively youthful imprint, hosted by singer Billie Eilish, actor Timothee Chalamet, poet Amanda Gorman and tennis star Naomi Osaka, none of them older than 25.

But in a city that has been slammed by Covid-19 -- and again in recent days by historic flooding -- the return to normal is coming slowly.

Fashion Week's organizers have announced a strict protocol: All guests and participants must be vaccinated, masks are recommended -- though not for runway models -- and audience sizes are limited.

According to the CFDA, ""a large percentage"" of the 91 official events will take place outdoors, while some labels continue to rely on digital presentations.

And with travel to the United States still banned from many countries, ""there will be many of our normal international guests... not getting to New York,"" Kolb told AFP.

But he insisted that he has ""no concern that the impact will not reach an international audience. It'll just reach them"" virtually.'Less routine'Even before the pandemic, the American fashion world faced some major defections, with onetime tentpoles like Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger dropping high-end lines or moving their shows elsewhere. New York had also lost designers like Pyer Moss, Rihanna and Victoria Beckham.

This time, the CFDA has been touting the return of Thom Browne and Joseph Altuzarra, who earlier left New York for Paris.

The week gets fully underway on Tuesday with Christian Siriano and Collina Strada.

Also on the calendar are Liberian-American stylist Telfar Clemens, whose vegan leather shopping bag created a sensation, and Peter Do, the young designer who grew up on a small farm in Vietnam and is now taking part in his first Fashion Week.

The week closes on Sunday with shows by big names Tory Burch, Oscar de la Renta and Tom Ford.

Meantime, the pandemic, by at least temporarily de-emphasizing in-person shows, has left some designers with mixed feelings.

""I don't think designers necessarily feel the pressure to show every season, as some of them have maybe once felt,"" said Cathleen Sheehan, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

""It's a tremendous relief for a lot of brands, because shows are incredibly expensive.

""It's less of an obligation and a routine. There's more freedom.""

"Sep 6, 2021","Dior’s Kim Jones has designed the official off-field uniforms for Paris Saint-Germain, the best-financed football team in the game, led by most famous attackers from Argentina and Brazil, Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr. 
Jones, the artistic director of Dior’s men’s collections, will create the dedicated looks for PSG for the next two seasons. The first looks were revealed on Monday.
 
PSG’s colors are midnight blue and red, but for their formal attire Kim has respected Dior’s traditional hues of navy blue and somber gray, most notably in a series of crisp suits –composed of single breasted, two-button jackets with slim lapels, and flat-front pants. Complemented by slim jacquard ties finished with a matching Paris Saint-Germain logo.For more casual moments there are Harrington jackets; clinging knitted sweaters and polo shirts, all embroidered with the PSG patch logo and finished with ‘CD’ initials.
 
UK national Jones also created Derby shoes in black leather, finished with the classic Dior Oblique motif. 
 
When the weather turns this fall expect the players in deconstructed cashmere single-breasted Crombie-style coats. For travel, Dior has also developed an emblematic saddle bag in black grained calfskin; and cashmere scarves and a reversible bag in black and navy blue.
 
With the PSG link-up Dior joins an elite group of fashion brands that have dress major European teams: Versace at Real Madrid; Dsquared2 at Manchester City; Dolce & Gabbana for AC Milan; Lanvin for Arsenal and Giorgio Armani at the Italian national squad. PSG has already been attired by another brand within the LVMH empire, Berluti, when its then creative director Alessandro Sartori dressed the squad led by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
 
However, the arrival of a half dozen new major players in a massive recruitment drive this summer means attention has never before been so focused on PSG, which is owned by Qatari Investment Authority.As part of the link-up, the fashion house also released a video of key PSG players visiting Dior for a fitting, and being photographed at their Parc des Princes stadium. As tailors nip and hem their looks, a series of key players make appearances including Marco Verratti, Angel Di Maria and goalie Keylor Navas. Along with a series of major new signings – which PSG have bought to reinforce their goal of achieving their Holy Grail, winning the Champions League, club soccer’s most important tournament. 
 
New arrivals like Sergio Ramos, Gigi Wijnaldum, and Gianluigi Donnarumma who speak a blend of languages – French, English, Spanish and Portuguese.
 
“Very elegant and it gives me more confidence,” says Neymar admiring the minimalist cashmere coat, his hair frosted like a white magnum.
 
Messi, however, is nowhere to be seen. However, the world’s best paid player, and potentially the missing element in PSG’s hunt for their first Champions League title, did wear Dior when he first arrived in Paris last month, after being signed from Barcelona. Messi will also wear Dior at official engagements, though the Argentine ace also has his own long-term fashion brand, The Messi Store, under the creative direction of Ginny Hilfiger, the sister of the great America designer, Tommy Hilfiger.

"Sep 2, 2021","Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin opens on Monday with a strikingly varied array of events both virtual and live, a hyper-hybrid season with Germany poised to enter a new political era this month. 
In an action-packed three days, the season will include panel talks; fashion film premieres; dynamic salons; and a series of live shows. Much of it centered at Kraftwerk, the renovated former power station located in the central Mitte district. The country’s iconic automaker will open the season with a parade to promote young talent, as part of its Fashion Talents program set up by Mercedes-Benz.
 
The season takes place just weeks before Germany’s next federal election on September 26, with polls still not remotely clear on who will replace Christian Democrat Chancellor Angela Merkel after 16 years in power ending with her as Europe’s pre-eminent politician.Expect debates to also rage at this fashion week, especially at the 202030 - The Berlin Fashion Summit which debuts on Tuesday and is focused on innovation and sustainable development. Where a wide range of academics, thinkers and executives will guide discussions on such topics as Fashion and the Anthropocene, Circular Fashion Systems and Closed Loop Pilots. Much-anticipated moments will be a keynote by Orsola de Castro, the noted founder of Fashion Revolution, who will focus on Local Culture – Global Impact; and Tamsin Blanchard (Curator of Fashion Open Studio or FOS); and Claudia Hofmann on how fashion can embrace true equality.
 
Under the acronym FOS x MBFW, this will be the second edition of Fashion Open Studio, part of the drive to a more eco-responsible approach. In cooperation with Fashion Revolution Germany, the initiative promotes innovative design talent and provides transparent insight into the design and manufacturing processes of brands. 
Another key element is the Berliner Salon, curated and hosted by a grand dame of the local fashion scene, Christiane Arp. The noted former editor-in-chief of Vogue Germany, Arp will also host a 'Firesidechat' on the final evening in the legendary Borchardt brasserie, a preferred dining experience of both insider politicians and cool fashionistas.
 
The city’s eclectic blend of experiences also includes the premiere of Fantastic Voyage, a documentary set around Polish-born designer Dawid Tomaszewski's second home in Portugal; runway shows by such distinctive talents as William Fan and Marcel Ostertag; and Berlin Berlin, a showcase of local art, fashion, design and music from the inventive platform Highsnobiety.

Several major spaces will also be installed in Kraftwerk, where happening creators like Danny Reinke, Fassbender, Isabel Vollrath, Kilian Kerner and Rebekka Ruétz, among others, will present their projects.
 
Under the slogan 'Committed to Responsibility,' the week - supported by the Senate Department for the Economy, Energy and Business - is positioned in terms of sustainable development and designed to send a strong environmental message globally.
 
“The future of fashion is being negotiated in Berlin. The Berlin Fashion Summit offers the perfect platform for this. It is where sustainability trends are highlighted, value creation and products are rethought and the bridge between innovation, sustainability and creative culture is built,” insists Ramona Pop, senator for the Economy, Energy and Affairs Berlin.
 
And for those not able to make it to the German capital, all presentations will be broadcast live on the Mbfw.berlin digital platform and on social networks.

"Sep 2, 2021","Camille Miceli officially joined the Emilio Pucci brand on September 1. Her appointment as artistic director, which FashionNetwork.com reported on last month, has now been confirmed by LVMH. Previously, Miceli held the role of creative director for accessories at Louis Vuitton. Her arrival at Pucci comes on the heels of the French luxury giant's announcement in June that it has acquired the entirety of the Florentine fashion house, of which it had held 67% since 2000. Miceli "" will begin a new chapter in the history of this Maison, which has a rich and unique heritage. I am certain that her energy and talent as well as the wealth of experience she has gained from the greatest Maisons in the Group will be key to the success of the brand’s new global project,"" commented LVMH chairman and CEO Sidney Toledano in a brief release published on Wednesday. The executive travelled to the brand's HQ in Milan specially to introduce the new artistic director. 

The designer's previous experience also includes a five-year stint at Christian Dior Couture, between 2009 and 2014, when she served as creative director for fashion jewellery and creative consultant for leather goods. Prior to this, she took part in the launch of Louis Vuitton's ready-to-wear line under the direction of Marc Jacobs. Outside of the LVMH group, she has held roles at Azzedine Alaïa and at Chanel, where she worked in PR. Born to a French mother and an Italian father, and boasting some 30 years of experience in luxury and fashion, Miceli appears to have all the necessary assets to breathe new life into Emilio Pucci, which has been operating without an artistic director since 2017.

"Sep 1, 2021","September’s Paris Fashion Week will feature a total of 92 houses, as Paul Smith and Raf Simons return, and scores of brands plan physical shows and events, according to the provisional calendar of the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.The nine-day season which runs from Monday, September 27 to Tuesday October 5, will debut with LVMH Prize finalist Kenneth Ize, the exciting new Austro-Nigerian designer, and end with a unique celebration to the late Albert Elbaz, in a show by his fledgling fashion house AZ Factory.
 
In between major global marques such as Christian Dior, Balmain, Hermès, Balenciaga, Givenchy, Chanel, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton will all stage live shows, albeit before reduced audiences.All told, 37 houses are currently listed as planning live runway shows – a major increase in any French season since the pandemic took hold early last year. While 32 plan to hold physical presentations with mixes of videos, still life and live models in by-invitation-only spaces. All digital events will be broadcast on the Federation’s official platform, which was radically updated and modernized in the past several years. 
Considering that last March only two houses actually staged live shows in Paris – Hermès and Coperni – the announcement that almost 40 will stage runway shows in the upcoming season represents a remarkable turnaround for the French season, and very good news for the Federation.
 
The Federation, which governs high fashion in France, stressed in its release that all the houses listed on its calendar must “comply with the recommendations of the public authorities. Health pass will (stet) be mandatory.”
 
Since Monday, the French government made health passes mandatory for some two million workers, covering all staff who work in cafés, cinemas and on public transport, as the government grapples to convince a+ final minority of the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
 
Paris will also welcome two new happening French brands onto the schedule – Botter and Ludovic de Saint Sernin – and also Shang Xia, the Chinese luxury marque, in which Exor, an investment vehicle of Italy’s Agnelli family, acquired control from Hermès last year. 
The season will witness the much-anticipated debut at Rochas of Charles de Vilmorin, the 24-year-old wunderkind who has already staged his own couture collection for his eponymous brand. While great attention will be focused on Ann Demeulemeester, where the founding designer returns to the catwalk, after retiring in 2013. The show will mark Ann’s first collection since the 2020 acquisition of her house by Italian fashion entrepreneur Claudio Antonioli.
 
Other brands returning to Paris, the single most important women’s fashion season on the international calendar, are Agnes B., Lacoste and Ungaro.
 
That said quite a few celebrated major and independent designers will still be absent again – such as Saint Laurent, Celine, Off-White, Alexander McQueen, Sacai, Comme des Garçons and Junya Watanabe.
 
Two American brands that had been showing in New York – Thom Browne and Altuzarra – have returned to the American season, which starts three weeks before Paris.
 
Four young brands will also stage officially sanctioned presentations: Alexandre Blanc and Minuit from France; Didu, a genderless label from China and Lecavalier from Canada.

"Aug 27, 2021","Korean style, as worn by K-pop icons, is having the biggest inspiration on what women are wearing on the streets of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.According to a recent study conducted among users of the Rakuten*-owned Rakuma marketplace application in Japan, Korean fashion is by far the most influential when it comes to the style of Japanese women, from all generations (or nearly), ahead of the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and China. 

The breakdown indicates that more than three quarters of Japanese girls and teenagers aged 10 to 20 (77%) answered Korea to the question ""Which country besides Japan do you reference the most when it comes to fashion?"" Japanese women in their 20s (57%), 30s (36%), 40s (24%), and 60s (22%) also see Korea as a must-have fashion reference. Only those in their 50s place France at the top of the list of most influential countries in terms of style (23.5%), but Korea remains in the top three (21%). Note that for Japanese women aged 10 to 40, it is the United States that gets second place in the ranking.American style is a reference for menFor Japanese men, style references come straight from the United States, and this for all age groups with at least 40% of votes. In second position, is Korean fashion for the youngest, the 10-20 year-olds (29%) and the 20-30 year-olds (14%), while Italian style takes second place for Japanese men aged 30 and more. And when asked to name the most inspiring celebrities when it comes to style, men said Japanese singer Takuya Kimura, then K-pop group BTS, as well as Japanese comedian George Tokoro.

The study looked at the reasons why respondents chose a particular country as a fashion reference. The verdict: Korean fashion is unanimously appreciated by men and women of all age groups because it is accessible and easy to find (65%), while the appeal for American fashion is mainly explained by the fact that it allows Japanese to express their own personalities. Finally, French and Italian brands are deemed trustworthy by Japanese consumers.

* This survey was conducted by Rakuten's ""Rakuma"" nationwide on July 1 and 2, 2021, among a sample of 5,124 users, including 3,896 women and girls and 1,228 men and boys over the age of 10.

Stockholm Fashion Week will in fact open with a conference on sustainability, technology and innovation in fashion, which will be held on the morning of Tuesday 31 at the Six Hotel, in the heart of the Swedish city.
 Stockholm is hoping to overshadow its Copenhagen competitor by showing how Sweden is committed to these issues.

"Aug 25, 2021","H&M Group has announced the return of the Global Change Award “with new scope” as the biggest global innovation challenge to transform the fashion industry opens for applications. The 2022 edition is looking for “early-stage innovations contributing to a planet positive fashion industry by addressing the earth’s global commons: land, water, oceans, climate and biodiversity”. The prize on offer for the winners is a share of a grant of €1 million, provided by the H&M Foundation.

The award has been running since the non-profit H&M Foundation started it in 2015 in collaboration with Accenture and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. And it has attracted more than 20,000 entries since then.But it was paused due to the pandemic, which makes the new edition a big deal both for the Foundation and for the industry.

Recognising that the consumer and the industry have changed for good post-pandemic, H&M said: “We are changing the scope, where we previously recognised ideas that can make the fashion industry circular we are now looking for solutions that address one or several of the global commons to create a planet positive fashion future. The GCA is all about speed, scale and impact and we are now raising the bar and taking a more holistic approach in order for the fashion industry to achieve radical change before 2030 and fulfil the UN Sustainable Development Goals.”

Erik Bang, Innovation Lead at the H&M Foundation, added that “focusing on land, water, oceans, climate and biodiversity will lead to a true shift for the fashion industry, transforming this industry into a planet positive one. With all creative innovations out there ready to scale, there is real hope that the fashion industry can become truly sustainable.”

Five winners will be chosen by a panel of experts and, as well as sharing the grant money, they’ll be able to access the year-long GCA Impact Accelerator. This is designed to “enable accelerated scaling of ideas and brings winners invaluable coaching and support along with a fierce network of brilliant minds and memories for life”.

"Jul 29, 2021","Australia, a country known for punching above its weight in sport, literature, cinema, media, wine and the pursuit of happiness, has tended to underperform when it comes to fashion.
 
One can count on one hand the names of Australian designers which smart people can name at dinner parties in London, New York or Paris. One of the many reasons the remarkable success of Zimmermann is so impressive and remarkable.
 
Founded 30 years ago, Zimmermann began life as a clothes stand in Paddington -- the exuberantly scrappy party zone of inner-city Sydney -- when an energetic design college graduate, Nicky Zimmermann, began selling her ideas at weekend markets.Today, Zimmermann boasts flagship stores in London, New York, Beverly Hills and Paris, a massive following in the great department stores of the world; and wide-ranging product choices on Net-a-Porter and MatchesFashion.
 
But, more importantly than that, Nicky Zimmermann has created a highly distinctive aesthetic; a chic blend of the Lucky Country exuberance of her homeland; marvellously upbeat prints and boldly beautiful beachwear, while retaining something of the cool bohemian aesthetic from the earliest days in Paddington. Zimmermann shows had become must-see events in the New York Fashion Week calendar until the pandemic shattered our world. And, tellingly, nearly all the audience at her shows seemed to be wearing Zimmermann, an acid test of a designer connecting.An inveterate voyager, Nicky hasn’t left Australia since dashing back there in March 2020, as the global lockdown took hold. But the brand has certainly been busy, shooting ebullient show videos and opening new boutiques – satellite stores in Cannes and Forte dei Marmi, on the Tuscan coast. All told, Zimmermann boasts 42 stores worldwide.
 
Like all its stores, Cannes was designed by Don McQualter; its 125-square-meters finished in organic lime wash at 11 rue des États Unis. Kitted out with an artwork collection of risqué collages and sketches, including a 1974 ink drawing from Sydney pop artist, Richard Larter, famous for his nude paintings of his wife Pat, and pieces by Naata Nungurrayi and Gaetano Pesce. 
 
The house also unveiled its latest cruise collection, entitled 'The Postcard', with flouncy dresses, full skirts and voluminous blouses incorporating the artwork of James Northfield, the source of many iconic Australian travel posters of the 30s, 40s and 50s. Three decades after opening, it's still run like a family affair, even if Italian investment vehicle Style Capital acquired a 70% stake in late 2020. Sister Simone, is the company COO, while Nicky’s husband Chris Oliver is the CEO. The house does not release annual figures, though its valuation last year was rumored to be close $250 million.
 
So, we caught up with Nicky – a hyper energetic mum of two teenagers – in a morning zoom from France, as the sun was setting behind her in Sydney harbour.
  
FashionNetwork.com: Why a store in Cannes? And why now?
NZ: The first time I saw our Paris store was one of the most exciting things for me ever – such a beautiful store and position. Being an Australian brand opening in Paris is a dream. But, be it in Paris, New York or Sydney or holiday locations, our girl likes to travel, just like we do. So, we love to have city stores and then open satellite boutiques like in the Hamptons. We have been wholesaling to multi-brand shops and online retailers for decades – so we have fantastic insight where our customer lives and what she shops and where. That gives you a great insight wherever you open. So she is travelling to spots like St Tropez, Cannes and Forte di Marmi, and we open in those places.
 
FN: Do you make stores site-specific, like say in Forte dei Marmi?
NZ: Our design store designer John McQualter has done every single one of our stores. He is a great friend and obviously someone whose work we love. John’s main idea is how to dip into an environment in a slightly more casual way. So in Forte di Marmi we worked with a local ceramic artist to add a local aspect and we brought things we love from Australia – paintings and sculptures.
 
But, of course, it’s really important they have a more relaxed feel like in Cannes. Our stores have to be very acceptable to people and very welcoming and comfortable. There should be a feeling of being relaxed and in a room for families and kids.
 
Retail is how we started. Back in Paddington – a night club area, with strip clubs and bars, when I was a design student in Darlinghurst in the late 80s. It was an area of great creativity and fun; and those early days are still in my head. Driving a van and setting up the stand. I can still set up a store; and am very practical and hands on. Within two years of starting we opened stores – and I loved that connection to our customers.
 
FN: What was your inspiration behind your latest resort collection?
NZ: I really wanted a collection that was about the beautiful memories of amazing holidays in my childhood that were relatively simple and easy and about your family. I was looking at the 1950s, and photos of my parents; and artists who did Australian tourism photos. James Northfield’s main body of work were amazingly simple, gorgeous holiday colour posters with a great retro feel. The best holiday is not always the most luxurious – it’s more about creating beautiful memories. 
 
FN: Where and when will you next stage a show?
NZ: That’s a very tricky question. At the moment, I am really enjoying filming our shows. We have incredible show and production teams working here and a very talented film crew. I am working on a September show and going forward – but we don’t know what will be possible. We plan to film and release it during New York Fashion Week, but we are not even sure if we can film it. Our crew often grows up to 80 people, which may not be allowed. And I can not get models from other countries – only girls from New South Wales!

Yet, we get incredible assets from the film – photos and more time to sculpt the show. At a live show you have two hours for hair and makeup and 30 minutes for the look book. Videos are almost more creative – as they leave options open.
 
FN: For a brand so influenced by travel, when did you last leave Australia?
NZ: Not since I flew home from the UK in March 2020, with my husband Chris, our CEO. We were meant to go to Milan and then had to cut the trip short as the global lockdown happened. In 20 years I have not been in Australia for longer two months. We love travelling!
We always fly out each winter.
 
FN: Define the DNA of Zimmermann?
FN: I love to create things that make people feel good at family functions, weddings, celebrations or christenings. It’s about creating memories. 
 
FN: Why are you so obsessed with guipure? That’s a haute couture material par excellence.
NZ: I love craftsmanship – and I feel like I can make anything. I began by sitting in front of the TV as a very young person and making things. So, as a designer it is impossible for me to be minimal. And my team has the same mind set – making fabric flowers and hand stitching. We love to have the personal touch. Things flying off the dresses when the girls walk. I love movement – and fabrics that enable that. 
 
FN: A decade ago I went to one of your shows in Australia when all the lights went out. Since then you have grown on to become a very influential brand and a rapidly growing business. Why do you think you have been so successful internationally while Oz brands have struggled?
NZ: That was our second last show in Australia – the lights went in the whole city grid – just before the show began! The girls were all in their lineup, but we resisted the suggestion to send them out with torches and when the lights all came back on things worked out in the end.
I think there are a couple of reasons things have worked for Zimmermann. I have had the benefit of working with my sister Simone from the very beginnings. She doesn’t want to be a designer. She gets things done and is an amazing COO – extremely organized and runs HR and production and does a mammoth job. Which means I don’t have to do it and am not good at that. She loves clothes but doesn’t want to do that – which makes an amazing balance, so I could not live without her. That rarely happens – and as sisters we have an amazing bond. Plus, my husband - a lawyer – joined 15 years ago, and added another skill set. We do have outside investors – but run it as a family – and that has helped us get over issues that others didn’t. I’m not saying that other Australians don’t work hard but I work incredibly hard – and have had to be resilient. It’s a tough business and we are very ambitious, and you need to be.
 
And I believe we can achieve a lot more. We are who we are and sometimes Australians find it hard to map out who they are. We get it from our parents and environment. We came from Southern beaches – from Cronulla – a very surfy town. Today I live in Vaucluse (Sydney’s poshest inner-city suburb, eds). From the Southern beaches to the Harbour beaches, so it’s a little different.
And, we don’t look to other brands for who we are. Now there is a new local generation finding their voice. Even if Australia is not fashion historically – more surf and fun 
 
FN: Who are you three favourite designers?
NZ: I am a beach shopper – I just love clothes, so I might like a tailored piece from YSL, and I love the sense of fun of Gucci. But it would be hard for me to buy a dress.
 
FN: Where do you want Zimmermann to be in five or ten years?
NZ: Very much steadily on the path we are on now. Lots of stores openings – as I really really love having retail spaces. Yes, our online business is growing hugely but having stores in amazing places – like in Spain or China - to me is incredible. And we have them all mapped out!
 
FN: Though you are stuck in Oz, why did you have a dinner last weekend in the Hamptons?
NZ: I try not to think about that part of paying for it. The great thing is that we have been going to New York for a long time, almost 20 years of building relationships. So, the people at the party I’ve known for that amount time. They started out at a similar stage, whether editors, actors and actresses. People we work with a lot and they know it will be relaxed, warm, fun and comfortable. That’s the whole point of Zimmermann.
 
FN: Might you one day show in Paris?
NZ: We’d love to show in Paris and we make fairly organic decisions. But I would feel pretty intimidated coming to show in Paris, even if it is one of my favourite cities in the world. But I would never say never to anything!Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 28, 2021","Female athletes have fought long and hard for the right to choose what they wear when they compete at the Olympics, and at the Tokyo Games more and more athletes and fans are speaking out and taking action.Of the more than 30 women who played badminton on Wednesday, including India's PV Sindhu and Taiwan's Tai Tzu Ying, about two-thirds wore shorts, while others were clad in skorts, dresses and skirts, and one wore a hijab.

""I'm lucky that we can wear whatever we want,"" said Sindhu, the Rio Olympics women's singles silver medalist who wore one of her blue dresses when she defeated Hong Kong's Cheung Ngan Yi 21-9, 21-16.Iran's Soraya Aghaei Hajiagha, along with her coach, wore a dress, leggings and a hijab in her match with China's He Bing Jiao. Skirts and skorts - loose-fitting shorts that look like skirts from the front - were also a popular choice among players including Belgium's Lianne Tan and Japan's Nozomi Okuhara.

On Sunday, the German women's gymnastics team wore full-body suits in qualifications, hoping to promote freedom of choice and encourage women to wear what makes them feel comfortable.

But the Norwegian women's beach handball team were fined 1,500 euros last week for wearing shorts rather than bikini bottoms and jeopardizing ""the ideal presentation of the sport"", according to the European Handball Federation and the International Handball Federation.

Rules state that the bikini bottoms must be a maximum width of 10 centimetres and have a ""close fit and cut on an upward angle.""

About a decade ago, ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, some officials at the Badminton World Federation (BWF) drew fire because of similar rule saying women had to wear skirts to make the sport more ""feminine"" and ""attractive"" to fans and sponsors. That rule was scrapped prior to the Games, however.

""In hindsight, we went around the wrong way, but we've learned from that and so have our manufacturers,"" said Nora Perry, two-time world champion and a council member of the BWF, whose suppliers include Adidas and Yonex.

""Yonex have embraced it because there are a lot of Koreans and Chinese girls who don't want to wear skirts.""

Perry, who has over 75 international titles in individual competition, said that when she played in the 80s, the fashion was to wear skirts and dresses with ""frilly things underneath"".

""It was nice that the women's voices were heard on that,"" British player Kirsty Gilmour said, ""I personally don't feel comfortable in a skirt so I like the choice of short shorts, long shorts; Tai Tzu Ying likes her tops sleeveless.""

"Jul 28, 2021","AZ Factory, the fledgling fashion house founded by Alber Elbaz, will stage a special homage show to the late designer that will to close out this autumn’s Paris Fashion Week. 
“The show, entitled Love Brings Love, will be held October 5th, 2021 at 8pm CET and will pay tribute to Alber’s creative vision and his extraordinary love for the fashion family,” the house said in a release on Wednesday.
 
The next Paris women’s ready-to-wear season is due to be staged from Monday, September 27 to Tuesday, October 5.One of the most outstanding designers of the past quarter century, Elbaz died of complications caused by Covid-19 in Paris on April 24, 2021.
 
His death came just three months after Elbaz had launched AZ Factory as a “democratic brand” in January 2021, backed by the giant luxury group Richemont.
 
The debut collection featured Elbaz's signature cocktail-hour sophistication, superlative draping and ability to enhance feminine beauty with exotic finishes, which characterized his designs at Lanvin, where he was creative director for 15 years. However, unlike the luxury marque Lanvin, AZ Factory featured a price point targeted at a far wider demographic audience, while still containing the essential DNA of Elbaz.
 
Elbaz also broke rules with his launch, staging what he called “show fashion” - a mock variety TV show with mid-range price clothes. Somewhat ironically, the collection was launched during the haute couture season, which dresses the world’s richest women. 
“Haute couture stands for experimenting and individuality so I feel we are right to be in couture,” said Elbaz at the time. 
 
The debut collection featured eco-dyed, nylon microfiber traditionally used in active wear, as AZ Factory employed innovative, 3D knitting technology to create woven details inspired by couture craftsmanship.
 
Named AZ Factory after the first and last letters of his name, Elbaz’s project was an intensely personal voyage for one of the most loved individuals in fashion.
 
In the immediate aftermath of his passing, there was speculation that Richemont might closed down the infant house. However, in June, AZ Factory launched two new product stories.
 
The first of the new stories, SuperTech-SuperChic, became available on June 12 to mark the founder’s 60th birthday. While the second, Free To, started retailing online shortly after.

At the time, the house first revealed plans to honor the late designer during the womenswear spring/ summer 2022 in Paris.
 
“The event will celebrate the extraordinary life and work of the brand’s founder, paying tribute to his creative vision and joyous spirit,” AZ Factory said in June.

"Jul 28, 2021","The British Fashion Council has released its annual report for 2020/21 in which it shared some of the achievements of what was one of the most challenging years ever.But it also said that it saw an almost-50% fall in revenue in the 12 months to the end of March, although it managed to donate the same amount to charity in 2020 as it did in 2019.

The body’s Chair, Stephanie Phair said: “On the topic of charitable giving, the BFC delivered positive impact this year through setting ambitious fundraising targets to support designer businesses and students through the BFC Foundation Covid Fashion Fund, raising and disbursing over £1.5 million”.CEO Caroline Rush also said that in “a year that can be compared to no other in our lifetimes to date, we have all learned to be more resolute, agile and creative. During this time, not only has the BFC network come together, but it has grown 20%. The global positioning of London as a leader in innovation and responsible business and the role of the British fashion industry for creativity have been permanently secured”.

The organisation has made a big impact over the year with events like digital London Fashion Weeks, the first Institute of Positive Fashion Forum, its ongoing awards programmes, business support for British designers and more.

Rush added that it “used its convening power to galvanise the industry into action to support talent throughout this past year. We engaged with Government to work on the immediate challenges of the pandemic, from furlough to Covid-19 Business Interruption Loans, to gaining support for Covid-safe LFW and continue to ask for talent quarantine exemptions”.

But it has also been focused on dealing with the challenges of Brexit and the ending of the decades-long status quo as far as luxury tax-free sales in British stores are concerned.

Its lobbying around the VAT Retail Export Scheme hasn’t changed the Government’s mind so far, but its campaigning for visas for paid engagements in EU countries has had a beneficial outcome.

The BFC said its objectives for 2021/22 include a big focus on sustainability and diversity with an aim to “enable positive growth, support creative excellence and accelerate change through the Institute of Positive Fashion to meet Government targets of net zero”.

Clearly, it also hopes that its funding position will become stronger this year and a look at the figures for the last 12 months shows just how big the funding gap was. In the year ending March 31 2020 it had total income, including Government grants, of £11.869 million. In the year ending March 2021, that income was £6.168 million. That's a big drop, although careful management meant that the group still had a surplus for the financial year (of £736,000, which wasn't that far short of the £973,000 surplus of the previous year). 

Government funding made up 34% of its total revenue in the latest year compared to 24% in the previous 12 months but commercial partnerships such as those with Swarovski, Clearpay and more were also crucial.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 27, 2021","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), in collaboration with global event organizer IMG, has unveiled the schedule for this September’s New York Fashion Week, revealing a five-day program of in-person shows and presentations from 91 national and international brands showcasing their collections for Spring/Summer 2022. 
Set to run Wednesday, September 8 through Sunday, September 12, the event signals the return of a more complete calendar of physical shows, following two seasons which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, were predominantly digital affairs.
 
The calendar kicks off with a show from Ulla Johnson on September 8 and draws to a close with Tom Ford. Among the other homegrown talents hitting the NY runway this fall, the CFDA was keen to highlight the return of Thom Browne, who has been showing his womenswear in Paris since 2017. Altuzarra, which made the move to the French capital’s fashion week in the same year, will also be making its New York come-back this season, with a show scheduled for September 12.The label’s return is part of the wider Fashion Alliance initiative, which has seen 11 U.S. brands commit to showing at IMG’s NYFW: The Shows for the next three seasons. Aside from Altuzarra, other Alliance members include Telfar, Rodarte, Proenza Schouler, Altuzarra, Brandon Maxwell, Prabal Gurung, Sergio Hudson, Monse, Jason Wu, LaQuan Smith and Markarian.
 
As previously reported, NYFW regular Michael Kors will be hosting a show on the morning of September 10, with the label promising a multi-layered digital experience to complement the live runway event. Carolina Herrera, on the other hand, has chosen September 9 for its 40th anniversary show, while Rachel Comey will be celebrating 20 years in business with its own anniversary runway presentation two days later.
 
Certain national heavy weights are, however, conspicuously absent from the official NYFW calendar for this September as it currently stands, including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Thankfully, these absences are somewhat compensated for by the presence of a handful of star international brands on the calendar, with Moschino set to show on September 9, while Dundas will take to the catwalk the day before.
 
Beyond the five-day fashion week proper, the CFDA is also continuing its American Collections Calendar, which includes U.S. brands who are showing outside of the official NYFW schedule, or even in other countries. In September, this extended calendar features Christian Siriano and Harlem’s Fashion Row, both of whom will be showing on Tuesday, September 7.
 
“New York Fashion Week is back with a diverse lineup representative of the future of American fashion,” said CFDA CEO Steven Kolb in a release. “Our fashion industry has come together as we continue to emerge from the pandemic, and a collaborative spirit is paramount to the success of our creative talents. Working in tandem with IMG has enabled us to present a singular Official New York Fashion Week Schedule of shows and presentations within the American Collections Calendar.” 
Although brands will be returning to the physical catwalk this season, their collections will also continue to be presented via the CFDA’s Runway360 digital platform, which was launched last year in order to respond to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and facilitate the hosting of a virtual fashion week.
 
The platform is designed to be a permanent “one-stop-shop” for information and resources about brands’ collections throughout the year, and supports a range of tools, including AR/VR, 360-degree capabilities, live video streams, e-commerce extensions, consumer shopping features and social media integrations.
 
Fashion week organizers and brands alike may be eager to get back to business as usual this season, but it looks like some of the innovations developed and explored over the last year are here to stay.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 26, 2021","Members of Team Canada at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony stepped out on Friday as part of the Parade of Nation’s unveiling the official Opening Ceremony uniform, designed by Hudson’s Bay. The 26-piece Team Canada kit collection includes full outfits for the Opening and Closing ceremonies, Podium Presentations and village wear, which will be on display throughout the Olympics. 

The collection was designed with performance, comfort and bold artistic motifs that pay tribute to the street style aesthetic from Japan, and modern Canadian-cool style, though certain spray-painted denim pieces were labelled as questionable among critics. Each Team Canada athlete received a complete clothing kit consisting of jackets, t-shirts, tank tops, lightweight track pants and shorts, tailored denim, baseball and bucket hats, and other accessories including a hip pack, sweatbands, a backpack, and luggage, including several apparel items provided by Levi’s.

“The Opening Ceremony sets the stage for Canadian athletes as they embark on their journey to gold and as the Official Outfitter of Team Canada, we’ve designed a uniform that ignites a strong and unapologetic sense of Canadian pride for both athletes competing and for everyone cheering them on from back home,” said Iain Nairn president and CEO of Hudson’s Bay. 

“We are rallying behind Team Canada and wish every athlete the best of luck as competitions commence.”

Canadians can also sport the Olympic replica collection pieces available exclusively at Hudson’s Bay. 

Fashion is indeed centre stage at the Olympics with many team uniforms stamped with a designer seal of approval. Ralph Lauren once again designed for Team USA, while Kim Kardashian’s brand Skims is the official provider of athletic undergarments.

"Jul 12, 2021","The Musée des Arts Décoratifs (MAD) of the Louvre is to stage a major retrospective of the career and creativity of Thierry Mugler, which will debut in September.Entitled Thierry Mugler: Couturissime, the exhibition is designed to pay homage to a unique multidisciplinary artist, whose ideas influenced fashion, photography, video music culture, perfumery and gay rights.
 
Created not as classic retrospective, Thierry Mugler: Couturissime will also highlight the historic collaborations between Thierry Mugler and his creative alter-ego Manfred.  Scheduled to open on September 30, 2021 until April 24, 2022, the exhibition was initiated, produced and circulated by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) in 2019.  
Thierry Mugler: Couturissime will be staged inside the newly renovated Christine and Stephen A. Schwarzman Fashion Galleries of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. 
 
From the 1970s until 2002 when Mugler retired as an active runway designer, the creator established himself as one of the most daring and innovative couturiersof his time, creating a dramatic power-shouldered look that defined the silhouette of the '80s.
 
He was one of the first European designers to appreciate the power and reach of MTV culture. And his collaboration with George Michael in the 1992 video Too Funky, featuring only Mugler clothes, is a defining moment in establishing couture as a global phenomena and not just a pampered clothing cult reserved to a few thousand billionaires' wives. While the metallic robot leotard with rear-view mirrors he designed for Emma Sjoberg remains an iconic fashion image. His path-breaking inclusion of transgender models in his legendary 1990s shows in Paris also played a not-insignificant role in the growing acceptance of non-binary sexual diversity.
 
The exhibition – to be displayed over two floors - will also will mark the return of Mugler to Paris, where his fame began nearly five decades ago.  
From ready-to-wear and haute couture silhouettes to stage costumes, photographs and unpublished archives dating from 1973 to 2014, Thierry Mugler: Couturissime will showcase the universe of this creator and his multiple collaborations in the fields of entertainment, music and cinema. 
 
Curated by Thierry-Maxime Loriot, a collective scenography with the MMFA will include digital performances by entertainment and audiovisual professionals. 
 
One room will be dedicated to the photography, since Mugler, in 1976, became one of the first designers to begin photographing his campaigns. Shooting his “Glamazons” like Jerry Hall or Iman, in exotic locations such as Greenland; Moscow’s Seven Sisters skyscrapers; the Sahara Desert, and the rooftop of the Paris Opera House.

"Jul 12, 2021","Stockholm Fashion Week has unveiled plans for what it calls a “new normal” runway season, due to be staged from August 31 to September 2. 
Organizers have revealed that the three-day season will be a blend of physical events, pre-recorded shows, digital films and live presentations. With the goal to stage allow a free and democratic format that allows for a variety of show disciplines, though with physical events playing a key role. 
 
“Fashion week has had to adapt, just like the industry and the entire world, change and open up to better fulfil current needs. I believe that it is particularly important to encourage creativity and the magic of fashion right now when we all finally come out of lockdown. Basic and season-less is great, but we are all eager dress up again and to meet, digitally or better still - in real life,” said Catarina Midby, secretary general at the Swedish Fashion Association, which organizes Stockholm Fashion Week. This time a year ago, Stockholm Fashion Week was put on hold due the Covid-19 crisis, though the event was able to return in a mixed, largely digital format in February. 
Midby is predicting a noteworthy lineup of brands including leather specialist Stand Studio; BLK DNM, founded by Johan Lindeberg a decade ago; sartorial streetwear label Diemonde; and Asket, known for its timeless classic philosophy. While the Swedish capital will also be buzzing with exhibitions, installations, performances and sundry inspirational fashion experiences. 
 
In addition, Stockholm plans to host a number of intimate “Studio Visits,” meetings with the designers in their own creative space. 
 
Once again, the Swedish season will be a “hybrid format” around five different disciplines, starting with Fashion Future, a half-day conference on fashion, sustainability, technology and innovation. Most talks and panel discussions with international speakers will be digital but presented live in Stockholm with the opportunity for networking and collaborations. The city will also be the site of a Sustainable Fashion Hub, for circular brands operating with new sustainable business models; open to both press and the public. With elements of cool fashion rental; deluxe vintage and second-hand companies. 
 
The season will also support the new generation with a Swedish Fashion Talents projects; and host final-year students’ graduation collections shows from Beckmans College of Design and the Swedish School of Textiles. 
 
“The new fashion week format, with a diversity of expressions and participants, feels new and exciting. The fashion community and fashion week needed to rethink and reset and it’s important for brands to reach out through an international platform like Stockholm Fashion Week,” added Diemonde founder Angelo da Silveira in a release.
 
Swedish fashion is a significant element in the overall national economy, representing some 11% of all Swedish exports in 2020 with revenues of 272 billion krona, or some 26 billion euros.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 7, 2021","Paris couture is not just about giant global brands dressing the world’s most pampered billionaires’ wives. It’s also about rampant experimentation, and fashionable irony, as seen in three collections unveiled Tuesday: Alexandre Vauthier, Viktor & Rolf and Ronald van der Kemp.
 Alexander Vauthier: A Tale of Two Cities 
“A little darkness reflects this moment, don’t you think,” comments Paris couturier Alexander Vauthier, who sent his entire collection to London to be shot by Alasdair McLellan.
 
The East London photographer shot both the look-book and Vauthier’s kicky and scratchy show video, allying UK grit to his Gallic glamour. 
In the end, almost all Alexandre’s fall/winter 2021 collection was almost all in black, with dashes of crystals and silver, his response to this somber summer of never-ending pandemic.
 
Dark, yet dashing, and even diabolical; from the majestic leather jacket sculpted like orchids, to the décolleté black crepe jersey screen goddess dress.And unquestionably couture with all the special workmanship that implies. Like the amazing glove leather leopard/jackets dusted in small showers of crystal courtesy of some brilliant embroidery by Lesage. Or the negligee dress in stalactites and shards of crystals, in another great performance again by Lesage.
 
Arguably Vauthier’s most impressive look was a sequinned dress worthy of only the best nightclubs, with a marvellously dense feather trim, courtesy of feather specialist Lemarié, which like Lesage is part of the Chanel group’s Paraffection, which has recently opened a mammoth new centre called 19M in northeast Paris, grouping over a dozen expert couture suppliers.
 
Indeed, the whole current season seemed to have been touched by 19M, with the likes of Maria Grazia Chiuri of Christian Dior praising the centre to the heavens.
 
Asked about it, Vauthier responded: “I love 19M. To be honest, to complete this collection I went there once a week, and each time I felt like I had witnessed a miracle,” he confessed.Viktor & Rolf: Nostalgia Royal 
Though they refused to reveal whether they are monarchists or not, Viktor & Rolf  are clearly obsessed with royalty, albeit with supersized doses of irony.
 
So much so that every single look in their latest couture collection took the mickey out of the nobility. The result was Henry VIII meets Danny La Rue, or Honey Dijon goes on a date with Prince Charles.  
“There’s been quite a lot of upheaval about the monarchy recently. That made us think how similar royalty is to the fashion system. Which has its kings and queens; its hierarchy; and its need for the show to go on, no matter what happens backstage. Which made us think of the concept of fakeness, versus real,” explained a pale Rolf Snoeren. 
 
Using royal fabrics, again with a twist, like patchwork dead stock brocade and jacquard, or fake biodegradable day-glow furs made out of raffia strips; or faux gemstones to create arty, ersatz versions of royal ceremonial garments.
 
Their inspirations were also Disney queens, seen in the fake pearl crowns and Perspex tiara. While sashes were full of pithy sayings like: 'Don’t be a Drag, just be a Queen'; 'Royal Pain in the Ass' or 'Princess? No bitch, Queen!'
 
Ironically, the duo had actually been knighted in their native Holland in October 2018, under the Order of the Netherlands Lion, a Dutch royal recognition of merit for those in the arts, science, sport and literature.
 
A dozen royal looks on stockmen were presented in a tableau within the neo-classical Expiatory Chapel, a commemorative monument, built on the spot where the bones of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were eventually buried.
 
Where they royalists? 
 
“I think the message of this collection is that everyone believes in Monarchy. And, this is where Marie Antoinette ended up, and I think it’s a truly beautiful place,” demurred Viktor Horsting.
 Ronald van der Kemp’s Vaccines for the Mind 
One voice in fashion always worth hearing is Ronald van der Kemp, the ever iconoclastic Dutch couturier, whose latest collection is named 'The Mind Vaccine'.
 “It’s fashion equivalent of ethical designer drugs. People talk about diversity and I talk about bio-diversity. Fashion cannot keep producing lots of collections people don’t need. So we work with leftovers,” insisted Ronald, who presented his collection in person by rendezvous in the Dutch Embassy on Rue de Grenelle.
 
A mock surgical syringe full of blood perched on a stand greeted visitors to the elegant mansion. A bold, gothic gown was laid down on the first half-dozen steps of the embassy’s red-carpeted stairs.
 
An acknowledged master of upcycling even before the term was invented, van der Kemp sources from the unused high-level stocks of major Paris houses or provincial textile specialists.
 
One archive of beautifully coloured mousseline was turned into a fantastic patchwork bustier; while yards of golden raffia became a great full skirt topped by multiple chains.
 
Though born in southern Netherlands, his headquarters are in Amsterdam, near the flower market on the city’s large canal, the Singel. He cut his design teeth in New York, working for the great Bill Blass, before returning to Europe, where these days he fully concentrates on couture, with large doses of pointed irony.
 
A manifesto beside the syringe reads: “Get ready for responsible hedonism.”
 
Ronald also bonded dead stock floral mousseline, cutting and gluing it into a marvellous sylvan jacket that looked grown organically. While a series of old denim jeans were ripped into tiny strips and reborn as a “fake fur” shaggy jacket with lace inserts.
 
“Ban fake fur, I say, and not just the real thing. I respect designers who take an ecological stand, but quite frankly fake fur is made of plastic and far worse for the environment that the real thing,” argued van der Kemp.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 5, 2021","Azzedine Alaïa was never, ever going to be an easy act to follow, but with an elite audience perched on wooden folding chairs on the street outside the house’s historic headquarters willing him on – Pieter Mulier unveiled a striking and sculptural debut collection, winning himself a well-deserved standing ovation. 
Mulier was highly respectful of the brand’s DNA throughout, without however following it to slavishly. He played with multiple Alaïa references – stretch crepe; perforated leather; sculpted cocktails; Amazonia leggings or Venetian blind columns but gave them all his own twist.
 
His body-con stretched cocktails finished with matching skull caps were all pretty sensational; while his stretch wool flamenco dresses finished below the knee with feathers were brilliant.Alaïa never designed for a shrinking violet or hot-house flower, and neither does Mulier. Like Azzedine, Mulier’s cast marched like empowered heroines. From the quartet of beauties who smoldered down the street in body-caressing semi-sheer columns; to the artfully constructed waistcoats that finished in cowls, Grace-Jones style; to the racy denim jumpsuit with shawl collar; to the great screen-goddess feathered coats.
 
Moreover, Mulier also mingled in some great accessories – from the giant rawhide leather totes with woven leather trim; or cool half-moon shoulder bags. 
Though known as a great friend of supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon, Linda Evangelista or Naomi Campbell, who opened Alaïa’s final show, in fact the majority of Azzedine’s casts in later years were obscure locals, or women of character he admired.
 
Mulier, by contrast, used a pricey, top-notch crew – from Mica Argañaraz and Rianne Von Rompaey to Liya Kebede and Natasha Poly. Clearly the house’s owner, luxury conglomerate Richemont, and Alaïa’s composed and elegant CEO Myriam Serrano, have the budget to back Mulier’s vision.
 
Somewhat eccentrically, the cast entered the runway by walking along a chained-off sidewalk for the first 50 yards, before turning onto the 100-meter long catwalk on rue de Moussy, in the heart of the Marais. 
 
Another flaw was the irritating lighting, which meant most of the audience saw the models back-lit; not exactly wise in our Instagram era. Curiously, French fashion’s best lighting director, Thierry Dreyfus, was sitting front-row, though as a fan, not as show producer. His skills were missed. 
But these are small quibbles about a consummately skillful display by Mulier. The show marked the Belgian-born designer’s historic debut as a fully fledged creative director. In a notable career he had been the right-hand man of Raf Simons in Milan, Paris and New York – at Jil Sander, Christian Dior and Calvin Klein, respectively.
 
Not everything he did quite jelled – like the aubergine-hued ruffled crepe mini cocktail that was too twee; as were the stretch biker shorts worn with metallic tops, or the studded heeled clogs. 
 
Yet the unsaid question, before any model appeared, was: could Mulier cut it as a number one? On this evidence, he should have a very successful career at the house, while fully respecting the founder’s oeuvre.
 Pre-show, Mulier left a letter on each guest’s seat extolling Azzedine: “for your peerless adulation of the feminine figure. You were sculptor, a genius of the hand. Your fashion had a heart and a rare intelligence – a combination of precision, modernity and poetry.”
 
Asked how he felt after his debut, Mulier responded: “Happy and relieved. And very glad that everyone saw the letter. I wanted to underline the basis of the respect I have for this unique house and unique designer.” 
 
At the finale, Mulier garnered a huge burst of applause from a front row that included many old friends of the house – from architectural great Jean Nouvel, to LVMH’s Sidney Toledano to Valentino’s Pier Paolo Piccioli.
 
“Magnifique! I think Azzedine would have enjoyed this collection very much. And I did too, as I know that with Pieter designing Alaïa the house’s future is bright,” enthused Christoph Von Weyhe, Alaïa’s long-time partner.
 
Von Weyhe revealed to FashionNetwork.com that Mulier had invited him to visit and check out the progress of the collection, though he demurred. “I told Peter I wanted to see the full statement. And, I’m glad I waited,” Von Weyhe winked.

"Jul 5, 2021","We’ll say this much for Virgil Abloh and Off-White, he sure knows how to put on a good show. Like his latest catwalk event on Sunday afternoon in Paris, with M.I.A. performing a live mini-concert at the finale, and a hoard of current and vintage supermodels parading his latest designs. Entitled 'Laboratory of Fun,' Abloh revealed his most tailored and soigné collection to date, perhaps the end result of a move upmarket.
 
This week, Chicago-born Virgil opened up a new Paris flagship on rue Castiglione, named after the famed author of The Courtier, that knowing tale of an ambitious provincial in the world of royal affairs. And the store is located barely 50 meters from a royal standard of luxury – Louis Vuitton, where Abloh has his night job as creative director of menswear.Bella Hadid opened and closed the show, in the exact same electric take on Yves Klein Infinity Blue. The opener was a micro velour cocktail completed with faintly marbleized knee-high boots and big gold-cluster costume jewelry. The finale was less happy; the same velvet cut into a flamenco gown with added tire-like hips and bosom. If Bella has rarely looked happier in her opening passage, she clearly grimaced pulling up the finale, the better to make her turn before the almost farcically small photographers' pit. 
Out next came the 1990s' greatest indie model, veteran Amber Valletta, with her signature walk, a from-the-shoulders-down strut. Weaving between a series of great plywood-speaker columns worthy of Charles René Macintosh in a stone-blue, ironed-leather suit, and a blazer with off-center buttons. Prussian blue cool-wool suits topped with check cloches or ecru leather versions looked all tastefully haute bourgeois, though the designer did change gear for evening – with a trio of gowns nipped and extended along the sides. Art-gallery-opening gear par excellence.
 
“The collection speaks in part to my roots as an architect,” stressed Abloh in his program notes.
 
His big styling trick was a series of politely diabolical miniature corsets with fabric horns, but worn around the head as a mask and not on any torso. 
In a co-ed show, Abloh also cut some very natty orange nylon blazers; oversized matelassé sleeveless puffers; and a series of voluminous loon pants – playing with perforations and extended back shapes throughout. 
 
At the finale, guests practically wrestled for a copy of the invitation – a lime-colored Perspex square with the brand’s name stenciled out. And there was a sense of stenciled shapes this collection. All told, this was Abloh’s most tailored and traditionalist display, devoid of any DJ T-shirts and with limited doses of street-wear. And yet, as an ensemble it all felt very now, very assured. 
 
Virgil was so confident, he strolled about greeting guests before the show. Like all his guests, wearing a mask. And then led out his cast for a final walkabout, ending up on stage, high-fiving M.I.A. as she went through a full-blooded version of her iconic hit 'Paper Planes.'
 
Most definitely a fun laboratory.

"Jul 4, 2021","A moment of restrained escapism at AMI, with founder designer Alexandre Mattiussi creating a collection for a world finally emerging from Covid tentatively.
 
Shot with joy, though not melodramatic excitement, inside a fun fair AMI hired just for the shoot, the show video of the spring/summer 2022 collection was unveiled on Saturday, July 3. It marked the latest unusual date as the European catwalk season continues to be a fragmented series of one-off events, and fell just two days before Paris begins its four-day haute-couture season. 
“We are living a moment between two worlds. The world of Covid restrictions and isolation, and a new one with hope and energy where we want to gather together. As we are coming back to normal life, let’s celebrate it with beauty, poetry, romanticism, sexiness, sensuality, hair and boobs!” explained Mattiussi, who named the video, 'L'Échappée Belle', a French phrase meaning you risked danger but survived, like a prey escaping the hunter.
 
Though there is nothing tentative about the performance of his brand, which is quite probably the fastest growing indie runway brand in Paris, or Europe, in many years.
 
Backed up by a well-organized back office and Mattiussi’s own canny blend of French cool and commercial savvy, AMI is enjoying truly explosive growth. In the past financial year, ending on March 31, AMI doubled its revenues to 68 million euros, as the brand went into overdrive on the web.

Even as we met with Mattiussi for a preview on Friday inside a showroom on Rue Cassette in Paris's Saint-Germain, a score of backstage staff were busy photographing and cataloging the collection – some 750 references to be ready to start selling directly on Monday.
 
For next season, Mattiussi would like to see young ladies in slinky, body-stocking like robes, sleeveless sequined columns, or in flirty chiffon cocktails – ideal for a terrace cocktail, or even a red carpet moment at Cannes. Mattiussi has set up a suite at the film festival, which starts next week, and plans to attend European cinema’s most fashionable moment there, the annual AmfAR dinner.
 
In more casual moods, AMI gals will wear oversized spencers and cropped tuxedos; or voluminous boyfriends’ blazers in sturdy wool gabardine. 
 
As did his guys in his co-ed video, though pairing them with great tie-dye shorts and pants; the material dyed in Paris, but the garments assembled in Portugal. Each tie-dye hand-made, so no two looks the same, as his youthful cast dashed about the fair ground or jumping on dodgems.  
“We spent lockdown looking at images of empty cities – Paris, Venice or New York. So, I wanted come back but not crazily,” added the designer.
 
In January, Chinese investor vehicle Sequoia acquired a majority stake in AMI. That in part helped to fund rapid expansion, though AMI’s cash flow is so strong, most boutique openings are financed internally.
 
The brand will open a New York flagship in November, and has now 10 stores in China. On Friday, Alexandre even opened AMI men and women pop-ups in Galeries Lafayette, and hung his iconic heart over an A logo inside the department store’s famed Art Deco cupola.
 
“We are the first brand in the history of Galeries Lafayette to be hung inside the department store’s cupola. And their cupola is the most visited place in France after the Eiffel Tower,” chuckled the bearded and bright eyed Alexandre, who still rides around Paris on his scooter from the new home he is renovating in the haute bohemian 20th arrondissement.
 
His heart logo aertexes are now ubiquitous among cool Parisians, as are his soft AMI Paris sweat-shirts. His spring/summer 2022 accessories also looked powerful: great new sneakers with mountaineers ropes and not laces. Floppy felt cloches made by Borsalino.
 
Buoyant, bouncy and upbeat like his collection, Mattiussi has hit the sweet sport many designers just dream about.
 
“I work a long day, every day. But I was alone in an apartment 10 years ago when I started AMI, and now I have almost 200 people working for me. That makes me proud,” he concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 2, 2021","On Thursday, South African designer Thebe Magugu, LVMH Prize winner in 2019, unveiled his first menswear collection at the Florentine show he is a special guest of this season, his half-ranger, half-cow-boy style at once elegant and socially engaged.With the collection, and taking advantage of the visibility Pitti Uomo offers, Magugu has chosen to speak out against the corruption that is rife in Africa, and in the world as a whole, poisoning the economy and social life at all levels. Magugu staged an unusual performance, in which 12 of his models played the part of the corrupt, and were interrogated one by one under the stern eye of three ranger-like characters in tartan suits, tall hats and trench coats.

As the audience exited, they were given a magazine produced by Magugu with 20 South African journalists who have been vocal in denouncing corruption. Magugu drew his inspiration for the collection from the book ‘The Whistleblowers’ by Mandy Wiener, and from illustrator Jonathan Zapiro’s drawings, whose motifs were printed on cotton blouses and trousers. One of the stand-out items was the trench coat with bloodied hand-prints dripping down on the pockets.The collection features altogether 15 highly charged total looks in gaucho/cow-boy style, with boots made in Italy and wide-brimmed hats made in wool felt by South African milliner Crystal Birch. “[The collection] is inspired chiefly by the world of westerns, pitting the good guys against the bad. Compared to ready-to-wear, menswear is really something else in terms of proportions and construction. Until now, I’ve only ever designed the occasional look, but more and more men have been buying my women’s clothes, so I started thinking about a fully fledged line,” Magugu told FashionNetwork.com backstage.The wardrobe features clothes made mostly in wool, printed cotton and knitwear. Some tunic-tops are knitted in the same hues and patterns as the trousers. A red and grey checked stole matching the suit envelops one model’s upper body, like a gaucho’s poncho. A pair of orange cotton trousers match a shirt with pockets whose flaps drop down on the thighs, like cow-boys’ chaps. The same detail is featured over a pair of shorts.

Success doesn’t seem to have blunted 27-year-old Magugu's edge. He showed once more a complete mastery of the craft, from designing and creating clothes – that are made entirely in South Africa - to developing fabrics, with an ability to showcase his country's creative talents.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 2, 2021","The British Fashion Council (BFC) has released a provisional line-up for London Fashion Week (17-21 September) with headliners including Victoria Beckham, Erdem, and JW Anderson among the 100-plus confirmed designers. More names will be added over the next few weeks, the BFC said.Presented as a physical-digital hybrid, a provisional schedule will be released in mid-July with specific information regarding the format of each showcase (physical, digital or both).

"Jul 2, 2021","Britain's Bianca Saunders has won the 2021 Andam Fashion Awards set up to reward fashion creativity. The rising star designer picked up her prize in Paris on Thursday and in doing so joined a long list of winners that includes Martin Margiela, Christophe Lemaire, Viktor & Rolf and Jeremy Scott.Specialising in menswear that “challenges the modern perception of masculinity through her employment of innovative tailoring and fabric techniques”, the London-based designer has become known for ready-to-wear and accessories that draw on her British-Jamaican heritage.

She took home a €300,000 prize and will also receive a year of mentoring from Balenciaga CEO Cédric Charbit, who was chairman of this year’s jury. But fellow finalist Grace Wales-Bonner will also benefit from Andam’s addition of a second mentorship for the first time in its history.“I can’t put into words how thrilled I am to receive such a prestigious award and I am truly honoured”, Saunders said.

“Mentorship from such a key player in the industry, plus financial support like this will help me really focus on growing my business and realising my lifelong dream — establishing Bianca Saunders as a global fashion brand.”

Saunders also told FashionNetwork.com that she was in shock about winning the prize with the Royal College of Art graduate saying she though the fact that her label is “a little different” to the other, “more Parisian” finalists might work against her.

She also said that she’s spent much of the last year thinking about  where her brand goes next and and sees the development of online sales as key as well as further developing her accessories offer.

Saunders, who was also an LVMH Prize finalist this year, is hoping to present her collection in Paris in September. 

Meanwhile, other winners on Thursday included two-year-old gender-neutral brand EgonLab that took home the Pierre Bergé prize dedicated to emerging French fashion companies. The cash prize here was €100,000.

The Accessories prize went to French leathergoods brand Aswad. Worth €50,000, the prize was presented by Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, creative director of Swarovski. Aswad is a brand that blends French and Moroccan influences. It was founded in 2015 by  Sonia Ahmimou who had previously worked at Louis Vuitton, Moynat and Hermès.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 30, 2021","The end of the pandemic has been the focus of the fashion weeks that ended on June 27, whose shows heralded the industry’s palpable optimism, showcasing collections that were clearly conceived for a return to socialising and for enjoying the open air. The menswear collections for the Spring/Summer 2022 unveiled in London, Milan and Paris via a handful of in-person shows and the now-familiar video format, were distinctive for their wearability and great feeling of comfort, their laid-back mood and their unusual palette, veering from exuberant, even fluorescent colours to delicate, soothing hues in pastel or muted shades.1 Total looksEssential, timeless garments to be mixed and matched, provided they are all the same colour, including accessories, handbags, socks and shoes! Total looks are the new menswear mantra, as epitomised by Alessandro Sartori at Ermenegildo Zegna, as well as by most of the other designers, with their strictly monochrome sets in which clothes are layered and matched in a range of tone-on-tone combinations.2 Technicolor suitsSuits remain the centrepiece of men's wardrobes, but their proportions are now softer and lighter, especially around the shoulders and in the lining. Although the classic grey, white and black suits are still a thing, this menswear staple has become comfortable but no less elegant, done in unconventional colours. Either in a candy-colour palette infusing a whiff of freshness into summer outfits, from pink to sky blue, pale lilac and yellow. Or, conversely, in vibrant, acidic colours like red, green, turquoise and bright yellow, injecting wardrobes with new-found energy.3 Short-sleeved jacketsWithin the newly blurred boundaries of a wardrobe that is shedding the traditional codes of men’s fashion without jettisoning them altogether, the classic formal jacket has become a laboratory for all kinds of experiments. For next summer, the directional trend is the short-sleeved version, a hybrid design that is part jacket, part blouse. Some designers have even shortened it to above the navel, transforming it into a bolero like Fendi, or a pelerine like Wooyoungmi. In many collections, jackets are quite simply sleeveless, for extra comfort.4 Workwear and utility clothesAiming for ever-lighter and more practical outfits, designers have re-imagined clothes and accessories to make them more functional without overloading them, dipping with gusto in the world of workwear and its jackets with generous pockets, multi-pouch gilets and tote bags, dungarees and boiler suits. Everything in its place, for maximum ease of movement. Even the most basic wardrobe essentials have been redesigned in multi-function mode.5 OuterwearAfter being forced to shelter indoors for more than a year, in summer 2022 men will leave home comforts behind to enjoy life outdoors. Loungewear and the pyjama suits of seasons past are out, ushering in outdoor clothes (some collections were solely focused on this segment) as well as climbing and adventure outfits. Innovative ultra-light fabrics, high-tech nylon and feather-light wool are extensively used to produce jackets, windbreakers, overcoats, hunting vests, overshirts and safari jackets, matched with sport shorts and trousers overloaded with pockets.6 ShortsEvery collection featured them. Whether roomy and practical (again with pockets galore), in slightly retro mini versions, darted for a more formal look, worn a tad longer pirate-style, or lightweight like an invitation to go on holiday, there were shorts for everyone. They often replaced trousers in suits, and Prada even dared to present them in a romper-style version.7 Tie-dye and shaded effectsThe tie-dye trend seen in recent seasons continues undaunted, cropping up ubiquitously with all sorts of fabric treatments. Designers have innovated by testing different dyeing techniques, aiming to replicate as closely as possible the countless smudges and flecks time leaves on garments. Fabrics seem washed out and discoloured by sunlight, scored with shadings, reflections and whirls. Tie-dye effects crop up everywhere, on t-shirts, trousers, blouses, jackets, coats and even meshed garments. Shaded effects too are to be found everywhere, adding a gleeful, rainbow-like note to many outfits.8 Fishnet knitwearThese lightweight, casual garments are not without a hint of sensuality, especially the open-work sweaters and vests, or the fishnet tops that allow a glimpse of the skin beneath. Some items came in high-tech fabrics such as mesh, for a sportier look. This sensual register was also expressed through a penchant for baring the skin, as in the silk shirts unbuttoned down to the navel, and through the use of lace, still highly popular for tops, shirts and trousers. Designers also went for sheer effects and sexy underwear.9 Festive moodMany menswear collection videos seen this season looked forward to the post-Covid period. Next year is expected to bring a return to normality, especially next summer, hence collection films embraced a liberating return to evenings out with sequins, lurex and flamboyant outfits. Men will wear a profusion of jewellery and the most beautiful finery to go out and have a great time. Colours will explode, silhouettes will shine. There will be plenty of occasions to get those satin suits and those outfits in lavish brocaded fabrics out of the closet.10 Maxi skirtsLong draped skirts, down to the ankles and below, are now a feature of men's wardrobes. They were spotted notably at Louis Vuitton, samurai-style, at Yohji Yamamoto, at Avellano in a neo-futuristic design with a nod to The Matrix, at Tokyo James, which combined a long African-style loincloth with a classic black jacket-white shirt combo, at JordanLuca in a variety of lengths, at Loewe and at Thom Browne in a shorter, pleated version.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 30, 2021","There is a great debate in fashion today. Will women want elegance and sophistication when the pandemic eventually ends or will their biggest needs just be ease and comfort? Ian Griffiths, creative director of Max Mara, clearly believes they will chose the path of refinement and grace.
 
His Cruise 2022 collection for Max Mara, staged Tuesday evening in the splendor of Italy’s most talked about hotel, the Mezzatorre on the beautiful verdant island of Ischia, was a paean to the Swans: Truman Capote’s legendary gang of beautiful and rich lady friends – Slim Keith, Lee Radziwill, Gloria Guinness, Babe Paley, C. Z. Guest and Marella Agnelli. The beauties who inspired Breakfast at Tiffany’s and whose unique patrician sense of style, of being “a living work of art,” as Capote put it, has left an enduring legacy in fashion. 
Searching for inspiration for his first post-lockdown of 2021, Griffiths caught up with some of his favorite novels when he discovered that Capote had actually spent a spring on Ischia, included in a brilliantly written description in his global travels. Four months on Ischia, where he lived in a pensione just west of Mezzatorre in the fishing village of Forio, described in his third book, Local Color. Hence, the title of the collection.
 
So, the collection and show followed a subtle balancing act between the honest simplicity of island life to the uber sophistication of the Swans, who would twice yearly descend on Paris for the haute-couture season: “lunching in the Ritz; dining in Maxim’s,” said Griffiths, expanding on his inspiration.The result was a rather couture-take on cruise, and all the better for it. Too often cruise collections can be reduced down to skimpy cocktail wear and swimwear for trophy girlfriends. Not with Griffiths at Max Mara, where the silhouettes were hyper-refined and flattering – designed for women with busy professional lives.
 
Presenting new versions of Max Mara’s classic 101801 double-breasted coat in techno-jersey.  

“So they bounce back and don’t crease when you wrap the up for a journey. That’s what good design is,” stressed Griffiths.
 
He made cocktails with high funnel-necks; cut dresses with a high waistline and puckered below; and gathered blazers at the back. 
 His most sensational look was high-neck, beige confederate-cut coat finished like a cape. Like most looks, it was anchored by espadrilles and sporting sandals underlining the sense of practical ease.

Like Truman’s Swans, the opulence was in the simplicity, high living with simple food, like a simple spaghetti, or spaghettata, thrown together among friends, with a sauce made of fresh local tomatoes.
 
Ischia’s hills and cliffs are covered with geraniums, as are the window boxes of among hotel favorite of the Swans, the Plaza Athenée in Paris. So Griffiths one key print was of micro-geraniums seen in the sort of long tunics seen on Marella Agnelli.
 
Otherwise there was none of the surface decoration or embroidery one associates with many couture collections.
 
“This collection is about clothes that work with you, and not show off you are going on a trip,” stressed the designer.
 
In another link to 1950s refinement, Max Mara asked Ginevra Elkann, grand-daughter of Marella, to shoot the show video, and drone cameras floated in the sunset above the stone runway, verdant cove and wine dark Mediterranean sea throughout the show. 
 
A film school graduate, Ginevra will release her Max Mara video on Thursday 1 July at 3 p.m. on MaxMara.com.Due to Covid, barely 90 guests attended the show, which began with the cast arriving by yacht onto the dock of the Mezzatorre, sunset setting on the Med. And not just any sailing boat, the same model as the elegant 43-foot sloop used in Anthony Minghella’s 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley; the dark tale of self-indulgent living and murder among wealthy ex-pat American WASPs, which was shot in Ischia.
 
Backed up by a memorably atmospheric soundtrack by New York DJ, Johnny Dynell, including Una Notte a Napoli, with lyrics by Alba Clemente, who attended the show and dinner with husband, master neo-expressionist painter Francesco Clemente.
 
Dynell spinning at a post-dinner dance around the pool as today’s micro equivalent of the Swans, influencers, bopped around – the likes of Caroline Daur, Xenia Adonts, Alexandra Pereira, Leonie Hanne and Camila Coelho. A moment with a striking sense of release and joie de vivre as people enjoyed the simple joy of a few fun dances.
 
Though where the Swans were the beautiful wives of wealthy bankers and industrialists, today’s Instagram Swans actually hired their own husbands to be their social media photographers.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 29, 2021","French label Officine Générale has returned to its fashion roots with a physical catwalk show that was one of the handful of in-person events held during the latest Paris menswear fashion week.Last Friday, Pierre Maheo, the label’s founder and designer, celebrated his catwalk come-back in a palatial building on rue des Francs Bourgeois, in the heart of the Marais district. “The multiple issues that have tormented my professional circle weren’t enough to rein in my enthusiasm. Reasonable, I have been for many months. And that's why, without any further ado, I decided to stage again a real catwalk show, featuring girls and boys living life with gusto,” said Maheo in the note that came with the presentation.

A craving to return to real life, away from screens and digital presentations, that translated in a collection that perfectly encapsulates that special Parisian street vibe. “My inspiration is again very Parisian,” acknowledged Maheo. “Though I was unable to travel, my mind managed to escape. And then I rediscovered Paris, inevitably. I took the time to look more closely at its people,” said Maheo, who is well-known for his refined cuts and his mastery of a kind of laid-back, elegant tailoring that eschews undue sophistication. A DNA that fits perfectly with the Parisian wardrobe of people with a penchant for understated style.An approach as classic as it is effective which, for the Spring/Summer 2022, featured a fresh take on the French label's essentials, in both menswear and womenswear. Continuity and expertise were evident in the loose, voluminous trousers, in trousers with straighter cuts from the knee down, or even in the occasional nod to skater style. Not to mention the obligatory suits and several monochrome trousers-and-jacket sets, for those well-balanced office looks.

Officine Générale's colour palette has gone beyond the classic navy, ivory and grey, exploring the possibilities of an intense olive green or turning to an unexpected lavender hue, cropping up in a handful of looks at the tail end of the show, among which stood out an airy mid-length dress complemented by a magenta belt.Fabrics-wise, linen was used for some lightweight sweaters. Maheo also resorted to recycled denim, treated with an extra soft finish, for some men's and women's trousers and jackets, and even for shorts. Officine Générale also showcased a few mid-season items, such as hoodies and a number of leather bomber jackets.

Despite the strong Parisian influence reflected in Maheo's latest collection, Officine Générale has international markets in its sights. “Officine Générale is one of those companies that have the opportunity to exit the health crisis stronger than before because of their founding values,” said Maheo, kingpin of the label founded in 2012. Indeed, last May, Officine Générale raised funds with The Untitled Group from the USA. The objective is to expand the label’s business in the US, where Officine Générale is finalising a store opening in New York. Parisian style seems ready to win over Manhattan.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Jun 29, 2021","Philadelphia-based fashion brand Paulo Redeem is the winner of the inaugural Amiri Prize. The designer behind the brand NaaAmerley Badger will take home $100,000, as well as a year-long mentorship with Amiri. Badger beat out two other finalists, Ayama and Victor Li, to take home the grand prize.

Launched in 2019, each Paulo Redeem design is customized from redeemed (upcycled) materials from the designer’s own wardrobe plus donations from family and friends. Meanwhile, the brand’s design style is characterized by maximized embellishment, functionality, and exaggerated structure. The Amiri Prize by Mike Amiri, founder and creative director of L.A. men’s and women’s brand Amiri, was established as an annual fashion incubator to inspire hidden fashion talent across the U.S. Applications opened on Wednesday, March 17 for one month.

The prize winner, which may include American residents whose ready-to-wear business is one to threes years old, was selected by a panel of judges comprising of Salehe Bembury, owner of Spunge; Chris Gibbs, owner of Union Los Angeles; Glenn Martens, creative director of Diesel and Y/Project; Nikki Ogunnaike, digital director, Harper’s Bazaar; Renzo Rosso, president of OTB; and Kala Welch, celebrity stylist.

“This last year provided a lot of time for me to reflect on many things including the current state of our industry. I wanted to address the current lack of opportunity for creatives from diverse backgrounds. The global crisis we are facing adds another challenge to designers who have been able to make a start but are not established enough to weather the storm,” the designer told FashionNetwork.com, back in March.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 28, 2021","Few fashion weeks are as international as Paris Menswear season, especially during the pandemic. As designers and marques never reach the French capital yet are determined to be listed on its official show schedule.We looked at three strong fashion statements, from a rapidly rising design based in Berlin, GmbH; a classic London label enjoying a renaissance, Dunhill; and a San Francisco-born designer who has made Paris his home, Spencer Phipps.
 GmbHParis’ stand-out video show and collection was from GmbH, by two creators named Serhat Işık and Benjamin A. Huseby, who live in Berlin and have just been hired to design for the house of Trussardi in Milan.
 
GmbH, whose name comes from the German equivalent of 'Ltd Co.', shot a cool video that recalled that great early sci-fi classic THX 1138, with distances made redundant by all the endless white space.
 
In which GmbH Berliner buccaneers walked in multiple versions of the boots – from pirate to riding to Wild West, via Vegas.
 
Their vision is a pure one: wraparound Dick Turpin redingotes; disco dragoons with slim jodhpurs and show-jumper boots; pink silk shirts tied up Latin-lover style; powder-blue jeans completed with matching jockstraps.
 
They drape extra straps of fabric around the torso; and pipe and trim most looks, adding polish and even poise.
 
Politically they are also committed: their second look was a Free Palestine T-shirt; while red cashmere sweaters are finished with a white hammer and sickle.
 
Above all the duo captures the artistic ferment of Berlin without all the worn, rain-washed after-hours black clothes that one associates with Germany’s party and political capital.
 
It all manages to be proud, punchy and yet even preppy too – all the way to the great worn denim jeans paired with denim dressing gowns; or denim gown trimmed with white marabou feathers. All worn with superhero shades by the proudest of casts.
 
Işık and Huseby will make their Trussardi debut with the fall-winter 2022 season. Judging by this collection for their own brand, Trussardi will be the most anticipated show in Milan.
 
 Phipps: Upcycled survivalist for summer 2021 
“I’m trying to reclaim survivalist for a liberal point of view,” smiled bearded Spencer Phipps, the San Francisco designer who has created a burgeoning fashion house in Paris.
 
His aesthetic for next summer: workwear and active sportswear meets upcycling to create wearable funky fashion. Presented as a four-minute video on Sunday, the final day of Paris Menswear Week in Paris. 
 
Like 90% of houses on the official calendar, Phipps skipped the runway this season, instead presenting a four-minute video that included outback nomads, wilderness weekenders and Mexican wrestlers, shot inside a virtual post-modern Coliseum.
 
What worked best were his patchwork ideas – like body-hugging mini jackets in Loro Piana pinstripes and panels of upcycled nylon; or abstract camouflage hunting gear for inner city raves.
 
Spencer is so into upcycling, he created a whole capsule based on famed club jerseys – from the Miami Dolphins to Manchester United. Using a vintage Man-U shirt, the sort once worn by Eric Cantona.
 
Phipps suggested that Cantona might work the shirt in his video. His agent brother loved the idea but suggested in return a fee of 100,000 euros.
 
Phipps demurred naturally - not exactly a survivalist fee.
 
 DunhillParka-mania at Dunhill, where designer Mark Weston has pushed the brand rather forward while maintaining a large dose of its Britishness.
 
His big idea this season was the concept of Identities, exploring uniforms and contrasting homespun versus sophistication.
 
“I wanted an evolution of last season, I don’t start randomly fresh from zero. More about playing and toying with codes.The Dunhill people – reflecting London and what’s contemporary in menswear,” added Weston in a Zoom from his Mayfair studio.
 
No show, but a gritty lookbook video where an inclusive cast are collaged before Edwardian redbrick London, strutting around in Weston’s techy active take on the storied UK label. Evolving his parkas into single-breasted archetypes; and playing with his multi-panel Compendium trenches. Reinventing the traditional in unexpected materials: like a classic shirt in white silk faille with a placket, all multi-puckered to make it look like seersucker. Or his Deco knitwear with four-pocket patch cardigans finished with elongated 'D' logos.
 
Weston’s other big innovation was working with photographer Ellen Carey – a photographic artist who works with Polaroids.
 
“What struck me about her work was the graphics, color and sense of abstraction,” explained the designer, who fused elements of Carey’s back catalogue into dramatic silk faille shirts and tops in a black and white abstract animal print. Leaving many with raw edges and trim, where the photographer’s name and photo were listed.
 
With the UK just about emerging from lockdown, how was the atmosphere in London?
 
“Our stores are open, and there has been good traffic. But remote working with factories is challenging. We’ve made things work, and I am happy but I cannot wait to actually visit the factory again!” he shrugs.

"Jun 28, 2021","Paris Fashion Week ended on a high note on Sunday. Alongside the big names, a plethora of labels stood out in the last day of catwalk shows, presenting stimulating collections in a wide range of styles. Notable among them Japanese label Doublet, French labels Pigalle Paris and Lemaire, and South Korean label Wooyoungmi. Doublet’s rural punkJapanese designer Masayuki Ino, winner of the LVMH Prize in 2018, has unveiled his Spring-Summer 2022 collection with a catwalk show staged in Japan, inviting his guests out in the countryside, among greenhouses and vineyards. The tone was set from the start by the thunderous notes of the rock anthem accompanying the show.The models roll in, piercings and spiky punk hairstyles prominent in their bad-boy looks, clad in personalised black leather jackets and trousers, or in tops and shorts in turquoise and green lurex.

Little by little though, the wardrobe seems to veer towards the rural, brimming with vegetable references such as the leek-coloured tie, the denim jackets sprouting mushrooms on their back, or the patches shaped like onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and oranges decorating a jacket's lapels or woven, like a jigsaw of washers or doilies, into crocheted cardigans and other knitwear.Pigalle Paris’s techno-craftsmanshipStéphane Ashpool has changed register. The jack-of-all-trades French designer/businessman picked a jazzy soundtrack to unveil some of his new collection’s items in a short film running to barely a few minutes. The film is chiefly about sensations, conveyed through an experiential video blending images of water, light, reflections, close-ups of textures, and coloured dyes dripping and flowing on fabrics.

It traces the ageing, perforating and crackling treatments to which the leather of a jacket-shirt and a pair of patchwork trousers is subjected to. Elsewhere, the focus is on fluidity of movement, highlighted in a silk fuchsia pyjama-suit. There is always a sportswear vibe to the garments, as in the shorts-and-top outfit in fleeced cotton worn by a model through a slow-motion sequence.Lemaire’s everyday eleganceAt Lemaire, the models, both men and women, stride across the screen in profile, wearing lightweight trench-coats with wide lapels, worn over cotton skirts or trousers in the same neutral hues, variations on a grey and beige palette. Everything is smooth but perfectly crafted, comfortable but sophisticated, generously cut while wonderfully accenting the silhouette.

From mid-length dresses with a classic feel to suits-and-shirts total-look combos, to more casual outfits featuring t-shirts, baggy jeans, cute little tops, denim jackets and shorts, Lemaire’s simple yet skilfully constructed clothes look like winners.

The models wear them with ease, whether running through a downpour or brightened by warm summer sunshine that highlights the abstract, colourful prints of Lemaire’s cotton sets and oversize canvas bundle bags. Designer duo Christophe Lemaire and Sarah-Linh Tran shine notably with their draped dresses made from a single piece of fabric that gently envelops the body, wrapping it in a delicate swathe of frills.Wooyoungmi, or the art of detailA railway station with an imposing Art Deco canopy is the backdrop for the South Korean label’s ‘catwalk show’ video, in which the models stroll alongside the station’s massive red wrought-iron pillars, clad in elegant outfits alternating neatly cut sets and innovative sportswear looks, while the backdrop gradually dissolves into weird psychedelic swirls.

Woo Young Mi, who founded the label in 2018 and took back over the creative direction of the label in March 2020, puts painstaking attention into the collection’s details and accessories, from the cuffs of some sweatshirts to the wide elastic belts that mould the waistline like a corset, worn over trousers, shorts and even waterproof jackets.

She has fun notably with a particularly quirky item, a kind of hooded shrug featured in tough cotton, like the fabric used in trench-coats, or in a technical mesh fabric, combined with a mesh hood and worn like a plastron.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 27, 2021","Sphere, the incubator salon and platform for young talent showing in Paris, suddenly looked like it grew up this season, as a group of emerging designers unveiled vibrant collections. 
Previously, France’s Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode had developed a space called Designer Apartment for fledgling talent, though too often it featured barely-out-of-college student collections that didn’t really look professional. 
 
Sphere, on the other hand, seems far more serious, with bona-fide young professional fashion marques making polished and original clothes. Moreover, its new location inside the Palais de Tokyo provided the airy space and natural light these designers needed. Disparate yet all dynamic, collections shown were by Arturo Obegero, Uniforme, LGN (reviewed earlier here) and Valette, who all showed striking ideas and subtle advances in menswear. While a virtual tour of the collections by another five labels is available on the platform.
 Arturo Obegero: Sequined seductionSpanish-born Arturo Obegero has flamenco in his fingertips, and his spikily glamorous collection for guys and girls had plenty of Gitano grit.
 
Elongated jumpsuits in black crepe; flowing pajamas in striped silk viscose; surgically cut super skinny Latin lover suits in, jersey, pinstripe or crepe. All looked great.
 
“We’ve been locked up in pajamas at home, so I wanted dandy pajamas to make you feel sexy and beautiful when you go out,” explained Obegero.
 
Nona Source, the LVMH fabric company that supplies high-quality dead stock to young designers, provided the marvelous crepe used in tuxedo shirts, the same Arturo wore prowling about Sphere.
 
For grander entrances, he dreamed up a humungous turquoise sequined ball gown. “It’s like Pina Bausch on acid,” quipped the designer.
 
Arturo’s video of super skinny flamenco dancers and black-eyed femme fatales dancing and emoting around a dance studio loft had plenty of pep. Crowning his season, seven of his cast staged a mini show before the video inside Sphere – a sexy indie fashion moment from a designer well worth watching.
 
 Uniforme: Work wear with flights of fancyWork wear with some wonderful differences from Uniforme, by the French duo of Hugues Fauchard and Rémi Bats.
 
The duo describes its DNA as “conscious minimalism,” though the net result was a cool reinterpretation of French aviation imagery.
 
Their elegiac show video featured a couple of guys in the charming rural enclave of Vexin, in northern France. The two young models playing with an enormous model airplane imagining possible flights and journeys.
 
A metaphor for the universal desire for travel in the lockdown from the Uniforme duo, who were recently named as finalists for ANDAM’s Pierre Bergé prize; as well as being picked out as a special guest for the “Sustainable Style” initiative at Pitti 100 in Florence.
 
For Spring/Summer 2022 they showed sun-bleached aviator jackets with a hand-silkscreened cockade on the back; jumpsuits in parachute fabrics with contrasting knitwear shoulders; and cool linen safari jackets with double-face military belts. 
 
Nearly all made by traditional French artisans and suppliers with excellent finishes – including a colonel’s interior stitching for pockets. They even presented a great pair of black leather brogues made together with Weston, finished with a silver trim and their signature strip logo at the back.
 
“With this collection, we wanted to say that you can dream of fashion, flying, or anything else. What inspired us to go into fashion in the first place is that it’s an industry where anything is possible,” said the duo. And they succeeded.
  
 Valette Studio: Camus couture for menSavoir-faire and subtlety was the key to a very fine collection from Pierre-François Valette, whose brand is called Valette Studio.
 
An alumnus of the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, who later cut his teeth at Isabel Marant and Saint Laurent, Valette focuses on materials and techniques to create a modernist French aesthetic.
 
His summer 2022 collection was inspired by the writings of the great French existentialist author Albert Camus, seeing a romantic adventurer from North Africa who develops his own wardrobe as a tribute to couture and handcraft.
 
Striking oversized, yet perfectly cut tailored trousers, chunky cable knitwear with earthy finishes; and a couple of great trench coats trimmed with braided wool were some of the standouts. Made in faded pink, pistachio green, dry denim blue, and old burgundy red, the color palette was truly attractive.
 
Plus, Valette also showed the T-shirt of the Paris season, a wonderful hand-embroidered image, and exact replica of ink drawing of his in-house model. Camus would have found it cool, we bet.

"Jun 27, 2021","All about rouch 'n' roll and berserk braiding at Y/Project this season, where creative director Glenn Martens' big concept for next spring was interweaving strands of fabric. 
Fresh from presenting his debut collection for Diesel in Italy, Martens unspooled a show video on Sunday at Paris Menswear Week for his experimental fashion house Y/Project where he threaded and interlaced with abandon. 
 
For Spring/ Summer 2021, Y/Project will dress gals in Aran cable-knit sweaters with braided necklines that don’t have defined places to put your neck; in braided jersey cocktails and asymmetrical denim dresses interlaced at the top.“Clothes where you can choose your own hole to put your head,” laughed Martens in a pre-show Zoom from his Paris home in the edgy Goutte d’Or neighborhood, just behind the Gare du Nord train station. 
A spiral story –where garments come in multi layers, and every looked had some braiding. Best of all, faded yellow dresses made in layers of crepe and organza with multi-braided necklines and embellished cleavages.
 
Martens even multiplied shoulders, so they looked like an assortment of petals – made from what looked like fake leather, but was actually plastic.
 
His Escher-like zeal to make people study any garment several times to understand its dimensions evident in cardigans that morphed into shirts; or the Dick Turpin highway-man coats deconstructed at the shoulder. 
“There are so many things going on in a Y/Project collection, I don’t think a show video needs much art direction. So we shot a simple old fashioned video in a movie studio in Brie sur Marne. While they were shooting Asterix and Obelisk next door! There was even an old Chinatown set and and people running around in costumes. A pretty interesting place to shoot,” laughed Martens, dragging on a cigarette.
  
Between Y/Project and his new gig as creative director of Diesel, Martens has been working seven days a week. Yet he still found time for a collab with Italian active sport heritage label Fila.
 
“Fila is huge in Asia and Y/Project is popular there too, so both our consumers loved the idea of this alliance,” said the Belgian designer, who included 20th-anniversary Fila basketball sneakers with writing at angles on the shoes. 
The result led to about a dozen looks in a show of 75 passages, 
 
Ever investigational, Martens composed several oversized formal Fila jumpsuits; mini cocktails that were part sweater, and exaggerated sweatshirts and double-panel pants with logos inside that were revealed by a pulling a drawstring.
 
Rouch and roll indeed.

"Jun 27, 2021","Clubbing culture without any boundaries at Loewe, where the key inspiration this season were the funky naïve paintings of sexual liberation by German artist, Florian Krewer. 
Clubbing culture from the disco-ball dresses to psychedelic bugle-bead mini-cocktails and tanks. Including the first rate, Rasta-haired, naked torso dancer who was the real star of the latest fashion flick from Loewe, Spain’s most prestigious luxury label. Even Anderson’s elephant bag for Loewe got the bugle-bead treatment.
 
His cast appearing in a four-minute video in triple-layer, acid-hued oversized basketball tanks or huge satin bow tops for models who looked mainly masculine, yet faintly genderless. Unveiled on Saturday as part of the Paris Men's Fashion Week, and available for all to see on that platform.A show video that included abstract versions of Loewe’s soft, gothic logo seen on loosely woven knits or sheer pink chiffon tops; worn over long multi-strand skirts and great acrylic, green rope pants.
 
“Awkward beauty in a kind of optimism stage,” explained Loewe’s creative director, Jonathan Anderson in the video.   
The leader of the whole pandemic show-in-the-box movement, this season Anderson sent editors not one but two books; and in the process changed his pick of photographers. After working closely with Juergen Teller at his signature brand J W Anderson, he teamed up with David Sims for Loewe.
 
The result managed to be a more youthful, yet also more opulent vision by Sims, one of fashion photography’s acknowledged masters. Sims' images of cool clubbing kids in poster-bedecked basements had tremendous oomph. The cast, found in Marseille, suggested some new underground dance movement that managed to remain secret.
 
A little too much cotton ribbed pink tops perhaps, though with charming romantic graphics. And one had to love the wacky matelassé moon boots; the neon-logo trenches and matching backpacks – all in a blend of Krewer’s colours – metallic plumb or electric shamrock.
 
Plus, the designer unveiled a new material, cactus leather, which reflected light like liquid metal. 
 
“I wanted something where we were not getting locked into a universal gender boundary,” explained Anderson in his latest video tutorial.

"Jun 27, 2021","Hermès unveiled the latest post-pandemic Spring/Summer 2022 collection of Paris Men's Fashion Week at Saturday lunchtime, an optimistic, sunny choice of clothes staged in steady downpour. 
Hermès likes to consider itself as the true exemplar of discreet luxury but it is to its credit that the house’s menswear designer Véronique Nichanian creates discretion with real panache.
 
She took the decision to stage her show outside – one of just a half-dozen live runway events before an audience in Paris this season. The weather gods had other ideas. But the house provided its 150 guests with enveloping wet-weather, hooded ponchos, and the show went on. Rending the audience like members of a new order of techy monks.The setting itself was perfect: the Mobilier National, a giant pre-war Modernist building which warehouses the finest state-owed furniture in France for use in embassies and ministries. Kitted out with some mammoth video screens showing the cast circling the building’s courtyard.
 
“It’s nice to be back with a live show. We are optimistic people, even if it rains on our show!” laughed Nichanian, whose last real catwalk appearance was in January 2020. 
 
As it turned out she also had a healthy share of waterproofs in the collection – opening with great zippered parka/trenches and including a beautiful computer-graphic nylon duster, the same pattern as the invitation to the show.Handsome lightweight reversible jackets, in contrasting fabrics – like plain thin lizard and technical cotton – what call Nichanian called “double jeu,” or playing both sides in English. Plus, her out-of-focus print silk shirts; perforated tops and dip-dyed cashmere cable cardigans managed to be hip, yet very classy.
 
Moreover, few colour palettes are subtler than Hermès – celadon-green; washed out carbon; faded rose or light algae. Accessories, vital in a brand like Hermès, all looked super swish, from the piped high-tops to the new canvas totes with triple-stripe 'H' logos.
 
Despite the steady rain, Nichanian garnered hearty applause at the finale, taking an extended bow.
 
“With Covid we have found a new way to dress. A distinctive way of dressing in new materials, a fresh coloration; a new elegance, in my view. Like playing with our heritage with patterns; perforating the H; playing with 3D; double printing,” added the designer post-show, as a crowd of ponchos gathered about her. 
 
And the rain fell steadily in the courtyard.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 26, 2021","Paul Smith is off to his villa in Italy next week, and already has all the clothes one might want to wear in Tuscany, an ideal Spring/Summer collection to finally escape the pandemic.
 
Lightweight jackets in twills and cottons, with no structure and no shoulder pads, all made for a very easy-to-wear spring/summer 2022 collection, presented digitally Friday afternoon as part of Paris Men's Fashion Week.The designer dreaming of getting outdoors again and back to his house near Lucca, using a colour palette of dawn-to-dusk colours.
 
“Light of sunshine in the morning; pale citrus or ecru and terracotta like the local buildings,” he mused.Fashion’s knight also whipped up great floral print jerkins, jeans and tops, featuring images of sunflower fields in Tuscany. One even printed on a lightweight seersucker top, others in Hawaiian-style shirts.His high-colour, horizontal-stripe knits featured multiple finishes, made from contrasting moss stitches or diagonal stitches. Plus, he finished many items with zig-zag stitching, like the form used on Hobie Cat sail stitching.
 
His summer-fun dudes all shod in docksiders – in Smith’s case “old Massachusetts, hairy, suede dock shoes.”
 
In his showroom there will still be classic suits, but with the break from the lockdown such a priority, men want casual clothing above all, Smith reckons.

“It will take some time for time to get guys to back into suits after this long period casually dressed at home. They will again but it will take time. I’m off to Lucca next week. Though we have to isolate for five days when we arrive. New regulations. We have not been allowed out of Britain for so long! First time in years I have not been to Japan – normally go every year,” lamented Sir Paul, in a pre-show zoom. 
Despite not making it to Japan, the collection also featured a partnership with cult local bag company Porter – again riffing on his signature contrasting stripe codes. Seen in Smith’s oeuvre everywhere from his iconic Mini Cooper S to cycling tops.
 
“They are old mates of mine the Yoshida family who own Porter. I’m real chuffed that they wanted to do something and I'm very pleased with the results,” smiled Smith.
 
His seven-minute show video featured 42 outfits, presented like a live show, though pre-recorded in a studio in Acton with a cloud formation ceiling, and his cast marching on a mock terrazzo floor.

"Jun 26, 2021","French fashion label Courrèges made its return to menswear at Paris Men’s Fashion Week on Wednesday with a romantic yet sharp collection, created by Belgian designer Nicolas Di Felice.The co-ed collection, like the majority of runway shows at the French men’s fashion week, was presented with a film, the second episode for Di Felice after his womenswear collection for the brand was unveiled in March. 
 
A white cube within the industrial wasteland of La Station- Gare des Mines in Aubervilliers (Seine-Saint-Denis), a live music venue at the epicentre of Paris’ counter culture, served as the setting for the two collections. For Wednesday’s finale, this décor gave way to the edge of a forest, symbolising a re-found freedom gained with the slowdown of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Elegant and cut close to the body, the Courrèges silhouette stood out from the oversized, gender neutral silhouettes which had dominated fashion week since Tuesday. 
 
This collection sees Di Felice mix graphic elements such as the brand’s iconic square necklines and trapeze dresses with the workwear elements, which draw from the silhouettes of the world of work, for which he has great affection.
 
A large checked coat with raglan sleeves is paired with a cap and a zip-up jacket. Di Felice, a Belgian, also chose to present clogs and a striking sleeveless jacket for the first time. The collection also saw the designer’s monochrome palette broaden to include a sunny yellow along with signature hues of black and white. 
 
Di Felice was named as Courrèges’ creative director in September to breathe new life into the Parisian fashion house which became famous in the 1960s for its futuristic style. 
 
Di Felice, who is 38 years old, graduated from La Cambre in Brussels, Belgium, before working for Balenciaga, Dior, and Louis Vuitton alongside designer Nicolas Ghesquière. Di Felice took over from German designer Yolanda Zobel at Courrèges who left the brand in January 2020 after two years of well-received collections and a commitment to end plastic production.

"Jun 24, 2021","Certain deep-pocketed brands can stage two shows for their collections the better to reach a larger live audience. Very few have ever pulled off what Louis Gabriel Nouchi managed on Thursday, stage two entirely different collections by the same designer in the same morning. Both of them very much worthy of watching, and wearing.The French-born designer’s first collection was for Joeone, a giant Chinese brand largely unknown in the West that nonetheless boasts 700 stores and the remarkable claim of selling a pair of trousers every seven seconds. While his second piece of action was for his own brand LGN – both of them unveiled with finesse at the fountain of the Palais de Tokyo.
 
Many designers – most notably the great Rick Owens – have staged shows in this location, but Nouchi, operating on a modest budget, managed to make the setting his own. Building a massive flat mirror dock in the center of the pool and letting his cast march seemingly on water. That fit perfectly with the theme of Joeone, presented at 9 a.m. under cloudy skies,  the idea of characters taking the silk road from China to Europe. Best illustrated by some really great mint or washed out blue Toile de Jouy prints, reinvented to include everything from Chinese dragons to Italian gondolas, the Arc de Triomphe or the Grande Arche de la Defense at the finale.  Made with great billowing pants; swaddling shorts and fantastic black calico trousers with a junk print; anchored with hiking sandals; and accessorized with deep totes and shoulder bags, this was a concise and clever collection.

“The idea was to go back to the Silk Road, a path retracing China to Europe passing along sea lanes. That is why you see a lot of maritime symbols. I started with the Toile de Jouy, a French pattern, and then adapted it to different destinations,” explained Nouchi, a graduate of La Cambre fashion school in Brussels, and who has worked for Raf Simons.
  One hour later, using the same cast but more early-morning makeup, Nouchi sent out casual-yet-urbane urban wear for LGN in a co-ed collection, all inspired by the 1984 novel The Lover by Marguerite Duras. Though, the designer in fact renamed the collection Unauthorized after the publishers refused Nouchi the right to even mention the book’s title.
 
A tale of a teenage Western beauty’s love affair with an older Asian man, the sexual intensity of the novel, and acclaimed film, was a great spring board for a collection, which looked made for the boudoir as much as the avenue. 
“It’s all the reflection about the bathrobe; indoor and external clothes. The collection is very ambivalent between the feminine and the masculine, and focuses on the idea of sensuality. So, we started also to imagine how she could be dressed, with big glasses, big pearl necklaces, this bourgeois Left Bank side that we made super sexy, because the book is super sulphurous and I wanted this more to be sensual then sexual,” added Nouchi.
 
Playing with marble-print fabrics and judo-like materials he composed wide colonial shorts; plantation-owner jackets; silk-lined dressing gowns in denim or fine wools for after parties; and natty low-gorge cardigans.
 
Highly assured in his choice of silhouette and setting, Nouchi and LGN seem poised for rapid growth. He is also confident enough to stage the only two live shows in Paris among a dozen brands listed on the calendar. And today includes the likes of Louis Vuitton, Issey Miyake and Dries Van Noten.

"Jun 24, 2021","Paris Fashion Week Men actually had two live runway shows on Wednesday, the second of the six-day season, as the fashion capital cautiously emerges from the lockdown. 
 
In both live shows before actual audiences, the designers went color crazy amid mash-up madness, in spring/summer 2022 collections from hipster French new labels – Bluemarble and Cool TM.
 
Elsewhere, J W Anderson and Courrèges unveiled strong style statements in purely digital displays. 
 Bluemarble Founded just two years ago by the Filipino-French designer Anthony Alvarez, Bluemarble staged its debut runway show in the courtyard of the Archive National, a magnificent palace in the heart of the Marais. 
Even before the show began, the brand already seem fired-up and full of momentum, as a score of local rap stars took their seats in the front row of the courtyard’s loggia.
 
Proud of his part Filipino origin, Alvarez riffed on everything from tropical surfers to St Tropez playboys in a high energy show; mixing up unlikely garments and assemblages. Like pairing dueling shirts over silk t-shirts and pajama pants.A runway bursting with color from the cargo pants in silk prints that included coral, tropical birds; coconuts, bright whistles and buoys. Sweatpants came in bitter orange, jeans emblazoned in sherbet-hued star fish.
 
Backed up by a rocking soundtrack, like Missy Elliott’s song Scream A.K.A. Itchin’, Alvarez won a huge roar of applause as he ran all the way around the courtyard before his bow.
 
“I wanted the sense of youth appropriating an historic location in the center of Paris. I’m inspired by American sportswear and from surfing in the Philippines, but with a French touch,” explained Alvarez, who called his prints 'Marchand de Sable' or sand merchant, as they referenced objects one found washed up on shore.
 Cool TMUnveiled before less than 100 guests in a beautifully ram-shackled old Haussmann mansion overlooking the city’s grand statute of George Washington. 
Which felt like a good location for Cool TM's mélange of arty, preppy American-dude style with French high-fashion and costume designs. Designer Thomas Monet is certainly irreverent enough to send out offbeat versions of the Chanel jacket worn over hyper-distressed denim loon pants; or hyper-feminine floral teal blue floral-print pants paired with faux-crocodile jerkins.
 
For day, or evening, he presented lots of oversized mixes – most strikingly couture metallic jacket pants worn under a massively exaggerated lime green sweatshirt and a battered acid-dyed yellow camouflage sleeveless jean jacket finished with pearls.
 
If that sounds like way too much that is because it was. And ideal for the Instagram generation where the whole point of the exercise is to turn heads and look like you are just back from a music festival.
 J W AndersonThe London-based designer staged a double-header look-book and video collection seminar for his men's spring/summer 2022 and women’s resort 2022 collections. 
During the pandemic, this designer has sent editors and VIPs very handsomely prepared “shows in the box,” and this was no exception. His latest look-book was 33 printed images shot by Juergen Teller; accompanied by a “video message” from the brand’s founder and creative director Jonathan Anderson posted on the house’s social media and on the Paris Fashion Week platform.
 
The German photographer’s prints all wrapped up inside 18th-century paper with a painting of a squirrel eating an acorn next to a bowl of strawberries, in a beautiful image.
 
In his explanatory video, Anderson showed-off pictures within pictures – with many looks in frames perched on chairs, or tacked onto walls.
 
“When I was younger, we used to get our pictures taken at school and you’d get these packs of photos and frames. I liked that concept of each of the photos being able to stand on their own. You could even put it on your mantelpiece,” explained the Northern Irish designer.
 
Shot on location at a banal suburban home in southeast London, the collection featured his anchor logo chunky knits; cut-out oversized tops; seaside-stripe flared cocktails for gals. 
 
For guys – giant strawberry print tracksuits; logo boxer shorts; abstract floral parkas or outside daisy tops. Throughout, his JWA logo was everywhere; from pool sandals, to white socks, to chenille tanks.
 
Indulgence and hedonistic, the collection was meant to evoke those moments in one’s bedroom where you can pretend to be anyone you want, according to the program notes.
 
However, the self-editing button never appears to have been pressed in this collection from the green strawberry print knits to the beaded curtain dresses. Even pillows got reconfigured as dresses in what was ultimately an intriguing, yet inconclusive fashion statement.
 CourrègesOne brand suddenly on the move, and very rapidly, is Courrèges -- a house that many have attempted to revive, but now under the creative direction of Nicolas di Felice -- seems, well, relevant.Nicolas has been very faithful the house’s pop-futurist DNA, riffing on early 60s checks; cut-outs and uber white trapeze coats and dresses. Yet the result never looked literal or hackneyed.
 
His super-hero silhouette for guys; and retro space-age lines for gals managed to be contemporary. What rock star wouldn’t want to wear the white sleeveless Nehru logo jacket with the AC logo? Or gal, the black patent leather version with funnel neck.
 
Above all, one doesn’t get the sense of a designer trapped in the archives, or that Nicolas is trying too hard. Nothing feels forced.
 
And as someone who remembers actually meeting an about to retire André Courrèges, and marvelling at his bonhomie and pride, this new direction at the house would have made the founder proud.
 
Unveiled on the house’s Instagram account, and staged on an unsmiling cast, this was the best styled collection so far in Paris. Full marks to Marie Chaix.
 
And to the smart guys who hired Nicolas di Felice.

"Jun 24, 2021","Victoria Beckham unveiled her pre-spring collection this week in an important turning point for her fashion house, as it represents her first unified collection in several years.
 
The UK house has amalgamated its two main lines - Victoria by Victoria Beckham and Victoria Beckham – into one signature collection and also recalibrated its price point, to ease any hesitation at the cash register.
 
A strategic move that comes in the midst of a strategic pivot for the house, which suffered red ink for several years, but now seems poised to return to profitability.Beckham has also enjoyed rapid success in her own beauty business launched in October 2019, which is fully owned by the company and not a license, whose growth is based on direct-to-consumer sales. 
 
Beckham has long been a darling of the global fashion media, and as a designer has generally garnered very positive reviews from more sophisticated critics. However, her fashion houses had struggled to turn her talent, international renown and energy into a burgeoning business. In the latest year for which figures are available, as registered in Company House, her house scored annual revenues of £38.3 million, and a loss of £16.6 million as it underwent fairly radical restructuring.However, those figures look about to change, under the guidance of a new CEO Marie Leblanc de Reynies, Chairman Ralph Toledano and the backing of the experienced French luxury vehicle NEO Investment Partners.
 
So, we caught up with the ever poised Victoria and her CEO for a deeper look at the new fashion and management approach.
 
“We think of it as this as a rebirth. We are very excited about this collection as we have put Victoria by Victoria Beckham and Victoria Beckham into one cohesive collection, with a more accessible entry price point. To me this is a sweet spot,” explained Beckham, her hair puled back in a chignon.
 
In the process, the house will create just four collections a year with careful drops, as opposed to eight before.

“It feels like a modem way of dressing after the last 18 months of lockdown. Our consumers made us realize that they wanted ease. Everything changed in the way we dressed in the pandemic. But by comfort I don’t means track suits that you wear to the gym. So, we have beautiful long jerseys dresses; a relaxing silhouette in the trousers; powerful suits; and strong femininity that runs through our 90s-inspired dresses, looking effortlessly cool,” smiled Victoria, attired in a crisp grey cashmere sweater.
 
Added, Leblanc de Reynies: “What we wanted to achieve is a beautiful design aesthetic at an affordable price price point.”
 
Noted the CEO, before Victoria Beckham had an average price point of £900, while Victoria by Victoria Beckham was around £300. In future, the core items will be £300 to £700 – with separates at £400 and a full look from £1000 to £1300.
 
“Our goal is to offer designer luxury at a realistic price point,” stressed Leblanc de Reynies.  
The first drop of the unified marque will be end-November, with other drops through to end-January, though the collection will have a six-month duration on the floor.
 
“Before I struggled to know where would I go for affordable luxury for designer clothes – so we see this as a sweet spot. Plus, people constantly compliment us on the execution of the garments, which is great,” she nods.
 
Beckham also began working with a female stylist, Jane How, “which we never did before.” Her classy new look book, shot in Regency-mansion splendour, will be used in the brand’s own website and by e-tailers. Beckham already works with the Gotha of fashion e-commerce – Moda Operandi, Matches, Net-a-Porter and MyTheresa.
 
Even as they eased the price point, however, the ladies have expanded the product mix into a more hybrid collection.
 
“More unbuttoned,” smiled Beckham. “Now women want to keep the ease yet remain feminine and elegant. And we plan to support them with full range offer.”
 
Like many houses feeling their way out of the covid crisis, Beckham is cautious about returning to the catwalk.
 
“I don’t know if a show in September feels appropriate. I’d still like to do a small personal show in London – a luxurious collection in a luxurious environment. But not a big show for the next few seasons,” she confesses.

A mum of four, Beckham impressively manages to juggle family and career, even taking the kids on the school run. In her own clothes, bien sûr, often donning her collab’ collection with Reebok.
 
“It is something we have done for couple of years and I talk a lot about. It’s been a big success during the pandemic. I work out every single day – so we had lots of fun making proper work out clothing that is functional and looks good enough to go on school runs.  David or I still do the school run,” shrugs Victoria, though eldest son Brooklyn now lives in LA and Romeo is about to move to Florida, where his dad has his own MLS soccer club, Inter Miami.After a taxing couple of years, the ex-Spice Girl seems in a buoyant mood, especially as her beauty business has flourished.
 
“It’s been a great strategy to go direct-to-consumer, with a strong focus on sustainability and clean formulas,” she beams.
 
“Our beauty broke even at one-year-old. We’ve had an enormous success,” added Leblanc de Reynies of the project that ranges from skincare to beauty to makeup. With the U.S. its biggest market, followed by the UK, France and Germany.
 
“We have enjoyed focusing on the social side and communicating with our community. It’s like two daughters - a fashion daughter and beauty daughter,” the designer laughs.
 
Next up, this spring they are pre-launching shoes and then working on leather goods for next fall winter. They have inked a shoe license with Hom Co, which also handles Proenza Schouler, Chloé and J W Anderson.
 
“So Victoria Beckham will become a full lifestyle and luxury brand,” insists the ex-Posh Spice. “I have 29 million followers on Instagram that I can reach out to immediately. So I think our opportunities are vast. There are so many things we can do.”
 
Asked for a time frame for a return to the black, the CEO responds: “We are very much on track. It was clearly impossible in 2020 due to the pandemic, but we resisted well. And we were on the right trend, as we halved losses from 2019.  So, in next couple of years we shall be in the right place,” she insisted looking at Beckham.
 
Who then added from her Mayfair store: “I feel very lucky to be working with Marie and have someone like her by my side. I could not be more excited about the future.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 23, 2021","The visual image of Prada’s models exiting from a long red tunnel-catwalk directly onto a beach will remain the symbol of the latest Milan fashion week. Judging from their collection films, designers believe in the future, and hope to have finally reached the end of the tunnel. But a return to normality is still some way off. In a city that was virtually uninhabited - the Milanese fled en masse from the weekend’s stifling heat - and had been shunned by international buyers, the atmosphere wasn’t exactly festive during this fashion week dedicated to the menswear collections for Spring/Summer 2022.With the fashion industry still in very low gear owing to the pandemic, and an almost entirely virtual show calendar, except for Etro, Dolce & Gabbana and Giorgio Armani, the only labels to show in front of a live audience, the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) could hardly expect a miracle. “This was clearly a transitional fashion week. It marked a new departure, since we have finally been able to start seeing and talking to each other in person,” CNMI President Carlo Capasa told FashionNetwork.com, underlining that “revenue for the Italian fashion industry fell by 24% in 2020, and is forecast to start making up for lost ground by growing 17% this year.”

Capasa also said that “showrooms in particular were open and busy during the week in Milan. For the current sales campaign, they expect at least 70% of the orders they’ll receive to be placed in person, as opposed to between 10% and 20% last year.” A number of buyers from Russia and eastern European countries did make the trip, and likewise other Europeans, like Michael Kliger, CEO of German luxury e-tailer Mytheresa, seen at the Giorgio Armani show.There was a palpable yearning for a return to normal life in the majority of the collection videos, most of them quite short this season, running on average to around three minutes. They featured a profusion of bodies in motion, dancing and promenading, often with slow-motion effects, and long frenzied dashes in search of the open country, to flee the claustrophobia of enclosed spaces.

Like for example Prada’s red tunnel, Zegna’s labyrinth, Diesel’s catwalk-lift and David Catalan’s goods elevator. At Jeda, the models were catapulted from a dark night club right in the middle of a forest. At Magliano, garments literally took flight and twirled around the model's bodies, which were lashed by the blast of a windmill-sized fan.Not to mention the aquatic element, especially the Mediterranean Sea, which added a luminous, sensual touch to the collections. Especially when models plunge into the water fully clothed, as at Prada and MSGM, while at Numero 00 they have time to shed their clothes, and at Zegna they simply dip their feet and legs in a fountain. Federico Cina extolled his childhood’s Adriatic beaches in Romagna, and Andrea Pompilio for Harmont & Blaine did the same for the bay of Naples, with a show at Castel dell’Ovo, a medieval castle standing right by the waterside.

It was very much a question of enjoying nature and dolce far niente in the sunshine. In the collections, this translated in pastel colour palettes with plenty of tie-dye effects and fabrics that looked sun-bleached or, conversely, in explosions of radiant colours. Designers favoured total looks, in which even shoes and socks are colour-coordinated with the clothes. Different items are featured in the same hues, to be mixed ‘n matched at will, as dictated in the new menswear wardrobe designed by Zegna’s Creative Director Alessandro Sartori.

Streetwear and formal wear blend in a new type of garment, at once elegant and comfortable, classic and casual, essential and chic. Cuts and proportions have been redesigned to soften and lighten up the silhouette. Shirts are worn unbuttoned, jackets morph into overshirts, and shorts are never inelegant.

These collections will arrive in-store next summer, when the fashion market is expected to be in full recovery. Hence, designers have calibrated them very carefully, focusing chiefly on commercial, evergreen high-quality clothes.

"Jun 22, 2021","Paris Menswear Week opened with a slow boil on Tuesday, with no live shows, but two impressive collections, and videos, by Wales Bonner and Lanvin.Wales BonnerA former LVMH Prize winner,  Grace Wales Bonner carved out a great reputation in early collections for creating rather majestic tailoring that referenced and immortalized her parents’ cultures in Africa and the Caribbean.
 
However, in recent seasons, her emphasis has been far more focused on streetwear, albeit with a dreamily romantic disposition.This season her sunny island show video was directed by Joshua Woods and featured sensitive youths at ease in soft streetwear styles – V-neck cricket sweaters with matching shorts; rust suede jackets; white T-shirts with loose necklines; drawstring linen pyjama pants. Her graphic T-shirts even included some French, one reading Reviens à Moi Chouchou ('Come back to me sweetheart'); while an old red transistor radio captured the retro mood. 
And just when it got a little too casual, Wales Bonner whipped up a great ecru linen suit with high lapels and contrasting striped sleeves. Plus, the designer introduced a neat WB logo, sewn into banded collar shirts. While her collab with Adidas also featured in slim sneakers worn in an impromptu football match.
 
Entitled Volta Jazz, the video and collection was a homage to West African studio portraiture and in particular the work of artist Sanlé Sony in the 1970s in Burkina Faso, then known as Upper Volta. The result, another memorable display by Wales Bonner, a designer who never disappoints.


 LanvinWith Paris terraces newly reopened and masks no longer obligatory, the mood is suddenly carefree in the capital, which made the latest video from Lanvin seemed very prescient.
 
Opening with a gang of frenzied hair and makeup artists pampering a pouting young beauty backstage. The lady, however, is far more interested in her iPhone and images of beach huts and island vacations.
 
Which is where one is suddenly transported with loop-the-loop camera angles inside a tropical party hut; the inclusive cast in this co-ed show surviving the steamy tropics  in floral silk dresses and tops; pleated mini-skirts or scuba jerseys with organza trims for the gals. While the after-hours surfer boyfriends looked devilishly dapper in  russet check rude-boy suits; marvellous mash-up printed cyclist tops; or giddy summer floral shirts finished with bursting-heart Lanvin symbols.At times, Lanvin’s talented designer Bruno Sialelli can let his concepts take over his collections. Happily not this season, where the sense of kicky color and stylish exuberance was attractive and commercially plausible. His blend of Jeanne Lanvin florals and Antonio Castillo costume drama proving an inspired cocktail – best captured as the cast began boozing on cocktails around a bemused parrot.
 
All shown to that great upbeat anthem Pure Shores by All Saints, this video captured the sense of release one feels in Paris after the pent-up pandemic. With Sialelli suddenly appearing at the finale saying gently, ‘Lila, wake up darling,’ to rouse the model from her reverie.
 
Hard to beat the giddy optimism of youth.

"Jun 22, 2021","Milan Men's Fashion Week wrapped up Tuesday, following Giorgio Armani's first live runway show since coronavirus that opened the door to a return to normality for the industry.""Back where it all began"" was the name chosen by Armani, 86, for his latest men's collection shown late Monday before a live audience.

It was a fitting description for the industry hoping to see the end of a punishing period of dismal sales and audience-free shows caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.Combining fluidity of movement with extreme elegance, the Men's Spring/Summer 2022 collection was presented in the courtyard of Armani's Milan headquarters near the city's fashion district, with models -- both with and without masks -- making their way down a runway in front of the well-manicured lawn.Bold floral graphics in black and white adorned light knitwear or pants, blouson jackets were relaxed and roomy, while Bermuda shorts -- some in tribal indigo blue, grey and red prints -- were paired with vests or jackets.

""My new collection reflects my state of mind after the pandemic. It is very classic in a sense, but also informal and relaxed,"" Armani told journalists after the show.

""And of course, I wanted the collection to bear my trademark, a certain effortless elegance,"" he added.

The Italian luxury house was the first to announce the return of live audiences in May this year, after being the first to renounce them in February 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis.

Fashion experts have described the live shows as an important sign of recovery for the Italian fashion industry, where revenue fell by 26 percent last year. Pre-pandemic sales levels are only expected to be regained in 2022.

"Jun 22, 2021","Ever since Milan Fashion Week adopted a digital format, it has become more international in outlook. As shown by the busy calendar of the current menswear fashion week, featuring scores of labels from around the world, notably Tíscar Espadas and Mans from Spain, Franc Elis and Zenam from Africa, and 424 from California, all of them worthy of a close look.424, from Californian cool to Italian tailoring
 
Californian label 424 is maturing, and is appearing for the first time on a fashion week calendar. Designer Guillermo Andrade has chosen Milan for his debut, after inking a distribution deal with Italian company 380group. 424’s Spring/Summer 2022 collection is presented in a short video, showing Californian artist Reggie waking up and getting dressed under the viewer’s gaze, and trying to pick a look suitable for his day.Guatemala-born Andrade launched 424 in 2015, five years after setting up multibrand fashion retailer FourTwoFour in Los Angeles’s Fairfax district. A cult streetwear label, 424 has evolved more markedly this season towards a couture wardrobe, featuring double-breasted jackets, classic yet comfortable suits and shirts, matched with jeans, jersey essentials or a varsity-style jacket. The garments are nicely cut from quality materials, with a laid-back feel to them.
 
“I kept trying to find my own voice, though there was always something missing. But now I have a clear idea of what I want to show and share. I feel the time is right,” said Andrade in a press release, explaining why he has chosen Milan. Worth noting the quirky boots and sneakers, once again a collaboration with Adidas. 
 Mans's softened tailoring

Designer Jaime Álvarez has unveiled for Mans a colourful, exuberant and uber-fresh collection called ‘Summer Camp’, at once imaginative and classical. Álvarez, who borrowed part of his German grandfather’s name Demans for the Mans Concept Menswear label he founded in 2018, takes his audience on a countryside jaunt in a short film showing a gang of extravagant lads whose cool, retro charm has more than a touch of the eccentric.

Álvarez was born in La Luisiana, near Seville, and studied at the Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) in Madrid, where he is now based. He specialised as a tailor, and his collection indeed features a wide range of impeccably cut suits and classic men’s garments, infused with a light-hearted, nonchalant mood, bursting with bright colours and psychedelic prints.

The silhouettes are soft, with their comfy, relaxed fit and their youthful, summery touch. Mans’s classic jackets have an understated architecture, and jettison their habitual slim-fit cuts to morph into more comfortable overshirts. The shirts, like the jackets, are generously cut, worn over trim Bermuda shorts. Knitwear is lightweight, made with airy, flowing fabrics. The emphasis is on quality garments made in Spain.Tíscar Espadas reinvents the suit

Like her compatriot Álvarez, designer Tíscar Espadas studied at IED in Madrid. Her collection is unveiled in a video clip narrating an open-country romp, as she visits a ranch’s estate with three friends. The film’s sepia tones heighten the retro mood of the collection, which features all the great menswear classics, only to reinvent them completely in a complex play of tailoring architecture, volumes and details.

Espadas is also an illustrator and was born in Úbeda, Andalusia. She studied at the Royal College of Art in London, thanks to a scholarship funded by Burberry, and in 2019 she set up her menswear label in the UK capital. The label is now distributed via some 15 multibrand retailers in Japan.

In the summer 2022 collection, Espadas has once again focused on artisanal techniques and craftsmanship, paying close attention to details and to the garments’ finishings, from the choice and arrangement of buttons to the plethora of frills, draped effects, laces, flaps and layering. White is the wardrobe’s dominant colour, enlivened by a series of wacky accessories, from pointed, elf-style woollen hats and bonnets to knee-high socks in thick red wool.Zenam’s made-in-Italy Afro-couture

Zenam is styled by Cameroonian designer Paul Roger Tanonkou. The clothes are all made in Milan, where Tanonkou’s atelier is based, thanks to the support of Pluvial Ventures, a start-up incubator for migrants founded by Gaia Trussardi and Alex Legler. Self-taught Tanonkou has a degree in computer science and started out in fashion in 2004 with Zenam, an ethical, sustainable menswear label. Zenam’s summer 2022 collection is ostensibly genderless, though it mostly consists of suits and shirts.

In the Bamileke language of Cameroon, ‘zenam’ means ‘sunbeam’, a moniker certainly embodied by this highly colourful, print-rich collection, overflowing with traditional African motifs - masks, ethnic micro patterns and floral designs - on soft, lightweight cotton fabrics and crisp, fresh poplin in warm colours, a collection that simply oozes fluidity and joy. 
Franc Elis, the art of detail

Cuts and details to the fore, from buttonholes to appliqué, from pockets, to braids and trimmings, at the show by Franc Elis, filmed at the label’s headquarters in Johannesburg. The label was launched in 2003 by the eponymous South African producer, well-known for its shirts. It is designed by Fabrice Moyo who, like Tanonkou of Zenam, enjoys the backing of Afro Fashion Association, the not-for-profit organisation founded in Italy by Michelle Francine Ngonmo.

For the Spring/Summer 2022, Franc Elis presented a series of monochrome suits, occasionally decorated with geometric inserts, in a matt colour palette ranging from sky blue to jade green, ochre, coral red and khaki. The garments are made in denim or cotton twill, and feature revised silhouettes with more contemporary, comfier cuts, associated with fine shirts in colourful printed African fabrics.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 22, 2021","Dolce & Gabbana lit up Milan on Saturday, as the luxury label celebrated its return to the runway with a show that sparkled with the glittering colours of the night. Entitled ""DG Light Therapy,"" the brand's menswear collection for Spring/Summer 2022 took inspiration from the tradition of artistic light shows in southern Italy, but also from the aesthetic of the 2000s, surfing the current wave of nostalgia for the first decade of this millennium, a trend that is particularly popular with Gen Z, the label's clear target audience for several seasons now. It's not the first time that the typical light shows of Mezzogiorno have inspired fashion. A year ago, Maria Grazia Chiuri made them the central theme of her Cruise 2021 collection for Dior, revealed in Lecce, Apulia, in a show held behind closed doors due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana already mined this particular seam of inspiration themselves in 2011, for their Spring/Summer 2012 womenswear collection. On Saturday they created the same illuminated wonderland, setting up aches, gateways and rosettes covered in multicoloured bulbs that reflected off the mirrored runway for a dazzling interplay of lights.The overriding atmosphere was that of a party backed up by a techy night club soundtrack. Festoons of lights were reimagined in a series of dark-hued pieces, which were brightened up with vibrant decorations, as well as in knitwear, jackets, trousers, shoes and even a bucket hat practically sagging under the weight of multicoloured stones.

Ripped denim looks and white outfits were also decorated with precious adornments in a thousand colours, gilt embroidery, silvery metallic accessories and pearls. Even the briefs were embroidered with gemstones, which also appeared in the side bands of trousers and exploded like sparkling fireworks across a black tulle top, while crystals decorated the collars of t-shirts like a fine lace. It was all about sparkle, but the collection's link with the light shows ran deeper. The designers also picked up on the motifs and patterns of the illuminations, particularly the vibrant, sun-like rosettes, which they reproduced in prints on loose short-sleeved shirts or reworked in treatments featuring blurred photos, seen on silk pyjamas that were matched with flowing dressing gowns for guaranteed optical impact. 

On top of this, the designers added flashy jewellery, including brooches pinned onto the lapels of elegant dark-toned velvet jackets and cascades of chains and necklaces, which jangled together over sensual shirts, which were left unbuttoned down to the navel. This sexy edge could also be seen in transparent pieces and the revealing gaps of loose knits, as well as in fishnet t-shirts and both trousers and tops made from lace. 

The creative duo even went so far as to place veritable prince crowns on the heads of certain models, who were humorously dressed in sports ensembles – shorts, football shirts and tracksuits – featuring the green, white and red of the Italian flag, a cheeky nod to Euro 2020, where the Squadra Azzurra just qualified for the round of 16.

"Jun 21, 2021","Fashion likes nothing more than a debut, and the biggest one in Italy this season was designer Glenn Martens at Diesel, the avant-garde Belgian designer, making some bold moves at the Italian streetwear giant. 
Martens, 38, unveiled his first full collection for the house in a show video on Monday, presented on the official calendar of Milan men's fashion week runway season.
 
Instead of a show, Martens organized a dream-like eight-minute film to express his vision of Diesel – one with an overriding choice of raw material – denim.Blessed with youthful beauty, his cast begins by dancing around a private loft party to acid techno chords courtesy of Leon Vynehall. All of them look very cool; in dozens of denim ideas – decayed, distressed, damaged and delightful, in a punchy opening statement.
  
“Few brands have as much global impact as Diesel. And its key material is denim, the most important fabric in the world. When you put the two together you have the power to sell to anyone no matter the region, country, sexual identity or paycheck. Diesel is very democratic. That’s why I accepted this job. It is not just making some pretty dresses. Diesel is a way more a social project than just fashion,” insisted a clearly energized Martens in a pre-show Zoom. 
Further into his video, his raven-haired heroine leads her troupe along a street scene – couples meeting and embracing before reaching an elevator into which the preternaturally self-assured youths marched in some marvelous parachute fabric constructions  and concoctions.
 
Martens continually creates in eco-responsible denim, including an upcycled capsule – made in organza from Diesel’s own stock – then cracked and embalmed. Or playing with denim bonded with organza in dramatic coats; or even bonding cardboard packing material to denim in another risky play that nonetheless worked.
 
“Diesel never did conceptual garments before, so I had expected to cancel out lots of looks. But in the end, so many of the garments referenced rock, so I decided to include them all,” he cackles.
 
Martens sees Diesel, a billion-euro brand, as very much part of pop culture from MTV, and he respects the labels roots in backstage attire and after-party excess. 
However, what’s great about the collection is the way he takes Diesel somewhere new – like using trompe l’oeil in archive looks - in easily the best collection for the house in many years. He also harnessed his new concept eco-responsible Diesel Library to whip up some craftily  constructed askew clubbing gear; sexy jeans; or natty billowing gaucho denim jeans with matching boots.
 
“In 2021, we have to be aware the world is fucked up and we have to change. Library is a core money maker of the brand – and now all cotton treatments are certified. Our supply chain is fully controlled to make a very clean product,” insists Martens, who has worked at Diesel’s headquarters in the Veneto region. Though he now plans to move the design studio to Milan this month. 
Martens even printed QR codes inside certain garments, “so you can see when you go to the toilet that we are truly committed to the environment! You know, my parent was a single mother, who worked as a cleaning lady at weekend to raise my brother and I.  And she did not give a shit about the environment. She didn’t have time to worry about sustainability. And that’s true of many people. So there is a message in our garments to help raise awareness,” explains Martens.
 
In a sense this collection also marked the decision of Renzo Rosso, Diesel’s founder and billionaire owner, to loosen the creative reins. Giving Martens carte blanche in the key brand of his growing fashion empire, whose holding company Only The Brave controls Marni, Maison Margiela and Viktor & Rolf.
 
“I want people to think they can find fun at Diesel. That’s the Only The Brave identity. Irony is intrinsic to this brand. Diesel was very well run for a long time, but it’s a big company and maybe was on automatic pilot. Being from outside I have a chance to bring a fresh eye,” he concludes.

"Jun 21, 2021","With Paris finally exiting the lockdown, and Parisians enjoying their city without masks, the international menswear runway season reaches its climax with six days of shows here this week, albeit still within the penumbra of Covid. 
After a weekend in London earlier this month bereft of any actual live physical shows; and four days in Milan with just four shows, Paris will stage six actual live runway shows. From the following brands:  Hermès, Dior Men, Bluemarble, Officine Générale, Casablanca and LGN Louis-Gabriel Nouchi.
 
With 73 brands listed on the official calendar of the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the organization controlling all runway seasons in Paris,  the menswear season debuts on Tuesday at 3.30 p.m. with the critically acclaimed Wales Bonner, a former LVMH Prize winner and one of the most inventive tailors in Europe; before finishing Sunday 7 p.m. with 1017 Alyx 9SM, from designer Matthew Williams who founded the house at 9 St Mark’s Place, in the ever hip Lower East Side.Moreover, 20 brands will stage presentations with some sort of physical presence, when invited guests can meet designers in showrooms and see clothes on live models.
 
“In effect, even if we are still dealing with this enormous health crisis, Paris Fashion Week has always managed to hold its line, in terms of presenting important and creative brands and designers. I think many international brands believe if you want to have international impact you need to come to Paris. And that is also true for women’ wear,” said Pascal Morand, executive vice president of the Federation.Several major houses will again be missing from the Paris menswear calendar: Comme des Garcons, Junya Watanabe, Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent. However, Paris has suffered notably far less seepage than Milan or London.
 
“I don’t want to make a polemic but the vast majority of brands have stayed faithful. Obviously the health crisis has been a great problem, but it led to great innovation. It’s led to every brand creating a presence online with great results. Figures show that Paris  is also the digital capital of fashion. Paris has really connected with the digital revolution, which maybe it had not done so much before,” added Morand.
 
Two other brands featuring menswear – Jacquemus and Off-White - will stage events in between the menswear season and Paris haute couture season, which kicks off on July 5. Via Instagram, Jacquemus has revealed that it will stage an event named La Montagne on July 30, whose collection will be immediately available online; while Off-White plans a Paris show on Sunday, July 4, fittingly for an American designer in Paris. 
The Federation recently released a double-header series of eco-initiatives, working with PricewaterhouseCoopers and accredited houses. It is both to calculate how each brand’s show can reduce its environmental impact upstream and to measure the social and environmental impact of actually producing each collection.
 
“It’s a project we launched pre-Covid in the end of 2019. With people and houses committed to durable economic development. It’s a strict partnership with brands and members. And right now we are in prelaunch phase,” stressed Morand.
 
The concept is that each brand will respond anonymously to the study and that all the results will be collected to provide an honest answer about the ecological impact of Paris Fashion Week. Results will be released in September, before the next women’s ready-to-wear season which debuts here on Sep. 27.
 
Looking ahead, Morand predicted that the September season “will be largely physical, naturally with the strictest sanitary measures,” with about 100 brands doing shows and presentations.
 
This week’s Paris season also marks the first with a new president of the menswear section of the Federation, Elsa Lanzo, the CEO of Rick Owens. The highly influential Californian designer will stage his own show at 12.30 p.m. on Thursday. Like his past couple of seasons, creating a live event with models in Venice – where he now resides – that will be streamed online. 
“Yes, we are in Venice, but we are still very much on the Paris menswear calendar. Sanitary measures prevent us from physically showing in Paris, so we will again do a live digital show like before. That way everyone can see it via streaming.  There is no public invited, but as we stage it in public spaces in Venice, we expect many Venetians to actually see it. Like last time, people out for a stroll or riding their bicycles on the Lido in the middle of winter were surprised to witness our show.  It was actually kind of magical,” recalled Lanzo.
 
Like Morand, she is firmly convinced of the need to return to a fully live fashion season model.
 
“We are still in a Covid moment, so even if you don’t have to wear masks on the streets in Paris and the city has opened up, it was last-minute for many houses to stage live shows. However, I am sure that in September there will be an essentially live season. That is what we are planning at Rick Owens. So, I believe if nothing dramatic happens – and who knows about the impact of the Delta variant? -  September will be back to normal,” argued Lanzo.
 
“Fashion weeks are institutions that I firmly believe we are all waiting to go back to. Streaming is fantastic as you connect to many more people, but for buyers, journalists and your own team you need that moment of celebration of a fashion season,” the Rick Owens CEO concluded.

"Jun 21, 2021","Few indie fashion brands manage to combine creative gusto with commercial savvy as well as A-Cold-Wall, the UK label that presented its latest collection in Milan on Monday. 
Unveiled in a moody show video shot before skyscrapers and industrial warehouses, the collection fitted into the current zen for hyper logomania - from elongated varsity scarves and nylon bags to raised-lettering sweatshirts and chunky tops, the brand name was pretty much everywhere.
 
A-Cold-Wall is the brainchild of designer Samuel Ross, whose great gift is to impart a certain modern nobility to traditional working class clobber – from stonewashed T-shirts to color-blocked parkas.This season Ross’s big advance was in his color palette, working subtly from burnt yellows and washed-out lichens to sherbet blues and mottled burgundies. His models strutting around the urban landscape, most of them carrying nylon shoulder bags or mountaineer’s pouches, in a video shot with precision by director Will Dohrn. 
In barely a half decade, Ross has developed a highly specific style for A-Cold-Wall - always a sign of a coherent brand. Whatever trick he tries, from techy plissé tops to matelassé vests and waistcoats they all have that A-Cold-Wall-cool and DNA. So much so that the entire cast looked part of some insider downtown club that you hoped would extend an invitation.
 
A man of few words, Ross’ press release for the show was just four orders: Motion, Form, Oscillate, Converge.
 
In short, a thoroughly convincing collection by a designer who seems certain to have a very successful future – and on his own terms.

"Jun 20, 2021","Light-hearted logomania at Prada, where the arrival of Raf Simons alongside Miuccia Prada has led to multiple expressions of the brand’s signature crest. 
Most notably on Sunday in the latest menswear show video from the Milan fashion house, whose opening image was the back of a youth wearing a black nylon jerkin and golf hat, each bearing a logo – on his back the rope-enclosed logo; on the hat the signature inverted triangular metallic version. When seen from the front, the model completed his look with micro shorts, black socks and matching town-shoes.
 
The next look, topped by a samurai version of the golfer hat, also boasted a pocket logo at the back. Over-the-shoulder bags – in a cut reminiscent of As Four – came embossed with a blown-up logo – Prada Milano.Indeed, the overriding message was logos – seen on mini leather bucket totes, pink sweatshirts, and miniature cable-knit breastplate sweaters. One recalls that in Raf’s first collab with Miuccia, they turned the logo triangle into an earring. 
When it came to tailoring, the jackets were far less abbreviated – so much so that they ended well below the micro shorts with which they were paired.
 
Back when she was still a single designer, Miuccia preferred multicultural musical mashups courtesy of sound architect Frédéric Sanchez. Now that she is hitched up with Simons, a fan of techno, the soundtrack this season was gurgling industrial beats. Which somehow did not seem terribly Prada.In a great visual sleight of hand, the cast initially marched in a brick red passage, before suddenly exiting this temporary work of land art and strolling onto a Mediterranean beach. Again the key look was micro shorts worn beneath Super 100 wool blazers – rolled up to the elbow, disco dragoon style. Just weeks after Netflix paid homage to Halston with the launch of its new series.

Highlights for Spring/Summer 2022 at Prada included rather divine leather after-hours rock-star biker jackets in yellow or red; a great series of stencil-pattern summer shirts, and graphic beach party tops, worn with matching fabric bags and loafers. Which the boys then wore into the sea, jumping about on bright red floating docks in the water. 
All told, this was a perfectly competent collection, which felt, however, as if it were made by two designers trying too hard to be commercial. Quite frankly, the concept of marrying two such major fashion design leaders as Miuccia and Raf has not led to any kind of explosion of ideas, more a plethora of logos. The creative yeast has still yet to really rise in their collective cake.
 
As a result, the show and collection felt, well, rather flat.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 19, 2021","Fendi’s invitation to its Spring/Summer 2022 collection, unveiled Saturday, classily telegraphed its designer’s message: a sophisticated ode to the Eternal City and its fashionable dolce far niente sense of style. 
Artistic Director of Accessories and Menswear Silvia Fendi staged her show video at Fendi’s world headquarters in Rome, the famed Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, a marvelous multi-arched expression of Rationalist architecture.
 
Or rather on top of the palazzo, seeing as the cast marched all the way up to the roof, and strolled around with sunset skies in the background, touring the circumference in polished patrician tailoring and abbreviated jackets, behind them the Alban Hills and Castel Gandolfo, the summer residence of the pope. Silvia’s invitation was as subtle as the clothes – a hand-drawn map of the Eternal City in some great pistachio, mauve and putty shades, featuring the river Tiber and the Fendi headquarters – the same print seen billowing in silk pants and cool shorts during the show.
 
In another clever trompe-l’oeil she morphed silk shorts into mock centurion skirts with lots of mini pockets. Not that this was a remotely literal show or collection, since some of its best looks were Appaloosa-print denim jackets.
 
""Our singular point of view in this period has modified our perception of the world – and mine has become so linked to what I see from the arches and the rooftops of our building. It is almost like a bird’s eye view of Rome... The colors and the perspective are always changing – the soft palette of the Roman sky across the day is so beautiful and I wanted it to be the focal point of this collection,"" explained Silvia. 
As dusk fell, 15 youths perched on the marble roof’s edge; before darkness descended and the clothes became more tailored, and enveloping. From great translucent raincoats to camouflage cabans, the collection had enormous pizzazz, making for an impressive ode from Silvia to her hometown. Finally, she showed languid, softly tailored suits in dusty pastels, accessorizing looks with swimming goggles and caps.
 
And given her history of creating hit bags – La Silvia developed the immensely successful Fendi Baguette – it should come as no surprise that she dreamed up some great new totes, finished with a natty take on the reverse F logo of the brand, and even a micro Baguette on a thin waist chain.
 
Along with some great burnished leather briefcases, one boasting an exterior ping pong bat pocket, courtesy of a link-up with sportswear label Arena. One dude even held up a surf board, despite the fact that the famed Il Buco beach favored by young Roman hipsters has the tiniest of waves.
 
Silvia’s rooftop lotharios clearly loved the clothes – and the hats: several sported giant floppy wide brims. A number of chaps even wore micro tuxedos or blazers cut off at the chest, the better to display their flat-as-panache abs.

For Fendi’s two previous shows this year, only the house’s creative director for women’s fashion, Kim Jones, took a solo bow – both for haute couture in Paris and for women’s ready-to-wear in Milan, albeit in video formats. 
At the finale this weekend, only Silvia Fendi took a bow. For many years, she and Karl Lagerfeld had taken a joint bow at the end of every Fendi ready-to-wear show, a tradition ended since Jones arrival.
 
A brief appearance by Signora Fendi, but a proud one. Before we witnessed yet another splendid optical illusion. The exact hues of the collection projected onto the multiple high arches of the soaring palazzo, each arch containing a single model. 
 
In a word, Fendi’s strongest menswear statement in many seasons, and a triumph for Silvia Fendi, granddaughter of the label’s founders.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 19, 2021","Business is beginning to resume post-lockdown, and thanks to the vaccination drive’s acceleration, little by little fashion is returning to a certain degree of normality. As shown by the next round of menswear fashion weeks for the summer season, with a number of physical events on the cards, after the previous season was wholly virtual.

Three catwalk shows are scheduled in Milan, while Paris has announced six genuine shows with a live guest audience for its Spring/Summer 2022 menswear calendar. Plus the show by Jacquemus, scheduled on June 30 not far from the French capital.Jacquemus has announced its catwalk return with a co-ed show outside the French Fashion and Haute Couture Federation’s official calendar, presenting a collection that will be immediately available for purchase. The goal “is to maintain momentum between our presentation and the products’ availability. To us, this way of doing things seems more relevant, more realistic,” said Jacquemus in a brief note, indicating also that it now intends to be “less seasonal.” The show will give the label the chance to stage a “transition towards a more adaptable, modern, flexible approach.”

Entitled ‘La Montagne’, the new collection by Simon Porte Jacquemus, some of whose items have already been unveiled on the label’s Instagram account, will be presented at a yet undisclosed venue in the vicinity of Paris. In a similar spirit to the label's last show, which took place in July 2020 in a wheat field in the Oise valley, to the north-west of Paris.Paris Fashion Week Men’s official programme features 72 labels, with 39 catwalk shows on the calendar. A number of major names are absent, like Saint Laurent, which will show in Venice on July 14, Givenchy, Comme des Garçons, Junya Watanabe, Balenciaga and Ami, which has scheduled an online show on July 3, but the Parisian event can still count on the presence of several leading labels. Like Louis Vuitton, Issey Miyake, Lanvin, Yohji Yamamoto, Jil Sander, Dries Van Noten, Walter Van Beirendonck, Paul Smith, JW Anderson, Lemaire, Thom Browne, Y/Project and Vetements.

Dior Homme and Hermès are set to hold physical shows respectively on Friday June 25 and Saturday 26. The four other labels that are planning catwalk shows are LGN Louis-Gabriel Nouchi on June 24, Officine Générale on June 25, Casablanca on June 26, and Bluemarble, which will stage a presentation on Wednesday June 23.

With the exception of a handful of invitation-only events, most of the collections will be presented via online videos on the Federation’s website, as in recent seasons. Among the new names at this year’s Paris Fashion Week Men’s June edition there is Courrèges, making its return to menswear. The French label’s men's line had been launched in 1973 and then abandoned in 1986, with the exception of a few licensed items. Nicolas Di Felice, Courrèges’s new creative director, has designed a capsule collection for the occasion, to be unveiled on June 23.Four other labels making their Parisian debut are also on the presentation calendar. The first is Georges Wendell, on old, virtually unknown brand from Paris’s Sentier district, bought and relaunched in the midst of the pandemic by Pierre Kaczmarek, the young designer who founded Afterhomework. Then there is Mr. Saturday, founded in Toronto in 2017 by self-taught designer Joey Gollish, which has emerged via Canadian business incubator HXOUSE. Gollish loves music, and draws his inspiration from the club culture of the 70s and 80s.

The third label, Gravalot, was set up by Nigeria-born designer Onye Anuna after he moved from Lagos to London in 2014. His menswear is rooted in craftsmanship and sustainable solutions, and is described as an “expression of black culture” with a contemporary African style. Finally, Jan-Jan Van Essche is a Belgian designer who studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. He set up his own label in 2010, with a penchant for minimalism, snugly generous volumes and luxe materials.

After menswear, it will be the turn of Paris Haute Couture Week, scheduled on July 5-8 and notably featuring eight physical catwalk shows, by Dior, Azzaro Couture, Chanel, Giorgio Armani Privé, Balenciaga, Jean Paul Gaultier, Zuhair Murad and Vaishali S.

"Jun 19, 2021","Ermenegildo Zegna opened Milan Fashion Week Men's on Friday with one of the most successful collections to have come from Alessandro Sartori. Focusing more than ever on fabrics, treatments and manufacturing processes, the Piedmont-based luxury menswear label's creative director has been able to construct a wardrobe that is simultaneously elegant and wearable, all while remaining ultra-sophisticated. Zegna opted for a video presentation again this season, taking viewers on a fast-paced journey through a hedge maze and into a little-known Milanese neighbourhood built by Aldo Rossi in the 1960s and 70s. Surrounded by this deserted and imposing architectural scenery, the models, which included a dozen women, marched on until they found their way onto an open plaza in the shadow of Dominique Perrault's leaning towers, in Rho, on the outskirts of Milan. The video's conclusion saw the models taking their seats at a long table set up in the waters of a fountain, in order to joyfully toast their newfound freedom. 

Without exception, the silhouettes were monochrome, airy and fluid. The clothes, which looked to be as intangible as clouds, floated with ease on the models' bodies. Long coats and kimono-style jackets, cinched at the waist with a ribbon, billowed almost imperceptibly. Large overshirts accentuated the impression of lightness, not to mention the smooth matte-effect calfskin shirt-jackets which looked to be made of cotton from a distance.  Shirts, blouses and oversized t-shirts were worn with shorts and loose trousers, for looks which, like most of the outfits on show, were constructed tone on tone. When the shirts and jackets were tucked into trousers, the looks took on the appearance of jumpsuits. This impression was emphasised by an overarching workwear aesthetic that ran throughout this free and functional collection for Spring/Summer 2022, as seen in a range of pieces featuring maxi-pockets, for example. Sartori has continued his subtle reinterpretation of classic tailoring, resulting in a new menswear uniform that is more informal but no less luxurious and which, following months of quarantine and the boom in working from home, feels more relevant than ever. ""At the moment, it's probably easier to send strong new messages,"" said the designer. 

""A modular wardrobe with pieces that are multifunctional, light, wearable and comfortable is, without a doubt, much more attractive now, because the paradigms have changed,"" explained Sartori, who has actually been pursuing this ideal for a number of seasons. 
 
Dubbed ""The New Set,"" the latest collection from Ermenegildo Zegna wants to break once and for all with traditional menswear codes, replacing the blazer with the three-button linen jacket. Suits and white shirts are out. This new wardrobe for men is built around four categories: the new jacket or over t-shirt, knitwear, new trousers with a new kind of wearability, and sports shoes. ""The idea is to make all the pieces with the same colours and treatments so that you can match them as you like. It's the theme of the collection,"" explained the designer, who divided his latest offering into different chromatic modules: pastel pink, sand, tobacco, off white, blue and green. For further comfort, some polos and trousers were made with a new kind of knit.

""We used native wool from sheep bred in the Oasi Zegna, mixed with linen and silk. Two years ago, making this kind of material seemed impossible! We carry out research not only into design and craftsmanship, but also into fabrics. We consider knits to be important materials for the future, because they allow you to work on new constructions. They are becoming fabrics that can be used to make dresses and trousers,"" continued Sartori. 

The result is an aesthetically pared-down collection, which is nonetheless rich in detail, elaborate finishes and new technical solutions. Here, construction is king, with the clothes having been liberated from all superfluity, including linings and padding. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 18, 2021","Following its first digital runway show dedicated to sustainable fashion in October of last year, LA-based PR showroom agency Wear the Future is presenting Digital Cruise II “Earth Voyage”, a virtual show created in partnership with video game developer EA Games. 
Conceived as a reflection on the environmental issues that the fashion industry has been forced to face up to during the Covid-19 pandemic, the second Digital Cruise show brings together 15 sustainable brands. In order to underscore the environmentally engaged message of the event, the brands’ pieces will be worn by activist models.
 
“It came as a natural response to our true commitment to sustainable fashion to have activist models. We are in awe of them because they dedicate themselves to long term goals, which kind of goes counter-clock in the fashion industry,” explained Wear the Future founder Annabelle Azadé in a release. “They are part of the educational work that we are trying to provide through the art of fashion and we are grateful to work with so many talents!”Debuting on June 17, 2021, the see-now-buy-now digital runway show will also go live on the CFDA Runway360 website from July 1.
 
Furthermore, as part of the event’s partnership with the video game developer, all of the show designs will be digitally rendered in EA’s Covet Fashion app.
 
The collaboration therefore builds on the growing popularity of crossovers between fashion and video games. Brazilian flipflop brand Havaianas, for example, recently signed off on a phygital collaboration with hit battle royale game Fortnite, while Louis Vuitton has previously designed skins for mobile game League of Legends.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 18, 2021","Christian Dior unveiled a caryatid Cruise 2022 collection in Athens on Thursday evening, metaphysical mode by its creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, unveiled inside the city’s giant Panathenaic Stadium.
 
Her opening look was a sporty goddess in a body stocking underneath the cage of a crinoline, finished with an extended train. Marching down the marble steps of the immense stadium, before an orchestra led by the London pianist Oliver Coates. Everything illuminated by flaming braziers and arc lights. 
However, instead of a model, the opener turned out to be Ioanna Gika, the Los Angeles-based Greek artist, who had already collaborated with Chiuri on her 2018 Wild West cruise collection staged in the hills above LA. As fireflies smarmed around, Gika sang and recited a tone poem, to usher in the cast.
 
Chiuri’s concept was a brave one – blending active sport ideas with classic Grecian attire. Cerebral goddesses marching in sneakers and white chunky boots. Goddesses in techy fabric dresses, with draw strings; grommets and athletic silhouettes.Dior’s divinities strolling along the giant athletic track in multiple modernist peplums; or technical fabric himations. In assemblages of perforated polyamide or plissé cashmere.
 
Hipster Hellenistic heroines – all the way to a brunette beauty in a white boxing robe paired with Chiuri’s latest Chic totes. The single most influential luxury bag of the past half decade.
 
Drone shots illustrated how the crafty lighting meant each model cast 50-meter-long shadows, in rather brilliant staging.
 Though blessed with acute curiosity and highly developed cultural antennae, Chiuri is also very loyal. Her producer, hatter, casting, hair and makeup teams remained unchanged from previous shows. All of them in fine fettle.
 
Notably Stephen Jones, who visited the Benaki Museum in Athens, and maintained Chiuri’s tradition of working with skilled local artisans on all her cruise collections. The result was a series of great sea captain’s caps, worthy of any descendant of Ulysses, or Aristotle Onassis.
 
A telling fashion moment that also included sensational micro pearl-rimmed eyes from the ever resourceful make-up artist Peter Philips; and ever so faintly disheveled corn-row hairstyles from Guido Palau. Once again, Chiuri’s astute choice of cohorts create trends, as this collection will assuredly will.
 
Originally built in 330 BC, the stadium was also the site of the first modern Olympics in 1896, and of the Athens Olympics of 2004, the stadium has a capacity of 65,000. This evening, due to Covid, there were some 300 souls in the audience, though their very scarcity added to the sense of event.
 
As a teenager in Rome, born to a father from Puglia, the heel of Italy, Chiuri is by definition a child of Magna Grecia, the extended area in the Italian peninsula from its heel to its toe to Sicily that was colonized 2,500 years ago by Greeks.Helping her to coolly revive antique ideas in this collection even as she subverted them with Breton fishermen striped tops; cunning matelassé black leather versions of fencing waistcoats; and very cool boyfriend’s white cabans. All told, power pop Marlene Dietrich.
 
Chiuri’s other big idea was playing on Giorgio De Chirico’s metaphysical painting, with its huge distances and empty vistas.  An ideal setting for this excellent collection. One featuring bold dramatic dresses, featuring Pierre Ruffo’ bravura silhouette stencil sketches on sexy tunics. All the way to a silvery, shimmering, broken metallic, oft-kilter hounds-tooth finale of red carpet must-haves.
 
That said, despite her huge influence on contemporary fashion, the Roman-born Chiuri is still perhaps not a universally loved figure in Paris fashion circles. In part, this is precisely because she is such a major commercial success. There remains a tradition on French circles to adore a noble failure. The exact opposite of Chiuri.
 
One ended recalling the famous lines of poet William Butler Yeats about Helen, the greatest beauty of the Ancient World, in his sonnet No Second Troy.
 
""With a beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern.
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?""

Fireworks burst out in the Athenian sky at the end. Phalanxes of models marched along the track, painted to look like chalk-stripe. Celebrating a gold-medal show and a gold-medal cruise collection.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 18, 2021","Hot on the heels of London Fashion Week Men's, starting Friday it's Milan's turn to unveil its menswear collections for Fall/Winter 2021-22. In contrast to last January, when almost the entirety of the programme took place online, this summer session is taking cautious steps back towards normality, with physical presentations, a few cocktail receptions and even three real runway shows.  
Dolce & Gabbana will show on Saturday 19 June, Etro on Sunday 20 June and Giorgio Armani on Monday 21 June, with two shows. Otherwise, we are still looking at an ultra-light fashion week of only four days. Stripped of many of its big names, excepting the three shows mentioned above and the videos expected from Fendi, Prada and Ermenegildo Zegna, who will open proceedings on Friday, Milan Fashion Week Men's will once again concentrate on young Italian design and new international names, most of which are little known by the general public. 

Running 18 to 22 June, this summer edition's calendar of physical and virtual shows features 47 names, versus the 39 that participated in the event last January. Including presentations, one of which will be the debut of trouser specialist PT Torino, the fashion week will bring together a total of 65 brands for a programme that is further complemented by 12 special events. Among the highlights, one unmissable rendez-vous is the first collection designed for Diesel by Glenn Martens, who is also creative director at Y/Project, set to show in Paris on 27 June. For the Italian jeans maker, the Belgian designer has come up with a collection ""for all genders,"" which will be revealed via a video. Another one to watch is the collection designed by Andrea Pompilio for Neapolitan brand Harmont & Blaine. The Italian designer has also been presenting menswear line APN73, launched in partnership with Chinese textile group JNBY, in Milan since last season. 

Other first-timers on Milan's virtual runway include two Spanish graduates of the Istituto Europeo de Design de Madrid. The first, Tíscar Espadas, is a designer and illustrator from Úbeda in Andalusia. Having studied at London's Royal College of Art with a scholarship from Burberry, Espadas decided to launch her menswear brand in the city in 2019. Her label is now distributed by some 15 Japanese multibrand retailers. 

The second, Jaime Alvarez, founded Mans Concept Menswear in Madrid in 2018 and quickly attracted attention at Barcelona Fashion Week thanks to his couture ""soft boy"" aesthetic, which reworks men's suiting in quality materials for a vibrant offering that is 100% made in Spain. The Milanese calendar also features two African brands: South Africa's Franc Elis, which was founded in Johannesburg as a manufacturer and supplier for other companies in 2003 and which specialises in shirting and chic cutting, and Cameroon's Paul Roger Tanonkou. This IT graduate and self-taught designer stepped onto the fashion scene in 2004 with Zenam, an ethical and sustainable menswear line made in Milan, where the creator established his atelier. The label mixes African traditions with Western couture. 

Joining these names is cult Californian streetwear brand 424, led by Los Angeles-born designer Guillermo Andrade, who cut his teeth opening a multibrand store before launching his own line in 2015. 

Finally, there are two new Italian names to discover: Revenant RVNT and KNT. Established in Florence in 2016, the former is a streetwear label launched by Tommaso Bencistà Falorni via design and communication firm TBF Limited, which he founded in 2011 with his brother, Andrea, who heads up operations. KNT is an urban line launched by historic Neapolitan tailor Kiton in 2018. The label's collections are designed by twins Mariano and Walter De Matteis, the third generation of a family business. 

Not content with a simple video, many of these designers have also organised physical presentations in Milan, where there will be plenty of in-person events, such as the opening cocktail reception, hosted by the Camera della Moda Italiana in the gardens of a sumptuous palace, or that held by Portugal Fashion Week to celebrate its 25th anniversary on Sunday, just before video presentations from David Catalan and Miguel Vieira. Not to mention the presentation from up-and-coming Anglo-Italian streetwear label Jordanluca, organised by the Slam Jam showroom. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 15, 2021","One striking new brand unveiled this weekend in London is Banshee of Savile Row, a bespoke women’s tailoring house that prides itself on using truly top-shelf fabrics with panache. 
The brainchild of Ruby Slevin and Rocco Tullio, an Irish couple who operate between London and rural Ireland and who launched the label in late 2019, the house unveiled a show video entitled The Banshee Wind on Monday evening that smartly captured their tailored take on women’s fashion.
 
To encapsulate the brand’s particular aesthetic, Banshee's fashion clip was shot in the Wicklow Mountains, whose earthy dramatic vistas and heather-embroidered valleys were the perfect setting for the collection.Shot on South African model Emily Meuleman, a drone swoops and dips to highlight the classy oatmeal-cashmere boyfriends’ double-breasted coats; or a very fine checked Chesterfield.  
“The traditional meaning of a banshee is a story of a woman who wails when she predicts death. Calling a woman a 'banshee' can be a negative putdown. We wanted to turn the story on its head, and give the wild woman back her power, to kill off her old self, and embrace the new, the strong, the curious and the freedom that is available to her. We want all women to scream and be heard, and embrace change that is yet to come,” explained Creative Director Slevin.
 
Later, Meuleman walks through a marvellous old Ascendancy maze attired in natty red velvet and burgundy crushed velour pantsuits, worn with a white T-shirt and gold winklepickers; or emotes in a smooth black crepe pantsuit that oozes authority. Captured in clouds of dry ice, Meuleman looks rather marvellous in her bashed gold sequin tops, contrasted by her shamrock-green lipstick. 
 
For country strolls – multi-pleat aqua-blue corduroy trousers, paired with a black waistcoat, pocket watch and a crisp white shirt, whose cathedral high peak collar would have pleased Karl Lagerfeld. The lone model even wore fingerless gloves in the video, directed by Aoise O’hUiginn.
 Slevin and Tullio sat out most of the lockdown, working on pre-production between hilly Wicklow near Dublin and Kerry on the Atlantic coast. Though not on the official calendar, Banshee of Savile Row profited from the attention on London Fashion Week to unspool their debut fashion flick on YouTube.
 
Now back in London, the duo are determined to build their unique take on fashion – a marriage between impeccable bespoke Savile Row tailoring skills and fabrics from Europe’s finest mills.  
 
“We believe that fashion is more than style, class and trend. It has the power to give the wearer strength, confidence and bravery, and this is what the film is all about. It’s about making noise, without really saying a word,” concluded Slevin.
 
The result was a somewhat silent video, unlike any banshee who in Irish mythology heralds the death of a relative by wailing out the sad news.

"Jun 13, 2021","Ferrari, with its prancing stallion symbol, may be the ultimate masculine luxury symbol of Italy. But this weekend, when it launched its first ever full fashion collection on top of its auto production line in Maranello, there were even more girls than guys on its catwalk. 
""Cars don’t have any sex, and neither do these clothes,"" explained Rocco Iannone, the veteran of Giorgio Armani and Dolce & Gabbana, whom Ferrari hired as its creative director of fashion.
 
Ferrari is also the ultimate symbol of commercial success in life, most of whose owners are over 50 before they buy their first high-performance car. Yet this factory runway was crammed full of models half that age, and clothes for Generation Z, albeit inspired by the auto’s ergonomic design, high-performance materials and techy finish.A courageous decision also, considering this brand’s heritage. A visit to the museum of the brand’s founder Enzo Ferrari reveals an exhibition devoted to Gianni Agnelli, the famed former owner of Fiat, whose company eventually absorbed Ferrari, and who was the outstanding example of patrician Italian style.
 
The contrast between Agnelli, with his Neapolitan tailoring, broad silk ties and timeless elegance, could not have been greater. As Iannone sent out a voluminous, logo-driven collection of chunky coats, jackets and sportswear that recalled contemporary ideas by the likes of Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga or Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton. 
 
Instead of Off-White, one wag at the show had already dubbed Ferrari’s debut as ""Off-Red,"" referencing the brand’s legendary Testarossa 12-cylinder roadsters.
 
""For me it was vital to discover who were the icons of Ferrari. To me, Ferrari is a brand that is very much part of pop culture and music and the arts. So, I tried to give sense to the idea of a Ferrari lifestyle. It always existed and that’s what I wanted to make a contemporary collection around,"" explained Iannone in a pre-show press conference.
 
Standing before mood boards that included a montage of stars and icons in Ferraris – from Brigitte Bardot and Lambert Wilson to Linda Evans and Mick Jagger. A newer selection of icons beside them showed off Ferrari’s future targets – Timothée Chalamet, Dua Lipa and A$AP Rocky. 
""Women were always part of our images and reputation. That’s why 80% of this wardrobe is gender fluid and any look can vary in size from XXXS to XXXL,"" noted the designer.
 
Based in Maranello, in a north-central Italian region historically more known for ceramics than cars, Ferrari appears fully committed to a modern-day fashion launch. The collection began e-tailing immediately after the show on both Ferrari’s own website and on that of LuisaViaRoma, the famed Florentine store that boasts Italy’s hippest online boutique.
 
Overnight the collection will also go into Ferrari’s radically upgraded new store in Maranello, again overhauled into a new streamlined space.
 
Ferrari fashion is thus decidedly gender neutral, with curvy shapes, and raglan shoulders that riffed on the cars curvilinear silhouettes. Just as Ferrari’s car designers often based their creations on anatomical details of the human body, so too did Iannone, with elongated waists and musculature.

""Our clothes must be recognizable not for the logo but also for their spirit,"" added the 37-year-old designer.
 
Throughout, he injected loads of high-graphic prints – punchy blends of 1950s posters and magazine covers suggesting speed, images of the Cavallino prancing horse and even champions taking the checkered flag.
 
There was also a sense of high performance about the knitwear, while the key fabric was a feather-light but densely woven nylon that felt like silk to touch.
 
Responding to consumer’s growing demand for customized luxury, Ferrari developed Tailor Made a decade ago, a bespoke service where its well-heeled clients can order the exact color of Connolly leather, cashmere seat cover, or brushed metal gear box to suit their dreams. 
Visiting editors were given a tour of that space that weekend, which clearly inspired Iannone. Beside the multiplicity of materials hung toiles and patterns that played with geometry and an assemblage of fabrics.
 
Whether made in techy jacquards that looked like silk taffeta, treated wools, nylon organza or light carbon fibers, the clothes were mostly rain resistant and durable. 
 
Ferrari will also develop completely new auto frames for uber-wealthy clients, sculpting life-size models out of clay using lasers and computer-guided drills. Those same terracotta cars, very much part of the brand's heritage, appeared in several fine leather trench coats finished with padded red shoulders. Pattern cutters also went into overdrive with drop-shoulder dusters, padded jerkins, and matelassé nylon coats in the brand’s signature canary yellow and dense scarlet.
 
The collection certainly marked a major shift in direction for Ferrari, which will see product diversification shift from a licensing-driven model to a luxury marque concept.
 
Ferrari still plans to retail some licensed products – including Puma sneakers, Ray Ban shades and Lego kits, not perhaps, a luxury item – but its target consumer for clothes is now the happening hipster in LA, Miami, Milan or Dubai. That’s where the brand will open new stores over the next couple of years.
 
There were even some sleek new white Puma sneakers, where Iannone’s influence was evident, their sides cut like car ventilators. Quite why he showed so many high black socks – an odd Italian obsession – with white Ferrari logos was hard to fathom.  
However, all told, this was an impressive auto fashion debut by Iannone, aided by the presence of several super models marching on an LED catwalk. Mariacarla Boscono opened the action, while Natalia Vodianova came in the slipstream for the final look, strutting before a front row that included Ferrari’s two Formula One drivers – Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz – as well as famed industrial designers Marc Newson and Jony Ive.

The entire cast marched in techy high heels that looked to be made of tungsten steel, past the Ferrari assembly line, devoted to its 12-cylinder cars –the heart of the brand's DNA. All inside a plant that barely makes 10,000 cars a year.
 
""This is the haute couture of car manufacturing; every single station is manned. We assemble nothing here with robots. The artisan is at the heart of everything Ferrari does,"" concluded Iannone, who took an extended running bow, before pausing and bowing before John Elkann, the grandson of Gianni Agnelli and the patron of the whole shebang.
 
Will consumers forsake mega runway brands for a car company’s clobber? That’s a big bet, but at least Ferrari, Iannone and Elkann have the couture of their convictions.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 13, 2021","An almost entirely digital London Fashion Week opened Saturday with humanitarian and eco-responsible visions, best exemplified by Bethany Williams, the socially engaged designer who has long used recycled garments part created by prison inmates in her collections. 
This season, Williams unveiled All Our Stories, a collection and show video that stemmed from her work with the East London grassroots organization, The Magpie Project, a charity supporting women and children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 
 
Stemming from the works of artist Melissa Kitty Jarram and referencing folklore passed from generation to generation and tales for children, the 102-second video captured the magical narrative power of childhood stories. Like Williams, Jarram also recycles creatively, using waste book covers in her illustrations to tell new stories.Multiple generations appeared in the video, in bright amalgam sweaters, tops and dresses; or handprinted mini jackets – mums embracing tiny tots; teenagers posed in local parks; a loving couple roller-skating and even a dog in a woolen mini cappotto.

""What we noticed through the story-telling workshops was that the moral of each story always came to kindness, care and respect for one another and how these traits, whilst still important in childhood, have just as much meaning in adult life,"" commented Williams, who was inspired by visits to the V&A Museum of Childhood's garments archives.
 
One was a million miles away from archives in a morning display by Auroboros, a hyper-tech fashion marque whose motto is ""create your own fashion fantasy."" 
Auroboros modestly called their Biomimicry Digital ready-to-wear collection video, ""history in the making"" and an ""activation [that] redefines fashion.""

To be fair to the brand, however, it was pretty remarkable how one could immerse one’s self in this innovative Augmented Reality clothing, the brand helping to whip up interest offline via billboards and fly posters across London. 
 
The results were bio-mechanical-looking creations, blends of nature and technology, sci-fi party fantasy gear that, at its best, recalled Iris van Herpen. Not a bad couturier with whom to be compared. 
 
A purely digital collection seen on a physical model and styled by Sita Abellan, this London fashion week first can be purchased as collection at Dress X and on the Auroboros website. 
 
The most striking video of the opening day of the LFW’s three-day season, though, was a full-length Generation Rewear documentary. A series of portraits of young designers determinedly trying to create responsible fashion by upcycling and recycling dead stock and dumped clothes. At times it was hard to know who everyone was, but their stories of the sharing economy, up-washing, multi-functional clothes and slowing down fast fashion were revealing and inspiring.
 It was left to Qasimi to provide Saturday’s most poetic moment; a sherbet and dusty desert-hued collection that referenced the colors and the shapes of the Gulf Region.
 
Floating tunics, elongated shirting with Nehru collars, block check suits, and a brilliant women’s trouser-suit cut with dhoti pants made for a charming moment as the hyper inclusive cast marched about an all-white modernist villa. Which turned out to be by architect Sir Raymond McGrath, and was nestled amongst a landscaped idyll, designed by Christopher Tunnard. 
 
Very tragically, Qasimi’s founder Khalid Al Qasimi passed away in 2019, but his admirable ideas were very alive in this collection. Polished Emirati sportswear with craft and class.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 10, 2021","With the UK off limits due to many nations due to the pandemic, the weekend’s edition of London Fashion Week is taking place under pretty tricky conditions, however the British Fashion Council still has managed to cram in plenty of action in the three-day season. 
Though largely a digital season the upcoming London Fashion Week, scheduled for Saturday, June 12 to Monday 14, will feature four actual physical events; collections from multiple influential houses – like Preen by Thornton Bregzzi, Bethany Williams, Ahluwalia and Per Gotesson - and several cool collaborations.
 
While the weekend will also witness a whopping 18 collections under the umbrella of the DiscoveryLAB series, all of which are unveiled in morning slots.“This season will continue to celebrate excellence in design and creativity by bringing together 32 womenswear, menswear & accessories brands into one schedule. Most of the content will once again be digital and available to stream on londonfashionweek.co.uk, with designers looking to new, innovative, ways to showcase their collections,” Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, told FashionNetwork.com.
 
Rush picked out collections from BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund winner Bethany Williams, and a digital activation from Qasimi on Saturday as two highlights. Along with  Newgen recipient Ahluwalia, who will debut a film directed by Akinola Davis Jr featuring a new collection and the new Ahluwalia x Mulberry collaboration of bags. Another Newgen designer Robyn Lynch will be premiering a short film directed by Spencer Young, showcasing a non-seasonal menswear upcycled collection with the support of deadstock from Colombia.

Two names to watch in the DiscoveryLAB series, made in collaboration with Toni&Guy, are Auroboros and Chloe Baines. Auroboros, which has collaborated with the Institute of Digital Fashion to create an AR filter of one of their dresses that people can try on virtually, while Chloe Baines will unveil a gender-fluid collection made entirely of upcycled and deadstock materials. 
Due to travel restrictions still and rules on large-scale events, there are only four physical on-schedule evening events. On Saturday, a catwalk show and party with Reuben Selby and Maisie Williams followed by an installation by London-based brand DSK. Monday night will see the collective student event, The London Seven Collective, followed by Cut from the Same Cloth - a collab with Daniel A Hanson.
 
Brexit’s shadow continues to hang over the whole future of LFW. However, the BFC has smartly reacted with a new partnership with Clearpay, a global trade platform promoting British fashion internationally.
 
“While the UK moves through this next year, we continue to work closely with government on the issues that matter to the industry such as talent, trade and intellectual property and ensure the voices of businesses are heard. There have definitely been challenges since January 2021, but there have also been successes. This spring, the BFC secured a change to the Immigration Rules, introducing a ‘stop-the-clock’ mechanism on the T5 (Temporary Worker) Creative and Sporting visa used by models and freelancers in the creative industries,” underlined Rush.
 
The decision allows creative workers to travel in and out of the UK without that time counting towards the 14-day engagement rule, stressed Rush, “meaning international talent now has the right to come to the UK for London Fashion Week and then travel outside for work without their right to work being cancelled. This change is hugely important to supporting the competitiveness of the UK and making our country more accessible to international models and creative talent.”
 
With media reports of international, and multiple European visitors from the continent, being held for five or six hours at Heathrow and Gatwick, and even finger-printed by aggressive immigration officials, the BFC’s lobbying will not go unnoticed.

"Jun 10, 2021","Matty Bovan has won both the 2021 International Woolmark Prizes, in a special virtual event this year, the merino wool industry support group announced Thursday. 
A rare double winner in the closely watched annual competition, Bovan was chosen by a jury that included Carine Roitfeld, Ib Kamara, Shaway Yeh, Sinéad Burke, Tasha Liu, Thom Browne and Julie Davies.
 
New York-raised, but London-trained at Central Saint Martins, Bovan is known for this kicky, lustrous, high-color concoctions.“What impressed me about Matty is his capacity to win both awards – for his innovation and creativity – and I really think he deserves it. He is pure fashion, he makes me dream and he reminds me of a young Vivienne Westwood or a John Galliano and we desperately need that sort of designer in the fashion world of today,” said Roitfeld.
 
Added designer Browne: “Matty is truly and authentically creative, proving and representing that everything starts from pure creativity.”
 
The Woolmark Prize has long been a coveted award, especially since 1954 when a youthful Yves Saint Laurent won the award for a dress, and Karl Lagerfeld that for a coat. This year, Bovan won both the International Woolmark Prize and the Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation. 
Bovan’s latest Ode to the Sea collection drew inspiration from travelling and escapism – going through a traumatic event and coming out the other side. Using roll-end cloth from AW Hainsworth; screen printing and hand painting, Bovan gave new life to discarded pieces of fabric. Limited runs in-house turned deadstock fabric into commercial pieces.
 
“It’s a huge honor to win these prizes and I’m so excited for where it’s going to take me – I was already so thrilled with the Woolmark Prize platform and experience,” said Bovan.
 
“Being a part of the International Woolmark Prize has really helped elevate my brand and elevate my awareness and knowledge of how I operate as a business and as a label. It’s been amazing and I have loved every minute of it,” added Bovan.
 
The other five finalists were Casablanca, Thebe Magugu, Kenneth Ize, Lecavalier and Bethany Williams.
 
In a busy week for Woolmark, the wool industry support group and global trademark, also opened a new space in La Caserne, an exciting new fashion incubator in north Paris, which is also supported by Kering and LVMH.
 
In the Caserne, a Woolmark sourcing showroom will support young designers, students and committed brands with a selection of innovative and sustainable wool fabrics - helping brands discover the versatility of this natural, renewable and circular material.  This sort of commitment has been at the heart of Woolmark’s strategy for many years. The group has worked with LVMH's IME vocational program for the past three years and launched case studies with business school ESCP on the challenges of sustainable fashion. 
 
The incubator’s opening was celebrated with a courtyard installation featuring designs by two of this year’s finalists – Casablanca and Thebe Magugu.
 
So, we also caught up with Damien Pommeret, regional managing director of Western Europe Woolmark, for the latest on all his organization's moves. 
FashionNetwork.com: Why has Woolmark joined La Caserne?
Damien Pommeret: I’m in charge of all Western Europe, and am based in Paris, though a big part of the team is based in London. But when I heard about this new concept, and this location, I thought 'yes.' When people are travelling to see fashion they want to go somewhere easy to get in, where you can have restaurants, terrasses, showrooms, like La Caserne. So, we took a permanent showroom here, right above the entrance. On top of us we have LVMH and on the last floor is Kering. There are a lot of different new designers and brands. The concept is really about bringing people together, people that don’t know each other, there is a great mix.
 
FNW: How do you see this project evolving?
DP: In fashion, there has rarely been a culture to share or exchange. So, we discussed how we will change the way we work. For us, as a non-profit company that has existed for a long time, we do a lot of things, but maybe are not good at communicating that. And here we improve that. We are doing a lot of “on farm” projects - working with animal welfare; on circularities; with all the supplies chain and with brands. We say, ‘Hey do you want to change a little bit your offer?’ because maybe right now 15% of what you sell in upper luxury is still plastic. Many brands don’t know how to do that. So, for example we did a beautiful collaboration with Prada on The America’s Cup, 100% wool collection and no chemicals – that innovation is available for brands and designers.
 
FNW:  How will your space here operate?
DP: We will have two permanent persons. Five days a week you will be able to come here, to see what’s available, to be inspired, to discuss uncertain technical issues. We are also doing partnerships with IFM (Paris' leading fashion school), Parsons and even engineering colleges. In September, we are finalizing a big collaboration with ESCP,  which is one of the best business schools in France. That shows our mission to educate all students, for them to know what a natural fiber is.

"Jun 8, 2021","In mythology, the beautiful anemone flowers has a rather murderous reputation, but in fashion, at least in the hands of Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen it can lead to magic. 
The ancient Greeks believed that the beautiful anemone first flowered from the tears of Aphrodite, mingled with the blood of a wild boar that had gored her lover Adonis. Chez McQueen, images of the bright lobbed and parted flowers were the inspiration for a glamorously gutsy new collection of clothes for the coming fall and winter.
 
Burton’s iconoclastic idea was to take images of the flowers, photocopy them; before then trashing them and photocopying the results again. Before next engineering the images into the dramatic dresses. All 16 looks captured in a great lookbook series shot by master photographer Paolo Roversi in a Paris studio, which seemed to play on the Victorian view of anemones, as expressions of forsaken love.Like in her pre-fall collection, Burton’s fabric of choice is 100% recycled and sustainable polyfaille, ideal for sculpting petal-like shapes into her full skirt dresses; princess waists and grown-up sexy gowns.
 “It feels like now is a time for healing, for breathing new life, for exploring echoes from the past to enrich our future. More than ever, a sense of humanity, of the team working together with a single aim – to make something beautiful, something meaningful – feels both precious and important. We looked at water, for its healing properties, and at anemones. Anemones are the most ephemeral flowers, here made permanent in cloth,” explained Burton, the house’s long-standing creative director.
 
Throughout, the scrunched up floral prints managed to be fragile yet powerful, arresting images printed on black polyfaille dresses, sometimes combined with black leather perfectos with a couture like wide-lapel necklines.
 
The designer also shaped polyfaille into flared frocks; where multiple vertical zips mimic the shape of flowers blossoming. A collection displayed in a private zoom on Tuesday with FashionNetwork.com from the house’s Bond Street store in London, where a sumptuous anemone frock was already on display in the boutique’s window. Though the collection won’t officially start retailing until August.
 
A selection that included structured tailoring, where slim jackets are nipped in at the back with corset-style ribbons and worn over cigarette pants. One polyfaille flouncing gown in a perfect coral pink was remarkable for its color given that the material was recycled. 
Cocoon-shaped flight jackets and bombers, for “everyday couture” worn with bubble skirts with pockets, or aqua-blue sustainable polyfaille cocktails. One great full skirt with giant petal pattern, was laid out on the floor like a massive five-foot diameter flower.  All mixed up with jean jackets in dense felt and denim, and cut in couture-like jackets with corset details and military buttons.
 
For evening, Burton created a series of haunting white T-shirt dresses and cocktails embroidered with metallic silver anemones and lily pads. All anchored by hefty, double-sole pony boots and accessorized with a new Bundle bag with chains, some finished with the metallic silver florals.
 
Summing up her dream, Burton added: “The women wearing the anemone dresses almost become like flowers, like their embodiment, their character – but amplified, grounded, radiant and strong.”

"Jun 8, 2021","The Council of Fashion Designers (CFDA) of America and Fashion Trust USA have announced that they have chosen five promising Black and Brown designers to receive awards of $40,000 each to support the development of their businesses.
 The selected designers include mechanical engineer-turned-knitwear specialist Aisling Camps, New York’s Charles Harbison, Los Angeles-based womenswear designer Sergio Hudson, sustainability-focused Sami Miro, and Omar Salam, founder and creative director of the Sukeina brand.
 
“The Council of Fashion Designers of America is pleased to work with Fashion Trust US to recognize the noteworthy talent of these designers, and provide financial awards to support their vision and short-term goals,” said the CFDA’s executive vice president, Lisa Smilor, in a release.The CFDA Fashion Trust was launched by the CFDA in partnership with fashion writer and philanthropist Tania Fares in 2018. The Fashion Trust is no longer administered by the CFDA, but the U.S. fashion authority said that it was “pleased to distribute the remaining funds of the program to these five talents.”
 The recipients of the $40,000 awards were chosen by a committee of industry experts, including CFDA Black Advisory Board members Tracy Reese, Samira Nasr, Bozoma Saint John, Stacie B. Henderson, and Martin Cooper. The committee also featured Fashion Trust USA co-founders Tania Fares, Laura Brown, Elisa Sednaoui Dellal, Anne Crawford, and Karla Welch.

"Jun 7, 2021","The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the organization that controls the calendar of Paris runway seasons, has unveiled two new digital devices designed to allow fashion houses participating in the next women’s runway season in September to measure their ecological impact. 
The Paris-based federation hired the international consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to develop the two tools, which were in part financed by DEFI, the French semi-state support group for fashion. Both will be fully operational for Paris Fashion Week this fall, which runs from Monday, Sep. 27 to Tuesday, Oct. 5.
 
A first element also offers each participating house the ability to  calculate upstream of the organization of its event - whether runway show, life presentation or showroom - the best choice of service providers to reduce its environmental impact and optimize the social impact.PwC combined the expertise of its sustainable development teams; data analytics teams and the PwC Experience Center, working closely with the Federation. The goal: to calculate 120 KPI of quantitative and qualitative data of the houses.
 
In Paris, the Federation’s steering committee included show producer Bureau Bétak, DLX press agency and the Palais de Tokyo, where the organization stages Sphere, its incubator for fledgling talent.  The federation’s main board is made up of senior executives from the key fashion powers in France – such as LVMH, Kering, Chanel and Hermès.  
“All of the ecosystem's stakeholders have been involved in its development: Houses of all sizes, production agencies, press and communication agencies, modeling agencies, the main places where PFW events take place, institutions. It was developed in 2020, tested in early 2021 and will be fully operational in September 2021,” the federation, which is managed by its executive vice president Pascal Morand, said in a release.
 
Morand unveiled the project on Friday, June 4, the eve of World Environment Day, making Paris the first fashion capital to offer this sort of service for fashion houses. All told, around 80 houses will stage catwalk shows, presentations, phygital events or fashion videos during the city’s fashion season this autumn.

Fashion weeks worldwide have become increasingly conscious of their environmental impact as thousands of participants – models; photographers; hair and make-up artists; magazine editors; influencers and buyers – fly into each of the four great international capitals – London, Milan, New York and Paris – and travel incessantly between events in 12-hour working days.

Another new departure is a tool to enable houses to support the eco-design of their collections by measuring the environmental and social impact on their entire industrial value chain. 
Designed in conjunction with the Institut Français de la Mode, the city’s key fashion school, it was tested with several volunteer brands before its deployment. Once again, PwC combined the expertise of the sustainable development teams, the data analytics teams and the PwC Experience Center. Its technical committee is made up of DEFI; the Fédération Française du Prêt-à-Porter Féminin; the Federation of Knitwear, Lingerie & Swimwear; Alliance du Commerce; Première Vision; ReFashion; Création & Image; IFTH; CETI and COFREET. It has been in development since early 2021, is being tested this June and will be fully operational in September.
 
Additionally, since 2019 the federation has been actively committed to making Paris Fashion Week and the city’s Haute Couture season carbon-zero in transport terms. Since January 2020, the federation has used a fleet of zero-emission DS Automobiles as the official transport of its runway season, while its fleet of Paris Fashion Week shuttle buses and scooters are fully electric.
 
To reduce travel within the city, the federation helped set up a shared space within the Palais de Tokyo that hosts over a dozen events at each fashion week. That will continue in September 2021. Waste at the Paris Fashion Week Center at the Palais de Tokyo is 100% recycled and recovered.

"Jun 3, 2021","The International Woolmark Prize, which is one of fashion’s most prestigious awards, has ramped up its publicity drive with the release of a 2021 video campaign created by the Saint Heron agency. That’s the multidisciplinary platform, studio and creative agency established by Solange Knowles.Called ‘Passage’, the short film is a “celebration of the six finalists” and presents the final Woolmark Prize collection looks from Bethany Williams, Casablanca, Kenneth Ize, Lecavalier, Matty Bovan and Thebe Magugu. It features an ensemble cast of “rising musical talent and legendary figures”.

These include veteran chart-topper Dionne Warwick; actress, model and author, Dominique Jackson; eclectic artist, SahBabii; Atlanta psychedelic soul legend, Joi; and singer, multi-instrumentalist and producer, KeiyaA. So what about the film? Created by Knowles and directed by award-winning director Wu Tsang, it “draws from the masterful styling of Ib Kamara and an original score by Standing on The Corner”.

Knowles said of the link-up: “In continuing Saint Heron’s world making practice, ‘Passage’ further explores my interest in theatrical production through the translation of identity, spirit, philosophy and creation. Whether it be through album artwork, stage design, or filmmaking, I've always sought to create new visual languages that encompass the expressions my other works cannot communicate. 

“I’ve been a longtime fan of Wu Tsang’s work and to be able to work alongside her, the Saint Heron team, and all of the incredible artists and designers in the film, really fortifies the ethos of collaboration and communal creative exchange that we wish to continue to embody.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 3, 2021","ANDAM Fashion Award has chosen 14 finalists for its 2021 edition, including Casablanca, GmbH and Wales Bonner. 
ANDAM, the most important independent fashion award on the continent, has chosen 14 finalists for its 2021 edition.
 
In an impressively packed field, London-based Grace Wales Bonner, the winner of the 2016 LVMH Prize for Young Designers, stands out as one of the favorites for the 300,000-euro award.However, she will receive strong competition from design duo of GmbH, Serhat Işık and Benjamin A.

All told there are seven finalists for the top prize, including Casablanca, the happening Anglo-French label led by DJ designer Charaf Tajer; Area, by the New York duo of Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk; and Rok Hwang of London label Rokh. The seven are completed by Bianca Saunders, a finalist in this year’s LVMH Prize; and Paris-based designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin, who opened a must-see boutique in the Marais in the past year. Underlining the intensity of the competition, the jury increased the number of finalists from five to seven this year.  
The seven emerged from over 300 applicants for the award of ANDAM, which stands for National Association of the Development of Fashion Arts.
 
The jury also boosted the finalists from three to four for its second award, the Pierre Bergé Prize worth 100,000 euros. This year they are EgonLab, Ester Manas, Uniforme Paris and Charles de Vilmorin, the Yves Saint-Laurent lookalike who has been named creative director of Rochas.

"May 31, 2021","Mexico has blasted major clothing brands Zara, Anthropologie and Patowl for using patterns and other elements of Mexican indigenous textiles in their collections without permission, the ministry of culture said Friday.The ministry has sent letters to the three labels asking them to publicly clarify on what grounds ""the collective property"" of indigenous peoples of the southern state of Oaxaca had been privatized, and to indicate how they intended to compensate the communities affected.

Minister Alejandra Frausto told the brands not to undermine the cultures' ""identity and economy"", and called for changes that put indigenous designers from Mexico's 56 ethnic groups on an equal footing with major labels.The protection of their rights, ""which have historically been invisible"", was an ethical principle that had to be addressed at a local and global level, she added.

Separate missives to each brand, dated May 13 and signed by Frausto, pinpoint specific products at fault.

In the case of Spanish firm Zara, the ministry said a Midi dress with a belt incorporated elements from Mixtec culture, from the municipality of Oaxaca in San Juan.

US brand Anthropologie's Marka embroidered shorts are said to contain elements of the culture of the Mixe people, and Patowl, also American, is accused of making a ""faithful copy"" of the traditional garments of the Zapotec people for its Tops printed T-shirt range.

It is not the first time Mexico has taken a stand against the issue.

In November, it challenged French fashion designer Isabel Marant over her latest collection which it said commercially exploited indigenous motifs.

Designer Carolina Herrera, and Spanish companies Rapsodia and Mango have also been singled out for appropriating designs from Mexico.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"May 28, 2021","Next month’s Paris menswear season, whose provisional calendar was released on Friday, will feature 39 shows in a 72-brand season. 
Paris’ menswear week will also boast five fresh designer names on its official calendar, most notably Courrèges, the retro-futurist French house currently enjoying a revival under new creative director Nicolas Di Felice.
 
Scheduled to last six days from Tuesday, June 22 until Sunday June 27, the season will open with Wales Bonner, the young London talent generally regarded as the most important new UK tailor this past decade.Four other fledgling brands have won coveted places on the calendar to stage presentations: Georges Wendell Paris, from France; Gravalot, from Britain; Jan Jan Van Essche from Belgium and Mr. Saturday of Canada.However the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, which controls all runway seasons in Paris, stressed that the exact format of many shows was still to be decided.
 
“Formats will be specified when the final calendar is published,” the Federation noted. Whether these are ultimately live videos, phygital events, closed catwalks or combinations of all three will probably only be decided in the next few weeks by individual houses.
 
On May 19, France reopened café terraces, boutiques and department stores, as the country carefully emerged from its second major lockdown. However, France also recently introduced restrictions on travellers from the UK due to the growth of the Indian Covid variant, meaning many buyers and editors from London are unlikely to make it to Paris. 
Moreover, the season will be denuded of a half-dozen major players: Givenchy, Comme des Garçons, Junya Watanabe, Saint Laurent, Ami and Balenciaga. Though Demna Gvasalia, the designer of Balenciaga, is planning a return to couture for the house during the French haute couture season which is scheduled for July 5 to 8.
 
However, the menswear season in the French capital does still boast some massive global brands and exciting designers such as Louis Vuitton, Dior Men, Hermès, Loewe, Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, JW Anderson, Dries Van Noten and Vetements.
 
Paris has also succeeded in preventing the haemorrhaging of its menswear season compared to London or Milan, which both take place earlier in June. As reported, there are only expected to be four actual live runway shows in Milan during the Italian menswear season in June.

"May 27, 2021","The pandemic and its attendant health protection measures have brought in-person events to a standstill for over a year, forcing luxury labels to entirely rethink the way they communicate, and how they present their collections. Tapping the increasingly widespread use of digital tools, labels have resorted to video shows with various degrees of success. FashionNetwork.com has analysed the phenomenon with Division, an international production company specialised in music and advertising videos, which notably produced the recent films by Saint Laurent, Lanvin, Balmain, Isabel Marant, Etudes and Y/Project.“In less than a year, labels have switched from a photography to a filming culture, driven to produce more and more content for the web, the new showcase for luxury and fashion. Digital tech has been a real game-changer, the engine behind this revolution. The problem is that, until not so long ago, production companies and fashion labels did not mix,” said Arno Moria, co-founder of Division with Jules De Chateleux.

Forced to create videos as a matter of immediate urgency to take part in virtual fashion weeks, some labels turned to photographers and photo agencies, the creative professionals they usually collaborated with. Other labels turned to the event organisers that used to produce their catwalk shows, many of which reinvented themselves as video makers, or to other service providers. Few labels decided to work with fully fledged film directors.One of them was Saint Laurent, one of the first labels to enter the film arena by presenting its men’s collection for the summer 2021 on September 9 2020 - outside of Paris Fashion Week - with a stunning short film by Nathalie Canguilhem, in which acrobatic models took to the Paris rooftops in a breath-taking aerial romp. It was also one of the first videos produced by Division in this new era of virtual collection presentations.

“The first question that arose was how to make a captivating catwalk video, knowing there would be no live audience. There's so much emotion, so much intensity in a show that it cannot simply be translated into the video recording of a live performance. It's like filming a concert without spectators, it doesn’t make sense. Also, a simple recording of a lengthy catwalk show can quickly become unpalatable for the general public. We needed to give the feeling of a live event by using fictional and semi-fictional elements to create tension, inventing a hybrid format [that was] part narrative, part simulated show,” said Moria. An innovative format labelled ‘défilmé’ (unfilmed) by Isabel Marant.

“With Anthony Vaccarello [the creative director of Saint Laurent], we decided to do something that would never have been possible in normal show conditions. We really did bring a crew of models-stuntmen on to the Paris rooftops,” added Moria. “It was the film that kick-started the trend for digital shows. There’s genuine production know-how behind it and, above all, a director who can inspire the audience to fulfil their dreams,” said Gwendoline Victoria, former brand image director at Kenzo, who was hired by Division in September as their head of fashion films and content. 
“For the majority of the labels that approached us, it was the first film of this kind, and they wanted to make a real creative statement with it,” added Victoria. With three films, Saint Laurent has found its signature tone. After Paris, the French label took its aficionados to increasingly distant and spectacular shores, for example with the women’s summer 2021 collection, filmed in the Moroccan desert, and the more recent Fall/Winter 2021-22 collection, whose film was shot in Iceland with a breath-takingly authentic Dantesque scenery as the backdrop. An approach that enabled Saint Laurent to rack up higher and higher YouTube viewing figures for each successive film, from 3.7 million to 5 and then over 10 million.
 
Thanks to digital technology, the label owned by the Kering group was able to stage three fantastical shows, letting the magic of fashion and digital do their work. “It was pure expression, a label’s sheer evocative power,” said Moria. “[Saint Laurent] wanted to stage a show that was out of this world, that would never have been possible in real life. They used every special effect in the book to hoodwink the audience. But to breed desire, you need to be very demanding, and committed to quality. In Iceland, we had to field a production operation that was as extensive as it was substantial, together with paramilitary-style logistics,” he added.
 
Arno went on to say that “[Saint Laurent] experimented with a way of presenting collection images that had never been seen before. It took courage to dare to do so. It was extremely bold. Shooting the video in Iceland in the middle of nowhere involved several days of filming with a truly top-level production team. Not everyone can afford it.”
 
Following in Saint Laurent's footsteps, other labels trod this path, each of them developing their own narrative, using a variety of styles and formats, from documentary to series, from video clip to live performance. “There’s a little bit of everything out there, it's all very hybrid. [Filming] provides endless possibilities to tell a collection’s story, using camera movements, close-up shots to highlight products, even slow-motion sequences,” said Victoria.
 
“Previously, it was only down to pictures, with the great fashion photographers. Then came the crisis and Instagram, with its need for unrelenting novelty. The use of video and digital tech marked a turning point. For me, this is the main new development in the fashion industry. Films have triggered an overhaul in the language of labels, in the way they communicate and present their collections and products,” added Victoria. 
Many labels are busy looking for and testing the ideal formula, like Chanel, which is relying on its own production company and has opted for different solutions in the course of the year, as shown by the label’s latest two events. For the 2022 cruise collection show, staged at the Carrières de Lumières, a quarry-turned-venue at Baux-de-Provence, the label went for a straightforward video recording, while for the previous collection, for the Fall/Winter 2021-22, it adopted a rather more narrative approach, the film recreating the atmosphere of the iconic soirées at Parisian night club Castel.
 
According to Division, producing a film isn’t actually more expensive than staging a catwalk show. On average, the cost of a show by a smaller label is around €50,000, while for bigger houses it can range from €800,000 to €3 million. A short fashion film can instead cost from €60,000 to between €500,000 and €600,000, if not more. “You can be creative irrespective of the budget,” said Victoria, noting that, when all is said and done, “producing a video is less expensive, and a film reaches a much larger audience.”
 
Victoria added that “this is really good for fashion labels. It opens up scores of opportunities and possibilities for the luxury industry. There are many more occasions besides catwalk shows: collection launches, a label's brand message, occasion-specific films, like those for Christmas. You can do everything, from showcasing products to telling stories. It will be difficult to go back to how it was before, to be content with mere video recordings. Not to mention that shooting a film makes it also possible to create plenty of social media content.”
 
It is down to labels therefore to find their own voice and tap the language of films to the full, a language that is infinitely richer and less rigid than that of advertising. “Mediocre, boring internet content is a liability. On the other hand, investing on quality, relevance, creativity and originality, and managing to fashion a script with substance and form, has huge potential. Quality content can contribute to helping labels become publishers, without them having to pay for media space to advertise and start a conversation about their brand,” concluded Moria.

"May 26, 2021","Michael Kors has confirmed plans to return his next collection to a live catwalk on September 10, significantly boosting the calendar of New York Fashion Week this autumn. The event will mark Kors' first appearance on a live runway since February 2020, when the designer presented a collection of uber-comfortable glamour with multiple cashmere capes inside the city’s former Stock Exchange.
 
However, the New York-based fashion house announced Wednesday that the designer will present his Spring/Summer 2022 Michael Kors Collection in the form of a live, in-person runway show on September 10 at 10 a.m.  The official New York season is scheduled to run from Sept. 8-12.Kors’ show will also be brought to life virtually via a multi-layered digital experience debuting simultaneously on MichaelKors-Collection.com. “This is an important moment for New York, and we’re proud to support the city and the industry during this season’s New York Fashion Week. I am thrilled about the return of live performance throughout New York this autumn, and I look forward to presenting my collection to a live audience,” stressed Kors, who is celebrating his house’s 40th anniversary this year.
 
So far, brands such as Tory Burch, Jeremy Scott, Thom Browne, Pyer Moss, Gabriela Hearst, Markarian and Jonathan Simkhai have also confirmed plans to show on the official Council of Fashion Designers of America calendar. Though such a heavy-hitter as Ralph Lauren has still not revealed his plans.

"May 18, 2021","Italy and Germany are celebrating a linkup under the banner of sustainable and responsible fashion. The Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) and its German counterpart, Fashion Council Germany (FCG), are launching the ‘German Italian Fashion Experience 2021’, a long-term bilateral partnership to support emerging brands and designers from both countries. 
 Supported by the ICE Italian Trade Promotion Agency and the Transalpine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Italian Fashion Chamber plans to increase the visibility of its industry in the German market by creating business opportunities in Germany for the transalpine brands participating in the project. 
 
Italian ready-to-wear brands Gentile Catone, Gilberto Calzolari, Apnoea, Melampo, MRZ, Radica Studio, Tiziano Guardini, and DassùYAmoroso and accessories brands Amato Daniele and Michele Chiocciolini are participating in the initiative. From the German side, Antonia Zander, Buki Akomolafe, Julia Leifert, Lara Krude, Natascha von Hirschhausen, Nina Rein, Working Title, Faulhaber Products, Lutz Morris, and Oftt have been selected. The project will take shape through an active virtual showroom which will be open to buyers from June 8 to 11. The goal is to enable the brands to create a network through individual and informal business-to-business exchanges with retail and business experts and top boutiques, according to the project’s dedicated website. 
 
The 10 Italian brands and 10 German brands will present some key looks from their autumn/ winter 2021/2022 collections on the showroom site. Participating designers will also take part in digital workshops and webinars focused on sourcing, distribution, branding, and media in Germany.

"May 17, 2021","The UK may be reopening, but the next London Fashion Week event will be digital-first again. It happens from June 12-14, a week before the final UK reopening date (that reopening assuming, of course, that there are no delays linked to the spread of the Indian Covid variant in the country).The June edition will cover both women’s and menswear and will be primarily digital. But there will also be some physical activations operating strictly in line with official guidelines.

But the digital approach will also continue in September, despite the reintroduction of physical shows for the September 17-21 fashion week.Looking back at next month’s LFW, the event — sponsored by Clearpay — will be celebrating excellence in design and creativity but with a strong skew towards enabling growth with sustainability.

It happens after the Institute of Positive fashion Forum on June 10 and will continue with the pillars focused on at the IPF session — environment, people and community & craftsmanship.

LFW hasn’t yet announced the schedule but the line-up has been unveiled. Taking part will be Ahluwalia, Av Vattev, recent award-winner Bethany Williams, Dilara Findikoglu Ltd, Jordanluca, Liam Hodges, Lyph, Marques ‘ Almeida, Nicholas Daley, Olubiyi Thomas, Per Götesson, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, Pronounce, Qasimi, Robyn Lynch, Staxx, Teija, University of Westminster, and DiscoveryLab in collaboration with Toni & Guy.

"May 14, 2021","Following two seasons with barely any in-person runways due to the Covid-19 pandemic, New York Fashion Week is set to make a spectacular comeback in September, with shows from brands including Rodarte and Altuzarra and the return of the Met Gala. 
Set to run September 8 through 12, the Spring/Summer 2022 season of New York Fashion Week will mark the physical revival of the event, with most runways expected to be held as traditional in-person affairs, rather than the digital shows that dominated the last two seasons.
 
The core of the event’s calendar will be made up of the 11 brands that, with the support of IMG, recently formed the Fashion Alliance: Telfar, Rodarte, Proenza Schouler, Altuzarra, Brandon Maxwell, Prabal Gurung, Sergio Hudson, Monse, Jason Wu, LaQuan Smith, and Markarian.These labels, which have all committed to show their collections at New York Fashion Week for three seasons, starting September, will unveil their latest offerings as part of NYFW: The Shows, a program organized by IMG and sponsored by Afterpay.
 
The Fashion Alliance is just one of the initiatives launched by fashion institutions as a show of industry solidarity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic over the last few months. For example, the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund and the ANDAM prize – both of which have historically focused on emerging designers – have launched grants to support established brands that have struggled to deal with the impact of the health crisis.
 
According to IMG’s president of fashion events and properties, Leslie Russo, the Fashion Alliance will provide support to participating brands in the form of investment, content and talent.
 
“This partnership to me represents the best of what I love about our community, coming together collectively to bring joy to so many people,” Brandon Maxwell told Vogue, speaking of the Alliance. “I look forward to showing my collection in September and, most importantly, celebrating the work of my friends.”
 
Alongside the 11 Alliance members, a number of other American brands will make their New York comeback in September. Kerby Jean-Raymond’s Pyer Moss is returning to the runway for NYFW after a two-year hiatus, while Thom Browne is also coming home following several seasons showing in Paris.
 
And Browne isn’t the only regular of European runways to be heading stateside this season. Oslo-born, London-based Peter Dundas will be showing his collection in New York, where he attended Parsons as a fledgeling designer, as will Moschino. The Italian luxury brand, which usually shows its main womenswear collections in Milan, announced on Thursday that it would be making its first appearance on the official NYFW schedule in September.
 
On the other hand, some New York Fashion Week stalwarts, such as Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors, are yet to confirm their participation. CFDA chairman Tom Ford will, however, feature on the calendar and will also co-chair the Met Gala.
 
Following its cancelation in 2020, the Met Gala will serve as the culmination of NYFW Spring/Summer 2022, taking place on September 13. Celebrating the Costume Institute’s “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” exhibition, the event will be hosted by actor Timothée Chalamet, singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, poet Amanda Gormon, and tennis star Naomi Osaka.
 
“New York Fashion Week is always a celebration of American fashion, but this will take on a whole new meaning in September,” said Ford in a letter to the CFDA earlier this month. “This season’s shows are an opportunity to reaffirm the resilience and independence of American fashion and New York City as a global fashion force.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 14, 2021","IMG announced on Wednesday the launch of the IMG Fashion Alliance, which includes designer launch partners that will form the bedrock of New York Fashion Week’s revitalization, while championing the artistry featured on New York’s global stage. The initiative was brought together in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on the fashion and retail industries worldwide. 

The group is formed of 11 launch partners including Joseph Altuzarra of Altuzarra, Brandon Maxwell, Jason Wu, LaQuan Smith, Alexandra O’Neill of Markarian, Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim of Monse, Prabal Gurung, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler, Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, Sergio Hudson and Telfar.

"May 13, 2021","It is official: the next edition of Frankfurt Fashion Week has fallen through. And the Premium, Seek, Neonyt and Fashiontech shows will not be staging physical editions in Frankfurt this summer. At the end of March, organisers Detlef Braun, Anita Tillmann and their staff were still hoping to be able to stage these events in an in-person format in the German city.However, owing to lack of official approval, abrupt changes in governmental measures, travel restrictions and their attendant quarantine requirements, not to mention many companies putting staff on furlough, the situation is too uncertain to make it possible to hold a physical event in acceptable circumstances, said the organizers of Frankfurt Fashion Week.

“It is impossible to predict exactly what will happen, we are assessing the situation on a monthly basis. We must assume our responsibility as organisers and avoid putting our partners and clients under any kind of risk,” said Anita Tillmann, who is in charge of the Premium show.To meet the needs of the industry, Messe Frankfurt and show organiser Premium are launching FFW Studio, a digital event that will take place on July 5-9. The event is designed as a “platform showcasing selected brands,” and as “a hybrid venue hosting opinion leaders, labels, experiences and entertainment.”

“FFW Studio offers an opportunity to bring the international fashion world together in one place, despite social distancing, and to convey our community’s apparel expertise around the world,” said Olaf Schmidt, vice-president for the textiles and textile technology sector at Messe Frankfurt.

On the agenda: Frankfurt Fashion Week trends, sustainable fashion and digitalisation. After being broadcast live in the course of the event’s five days, all the conferences, masterclasses and presentations will remain available online.

“Over the past year, we have been overwhelmed by shows of solidarity, we received much encouragement from the industry, and gained the certainty that we are not only missed, but necessary. We would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts! We look forward to unveiling new concepts and projects in the coming months, to meet again in person and design the future together,” concluded Tillmann as she heralded the next season of events, at the start of 2022.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 12, 2021","ITS has launched its 19th edition with new prizes and projects. After holding a fully online edition last year due to Covid-19, the International Talent Support competition for young designers, founded by Barbara Franchin in 2002, hopes to return to a physical format. The organisers will decide its format over the coming months depending on the health and safety regulations in place at the time. The event will be held in Trieste in northeastern Italy in October and has just opened applications. The deadline for registration for the contest is set for June 24. 
Participants will compete for various prizes including the three main awards: the OTB Award of €20,000 ($24,243); the ITS Responsible Creativity Award powered by Allianz of €10,000; and new prize, the ITS Digital Fashion Award of €5,000. In addition, Lotto will reward three different designers for work around a new sneaker development project and the ITS Fondazione Ferragamo Award will be dedicated specifically to footwear for the first time. 
 
This year, the contest has chosen “Building the Ark” as its theme, in reference to the “creative ark” highlighted over these 20 years of activity. The theme also refers to the upcoming inauguration of the ‘ITS Arcademy’ in the coming months. The “academy of creativity” will be open to the public, devoted to training, and will feature meetings and exhibitions, bringing together all of the members of the ITS family, including ex-finalists, juries, and other personalities.The event is also launching a new initiative for its 2021 edition. It will feature a series of seven films which will be directed by three former finalists of the competition and based on three different themes, each one supported by one of the main sponsors of the competition: ‘Family’ (OTB), ‘Heart’ (Swatch), and ‘Future’ (Allianz). For this project, the three designers will create a ready-to-wear, accessory, or other design, which will be exhibited at the ITS Arcademy and will integrate into the archives of the new institution. The videos will be showcased between May and October.

"May 12, 2021","Copenhagen Fashion Week is to return physically for SS22 in August. The organiser of the runway event, plus the trade fairs Revolver and CIFF, and industry organisations Danish Fashion & Textile and WEAR, said it will take place from August 10-13 with tradeshows, showcases, activations, installations and talks planned for the four days.The official runway show schedule will cover August 10-12 with CIFF taking place in the Bella Center from August 11-13. The Revolver fair will run at the same time as CIFF, but in Forum and Øksnehallen.

The organisers said there will be strict compliance with any rules and recommendations aimed at keeping exhibitors and visitors Covid-safe.But regardless of any restrictions this might mean, it’s an important move back towards some sort of normality for one of Europe’s major fashion weeks.

Copenhagen Fashion Week hasn’t happened in ‘normal’ circumstances since early last year with subsequent events being either hybrid or fully digital.

The news about the return to physical events follows other key trade shows and fashion weeks announcing their comebacks, which could also mean a revival of the street style frenzy that used to accompany major fashion weeks. 

In late April, the organiser of Scoop and Pure announced the London shows would happen as a combined event in September. And only this week, France’s Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode said July’s couture week would see designers being able to stage shows in front of live audiences.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 11, 2021","Tom Ford has issued a bullish open letter about next September’s New York Fashion Week, in which he confirmed that he will stage his own live runway show in the city. 
“New York Fashion Week is always a celebration of American fashion, but this will take on a whole new meaning in September. After two challenging seasons with no in-person gatherings, we anticipate a signiﬁcant return to live shows. This season’s shows are an opportunity to reaffirm the resilience and independence of American fashion and New York City as a global fashion force,” said Ford in a letter issued on behalf of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).
 
Ford has been the chairman of the CFDA, which controls the runway season in New York, since June 2019.Pre-pandemic, New York could boast over 150 runway shows, making it the world’s busiest catwalk week. However, it remains to be seen if the number of designers who will actually stage shows will be more than a score in September. So far, only Gabriela Hearst, Pyer Moss, Markarian and Jonathan Simkhai have said they plan to stage live events, while major players like Ralph Lauren, Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors indicated they had yet to make a decision.
 
“The Met Gala for the Costume Institute exhibition “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” will close New York Fashion Week, further cementing this moment for our industry, and I am excited to be an Honorary Chair of the Beneﬁt,” Ford added. 
This year the Met Gala has been pushed back from its traditional slot in May, in part to support the renaissance of catwalk week in New York. Besides Ford as honorary chair of the next benefit; co-chairs will include Timothée Chalamet, Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka and Amanda Gorman. That event is planned for Sept. 13.
 
“I started my career on Seventh Avenue and while I spent most of my working life in Europe, I am incredibly proud to be an American designer and a part of our community and New York Fashion Week,” said Ford, who was creative director of Gucci in Milan for 15 years and creative director of Yves Saint Laurent in Paris for five years, before being fired from both positions in 2004.
 
Since launching his eponymous label, Ford has staged shows primarily in New York, though he did come in for some criticism for lack of esprit du corps after deciding to stage his February 2010 show in Los Angeles, during the New York season. However, this fall he will be back in NYC.
 
“New York Fashion Week is set from Wednesday, September 8 to Sunday, September 12. The talent lineup will be strong with designers returning to the week and, in some cases, to New York. I look forward to presenting my Spring 2022 collection during the week,” the 59-year-old Texan concluded.

"May 8, 2021","The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode confirmed Friday that it is planning to host live catwalk shows in Paris this summer, during the upcoming menswear season in June. 
“Fashion Houses may organize physical shows and presentations. Depending on the evolution of the sanitary situation, the physical events may welcome guests in accordance with a specific health protocol and conform to measures yet to be determined by the public authorities,” the Federation said in a release on Friday.
 
However, the Federation, which controls access to the official calendar to the Paris runway seasons, indicated that it still had little idea of how many brands will stage actual shows before live audiences. The season’s Provisional Official Calendar will only be published during the week of May 24.However, the Federation stressed that all menswear shows, and the subsequent haute couture season in July, will be available for viewing on the Federation’s website.  The menswear season in Paris features up to 70 brands, led by major players like Hermès, Dior, Paul Smith and Givenchy; and more fashion forward legends like Rick Owens, Comme des Garçons, Yohji Yamamoto and Dries Van Noten. 
“Their broadcast as well as all the digital events registered in the Official Calendar will continue to be showcased on the Paris Fashion Week platform and will benefit from the global amplification network of our partners,” the federation added.
 
For the past several season since the pandemic struck, all French runway seasons have been overwhelmingly online show videos. During the last official runway season – women’s ready-to-wear staged in early March - only two out of some 80 houses had an actual live audience at a catwalk display.
 
“It’s very good news that there will be physical shows. Our industry needs them to return. How many brands will participate is a difficult question. But, at least, there is now light at the end of the tunnel. Plus, I imagine the bigger fashion house have studied two scenarios, live and video. Let’s see how things develop,” Ralph Toledano, president of the federation, told FashionNetwork.com. 
This week, Chanel’s fashion division president Bruno Pavlovsky told the press that the house intends to stage a physical couture show in Paris in July. The French couture season has around 25 official shows including such stellar designer marques as Dior, Schiaparelli, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Giambattista Valli and Fendi.
 
France is gradually emerging slowly from its second lockdown, as new cases of Covid are still running at close to 30,000 daily. However, President Macron has announced a reopening of most stores for May 19, along with terraces but not the interiors of restaurants. Moreover, multiple museums and cultural centers are already expecting to open on May 19, leading many people to expect that in order to respect sanitary regulations many of the French catwalks shows will take place inside museums this summer. 
The next Paris menswear season is scheduled from Tuesday, June 22 to Sunday, June 27, following the Milan menswear season, timed for June 18 to 22. One week after the French menswear season, Paris will stage the four-day haute season timed from July 4 to 8.
 
Accreditation for media, buyers and photographers is already open.

The trade fair, with its attendant catwalk shows, was scheduled to take place next June, but its forthcoming hybrid edition has now been suspended due to the international travel restrictions affecting most of its foreign visitors.Organiser Fira de Barcelona has just confirmed the news. It told radio station Cadena SER that 75% of the event’s participants come from outside Spain. A powerful argument which, after consultations with industry stakeholders, led the organiser to cancel the event for the dates initially planned. Fira de Barcelona is currently exploring alternatives, in order to find a suitable solution and format to stage the event before the end of the year.

Times are tough right now for Barcelona Bridal Week. Last April, after a four-year partnership, Swiss cosmetics company Valmont ended its collaboration with the Barcelona event. In the absence of a main sponsor, the event therefore reverted to its original name: Barcelona Bridal Week.After postponing the dates of the most recent edition, held in hybrid format due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event expected to adopt a format similar to that of its summer 2020 edition, staged in partnership with La Fura des Baus. The Barcelona Bridal Week catwalk shows were scheduled on June 15-19, while the trade event was set to take place on June 18-20.

"Apr 27, 2021","Thom Browne will stage his next fashion show in New York this September, in a show of support for the city and for his partner Andrew Bolton. 
His return comes after a five-year stint during which Browne has presented both his menswear and womenswear collections in Paris, a move that significantly weakened the New York runway season.
 
Bolton is the main fashion curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. The Met is planning an historic fashion double-header of exhibitions over the next year, which will debut with In America: A Lexicon of Fashion in early September.The exhibition will also celebrate the Costume Institute’s 75th anniversary. And it will coincide with the next New York catwalk season, scheduled to run between Sep. 8 and 12, during which Browne will stage his show. Though the house cautioned that Browne then plans to return to Paris after this brief hiatus in New York.
 
The designer’s past two shows have been video displays. The first for his spring 2021 collection was staged inside the LA Coliseum, while the second featured Olympic skiing champion Lindsey Vonn racing past a cast of models and mannequins on the slopes of Solitude Mountain resort in Utah.
 Browne plans to show his men’s and women’s collections together, though he has not confirmed the date of his show, or its location, or whether he will stage a physical catwalk event. Though most likely, it will be a blend of digital and phygital. 
 
One of America’s most acclaimed designers, Browne redefined men’s fashion with invention of the little-boy suit; and his blend of preppy aesthetics with couture concepts, before translating that to a growing women’s and kids’ business.
 
In a smart media coup, he dressed Alan Kim, the child star of the Oscar nominated film Minari in Thom Browne Kids for this week’s Oscars.
 
Though still based in New York, in 2018 Italian menswear giant Zegna acquired an 85% stake in Browne’s business, valuing the fashion house at over $400 million.

"Apr 26, 2021","Mr Porter’s on the search for new global design talent. The high-end online menswear retailer has launched Mr Porter Futures, a “first-of-its-kind global and comprehensive talent search” for three aspiring menswear designers.After a year of mentoring, the three selected designers (or design duos) will have their resulting 15-piece+ ready-to-wear collection made globally available on the Mr Porter site in September 2022.

The chosen trio will be adopted by Mr Porter and a team of industry mentors to participate in a year-long design and business mentorship programme, beginning this September.Built around Mr Porter’s 10th anniversary themes of “craftsmanship, discovery, inclusivity and community”, Futures is “open to anyone across the globe who meets the criteria*, and aims to identify and nurture new design talent from outside the fashion mainstream, breaking down the barriers to luxury fashion by drawing eligible candidates from an international pool, and selected through an initial anonymous application review process”. 

The goal is to discover “original voices, lift new talent and introduce them on a global stage”, Mr Porter added. 

The selected designers will undergo a programme of workshops and one-to-one coaching, “benefiting from access to leading mentors in the fashion industry alongside Mr Porter's in-house team of buyers, designers, and creative and marketing experts"". 

Beyond the mentoring and coaching, “each designer will gain the essential marketing and retail skills required to build successful, standalone brands in an increasingly competitive marketplace, while also designing, developing and delivering their very own responsibly sourced and produced collections"", through the support of Mr Porter's own-label Mr P team and consultancy Create Sustain.

The inaugural Selection Committee will include: Nicholas Daley, menswear designer; Julie Ragolia, brand consultant, stylist and Mr Porter contributor; Tatsuo Hino, director of Beams & Co and Mr Porter Style Council member; Reese Cooper, designer; Judith Tolley of the Centre for Fashion Enterprise, London College of Fashion, UAL; Olie Arnold, Mr Porter style director; and Sam Kershaw, Mr Porter buying director.

Kershaw said the Futures initiative was “born from a desire to discover and develop new talent from the global world we live in, and for the global community Mr Porter serves. 

“We have always been committed to championing a diverse mix of new and emerging designers throughout Mr Porter's decade in business, but if this year has taught us anything, it is that we have the responsibility to use our global platform to give equal opportunities to all new aspiring menswear voices, no matter their experience or background"". 

He added: ""[Our] anonymous application process ensures that the programme is open to everyone, including those outside of the industry mainstream. We are also proud to be shaping the future of menswear to produce high quality, responsibly sourced collections that are designed with inherent value, longevity and integrity, qualities Mr Porter prizes above all else”.
 
Applications open on 26 April and will close 6 June. Applicants must be aged 18 or older and cannot already own a registered or trademarked business with an annual turnover of over €10,000. They must be able to undertake the majority of the programme remotely.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 20, 2021","Michael Kors feted his 40th anniversary with a performance by Rufus Wainwright; a video show shot outside and inside the Shubert Theatre; a vintage-with-a-twist collection and guest appearances by Broadway show legends, all collectively unveiled Tuesday morning in New York. 
“We have all had such a longing for community, travel and experiences so the idea of my beloved Broadway being shut down and all the talented people being out of work breaks my heart…. So, this is a love letter to Broadway; the theatre; live performances and to New York City,” explained Kors in a Zoom with European editors a day before.
 
The two-part event was split between a visit to Sardi’s, Broadway’s most famous restaurant, famed for its caricatures by Russian-American artist Alex Gard, for each of which he was paid one square meal per day. In Kors’ video, the caricatures come alive, and living legends wisecrack, and recall their favorite looks by Michael. Kors' cast includes Bette Midler, Cynthia Nixon, Bernadette Peters, Rosario Dawson, Alan Cummings; Billy Porter, Chita Rivera; Matt Bomer, Marisa Tomei, Ashley Park and Ariana DeBose. 
“Doing good has never looked so good,” says Nixon, thanking an unshaven Kors for a generous contribution to the Actors Fund. Broadway’s contribution to New York cannot be underestimated either – providing almost 100,000 local jobs and bringing $15 billion annually to the local economy.
 
The designer’s thinking process was ignited by finally attending 'About Time,' the Costume Institute’s exhibition tracing a century and a half about fashion, focusing on what clothes stand the test of time.
 
As a result, he focused on his own archives, which he freely admitted are “terrible,” as he gave away too many clothes as gifts to friends. This fall/winter 2021 collection playing on Kors’ iconic styles and motifs – from big-cat graphics to power-shoulder silhouettes to extravagant American sportswear.
 
To celebrate the anniversary, Kors created the MK40 Reissue Capsule, a special curation of looks inspired by the archives. All of them dating back more than 20 years, but reproduced and redesigned for today, with a QR code in the label, so the customer can discover the story of each look, and turn it into an archival piece.
 
“The connective thread is always this juxtaposition between opulence, glamour, simplicity and ease,” said Kors, taking three seconds to pronounce the word 'ease.'
 
Though the quintessential New York designer, fashion billionaire Kors’ hometown is Merrick on Long Island. It’s a small town noted for its overachievers – from Mario Puzo, the author of The Godfather, to Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, to Ed Begley, the hardman of so many Westerns. 
His cast of models then strutted down 44th street, passing Sardi’s - Bella Hadid in a red patent leather caban, veteran model Carolyn Murphy in a tan calf leopard trench. A trio of snazzy suits with short slit skirts in zebra print, dogtooth or cheetah.  While contemporary archive picks included glen plaid wool pantsuits; tailored cheetah-print coats; precision-cut glove leather pantsuits; and puffer coats finished in tartan.
 
Oodles of urban polish, and galloons of glamour at the finale with a series of screen-goddess metallic dresses; a stretch jersey cocktail with hand-painted paillettes and a marabou feather neckline; and a red-carpet explosion with Helena Christensen in a silver, broken-glass-style column, and Naomi Campbell glistening in black sequins. Then again, Sardi’s was where they invented the Tony Awards, so that made abundant sense.“It’s the opposite of this messy, slouchy and quite frankly undone look that we have all gotten very used to. It’s about stepping out, definitely. We are starting to hear people thinking about, ‘what will I be doing for New Year’s Eve? Where will I be for Christmas? I want to get dressed up when I go back to the office. And end my life in slippers and track pants!’ This fall will be about learning to walk in heels again, 'cause everyone is going to want to strut their stuff,” sniffed Kors, whose cast ended up sitting inside the Schubert socially distant in rapt attention before Rufus.
 
Working his way through a medley of Big Apple classics - 'City Lights,' 'New York State of Mind' and 'There’s No Business like Show Business,' Rufus crooned in an open-neck shirt and tuxedo.
 
“Thanks to all of you for 40 years of incredible memoires,” concluded Kors, who took his bow with Wainwright with an enormous smile.

"Apr 19, 2021","With European populations slowly but surely being vaccinated, designers on the Continent are suddenly expressing a new optimism. Few more so than Demna Gvasalia of Balenciaga, who celebrated the presentation of the house winter 2021 pre-collection with a 'Feel Good' video and an Amélie Poulain worthy look-book, unveiled Sunday online. 
Made in collaboration with artists Kamilya Kuspanova and Anton Bialas, the three-minute video was an entirely mood piece featuring no clothes or accessories from Balenciaga. What it did feature were giant seascapes; Arcadian highlands; sunsets reflected in an eyeball; wild horses running and a dozen skydivers linking hands in a joint jump. The sheer beauty of the planet heralded by images of manta rays feeding; petals being gently blown apart; dolphins leaping majestically and little children playing with baby donkeys or farmyard chicken. An unseen narrator intoning slowly, “alive, old, free, together,” along with a wall of synthesizer sound in a film named 'All Will Be Well'.
 
The actual clothes were presented in a look-book photographed by Patrick Welde against blank backgrounds. Before clever post-production placed the cast before legendary international tourist attractions. None of the looks referenced the link-up with sister brand Gucci, revealed in Gucci’s latest show video on Thursday.The opening look was twinset of matching bubblegum pink hoodie and cape, on which was written 'Gay Pride', worn with oversized faded denim pants. The model standing sternly in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
 
Before Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, a young lady stood in oversized black Balenciaga sweatshirt, with the legend 'Established in 1917'. 
 
Traipsing around the planet for iconic locations – Pont des Arts in Paris; Taj Mahal in Agra; Atomium in Brussels; the Hollywood sign in LA and Pantheon in Athens. From Piazza San Marco to Mount Fujimori to the Sydney Opera House, the models realizing a dream of touring the world like the dwarf in Amélie Poulain.
 
“In these images, the collection goes around the world, anticipating a return to possibility of global travel,” explained the Georgian-born designer. 
Before Big Ben, a voluminous leather blouson worn with track pants; in front of the Eiffel Tower, a quirky Asian model looks marvelous in a denim combo of trucker jacket and jeans sewn as the lover half of the rock groupie dress. The gal mock holding the top of the tower, like in an excited tourist photo.
 
Most memorably, a dude in moth-worn jeans worn under a massive pale gray cloak-coat standing before a soaring Aztec temple; or a gal in washed out denim overcoat before the Duomo of Milan.
 
An essentially androgynous collection made overlarge and slouchy, over 90% of whose fabrics were in certifiably sustainable fabrics. All ideal for comfortable travel.
 
Demna cutting with venomous volume pagoda shoulder trenches or blue floral ruffled party frocks. Interweaving double white stripes patches and panels, in an active sport couture moment.
 
This pre-coll' also displayed several cool and commercial new bags. Most notably a natty all-gold, grommeted Neo Classic bag, that incorporated elements from the 20-year-old iconic Balenciaga bag, with extra studs and a heart-shaped hanging mirror.  Along with a bold plaid plastic woven tote Bistro Basket “inspired by the everlasting woven objects in typical French bistros.”
 
All told, a dose of optimism from an ever enthusiastic optimistic designer, and why not?Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 17, 2021","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) has announced the launch of CFDA Connects, a programming network aiming to support regional fashion weeks and organizations across the United States. 
The network seeks to promote American fashion by skill sharing and connecting domestic regional markets with the wider fashion industry, both on a national and an international level. In order to do so, the initiative will leverage CFDA resources covering professional and business development and education, trade events, supply chain and local manufacturing, social impact and sustainability.
 
Members of the network will be given access to Runway360, the website launched by the CFDA as the digital home of American fashion collections in September of last year. This will allow design talent from across the U.S. to be centralized on a single platform, facilitating the discovery of brands and the provision of industry support, while also amplifying the voices of the regions involved.At launch, CFDA Connects participants include 10 regional American fashion organizations: Columbus Fashion Council, Dayton Emerging Fashion Incubator, Hawaii Fashion Week, Indiana Fashion Foundation, Kansas City Fashion Week, Miami Fashion Week, Philadelphia Fashion Week, Ragtrade Atlanta/Atlanta Fashion Week, Saint Louis Fashion Fund, and Texas Fashion Industry Initiative.
 
CFDA executives will meet regularly with representatives from each of these organizations, forming a collective of executives and founders who will engage in roundtables and discussions, as well as training and development activities. It is hoped that this will both encourage a sense of community in the national fashion industry and help amplify and strengthen participating organizations.
 
“Our organization serves the whole American fashion industry—all 50 states—and we are excited that CFDA Connects will collectively bond our industry and affiliates with the diverse and burgeoning small businesses that make up our country’s economy,” said CFDA CEO Steven Kolb in a release. “The symbiotic relationships will generate mutual support opportunities serving to everyone’s benefit, and the larger we grow our network, the stronger the American fashion industry becomes.”
 
The launch of CFDA Connects follows on the heels of the recent establishment of the Re: Generation Innovation Scholar Award, a $30,000 annual scholarship for innovation in sustainability launched by the CFDA in collaboration with the Swarovski Foundation in early April.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Apr 16, 2021","Adidas revealed on Thursday a new eco-friendly Stan Smith shoe made from mushroom-based material innovation that looks and feels like leather. Dubbed the Stan Smith Mylo, named after the innovative material, it is made from renewable mycelium - the underground roots of mushrooms - and is created using a highly efficient grow process that takes less than two weeks.

“The introduction of Mylo as a new material is a major step forward in our bold ambition to help end plastic waste,” said Amy Jones Vaterlaus, global head of future at Adidas. “As a planet, we must learn to work with nature rather than against it and put all our efforts into finding innovative solutions that are created responsibly with resources that renew at a sustainable pace. designed in synergy with earth’s ecosystems. and as a brand, we continue to explore the possibilities in material innovation.” 

The new concept was made possible through a partnership with Bolt Threads, a biotechnology company committed to creating the next generation of advanced materials.

“By creating the iconic Stan Smith with a mylo material upper, adidas is demonstrating the far-reaching potential of this innovative material,” said Jamie Bainbridge, VP of product at Bolt Threads. 

“We are thrilled to be working with adidas in the kind of development partnership that makes innovation a reality. Mylo has the strength and performance it does today thanks to the guidance and deep technical expertise of the adidas team in making great footwear.”

Adidas said it chose its simple and classic Stan Smith as the first silhouette to be crafted from the game-changing material as it is one of its biggest and most iconic franchises, meaning it can scale the rollout of Mylo faster for more environmental impact. 

Adidas has previously dived into innovative materials, as part of a partnership with the Parley for the Oceans initiative. It launched Parley-branded shoes and clothes out of ocean plastic in 2020 and ""Primeblue"" fabric containing Parley marine waste in existing lines like its popular Ultraboost shoes.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 15, 2021","Following a two-year absence, Pyer Moss, the New York-based fashion brand led by Kerby Jean-Raymond has revealed that it will be returning to the runway on the second weekend of September.
 Presented in September 2019, the label’s last show was hosted at Kings Theatre, in Jean-Raymond’s native Flatbush, Brooklyn, and was the third and final installment of “American, Also.”, a series exploring the issue of the erasure of African American narratives in popular culture.

"Apr 14, 2021","MBFW Madrid brought its 73rd edition to a close on Sunday April 11, the second time the fashion week was held in the Spanish capital during the pandemic. The event was staged again in hybrid format, a compromise solution that allowed organising body Ifema to hold catwalk shows with live audiences, albeit with attendance reduced by 30%. The shows were also streamed live on Ifema’s site and social media platforms, inaugurating a renewed season of fairs and shows by the Madrid organisation.As the event organiser had indicated last January, the aim was to “create the safest social and health environment for designers, sponsors and event attendees alike.” As a result, hydro-alcoholic gel was available everywhere at the latest Madrid fashion extravaganza, face masks were used extensively and all participants, down to the last assistant, took rapid antigen tests.

In this somewhat unusual context, MBFW Madrid kicked off on Thursday April 8 with the shows of established labels Andrés Sardá, featuring a lingerie collection by Nuria Sardá, and Maya Hansen, who returned with her signature corsets after being absent for several seasons. Both labels presented their latest collections with a live performance before broadcasting their videos, while Pablo Erroz and Otrura instead staged catwalk shows marking their maiden appearance at the event. Otrura, a contemporary couture label led by Sergio Lazaro and Veronica Abián, won the best collection prize awarded by L'Oréal Paris.Seville-based couture label Fernando Claro showcased flowing garments in which tassels mixed with Andalusian-style dresses, in a nod to the bullfighting tradition. Galician designer Roberto Verino was keen to uphold the notion of “quality rather than quantity,” with a collection that invited a reflection on fashion consumption. Classic tailoring met urban and sportswear style in the day’s last collection, by García Madrid.

The event’s second day was reserved to shows by industry heavyweights like Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada, who told Spanish news agency EFE that “people are completely bewildered, after wearing tracksuits for a year,” and advocated a “global rethinking” of the fashion sector, before presenting an extensive collection consisting of 50 colourful looks.A yearning for a more festive mood was reflected in the party dresses by Hannibal Laguna and in the garments featuring dual-use technological materials by Custo Barcelona. “This situation has been going on for so long. I don't know how much longer people can resist. We are at the end of our tether,” the Catalan designer told EFE, explaining his concern that “buying clothes is an emotional and social affair, and these are precisely two of the areas affected.”

For its part, subversive label Brain&Beast did not miss the opportunity, presenting a “tribute” to its moments of joy. While Maite by Lola Casademunt, a regular at 080 Barcelona Fashion, made its Madrid debut with a collection inspired by London's Chelsea neighbourhood. Andalusian designer Ernesto Naranjo went for an atemporal collection, labelled with the number ‘007’ and presented in digital format, portraying a “combative and rebellious” mood.The last day dedicated to shows by established designers, Saturday April 10, featured Ángel Schlesser, a label whose goal is to “empower women” through clothes inspired by notions of diversity and inclusivity. The same day featured a show whose audience included several Spanish government representatives, something unusual for an Ifema event. Ulises Mérida presented a collection, developed in collaboration with the Apramp association, whose garments were made by 12 women who were victim of human trafficking. Among the guests, Equality Minister Irene Montero, Home Secretary Fernando Grande Marlaska, Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo and the deputy mayor of Madrid, Begoña Villacís. Begoña Gómez, the wife of Spain’s Prime Minister, attended instead the show by artisanal label Guillermo Décimo.

Among the other collections on show, there was Valencia couture label Isabel Sanchís, whose designer commented on the newly emerging fashion show format, saying that “we are missing in-person audiences, but through live streaming we are able to reach a wider public.” And Mesa, the label by Juan Carlos Mesa, also the creative director of Ángel Schlesser, a label specialised in evening and occasion dresses. After issuing a strong call for equal opportunities for women at the Ángel Schlesser show, with celebrities like actress Cayetana Guillén Cuervo, the designer staged a social media rave at his eponymous label’s show.Sunday April 11 was the day reserved to the EGO programme, dedicated to emerging talent. Among the labels presented, Corsicana, Cast Studio, Sergio Villasante, Velásquez, Georgiela Studio, Montenegro and Colombian label Rubearth, whose collection was recognised with the €3,000 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Talent Award.

After four intense days dedicated to Spanish fashion, MBFW Madrid gave way to ‘Madrid es Moda’, a week of events in the Spanish capital designed to energise an industry that accounts for 2.8% of the country’s GDP.

"Apr 12, 2021","Bottega Veneta took its social media distancing position to a new level of aloofness, when it announced that it had staged a secret show in Berlin nightclub Berghain, while pointedly not releasing images of the event. 
The Italian brand, which is owned by the French luxury conglomerate Kering, did, however, unveil a series of photos of notable DJs, artists, fellow designers and even its competition entering the famed Berlin after-hours techno club. Among whom Virgil Abloh and Stefano Pilati were seen walking into a fall-winter collection entitled 'Salon 02 Berlin.'
 
BV’s creative director Daniel Lee had staged 'Salon 01' in a top-secret show in London last autumn. Lee has also withdrawn BV from Instagram and Facebook, even if the house’s ad campaigns and his new audio-visual digital quarterly, called Issue, unveiled two weeks ago, garnered plenty of attention on social media.Most curiously, Abloh is the menswear designer of Louis Vuitton, the largest brand within LVMH, Kering’s bitter rivals. Even taking into account collegiality, it will surely come as a surprise to many that a press release from a key Kering fashion house pointedly features an LVMH designer – especially as he is wearing Vuitton-logo clothes.
 
Despite releasing photos of Bottega Veneta guests, the Venetian marque did not provide any images from inside the club. There are only due to be released in June with a matching video.
 
Berghain does have a legendarily tight door, where uncool citizens are summarily and humiliatingly banished. Located inside a former power-plant with 18-meter-high ceilings, Berghain is often nicknamed the world capital of techno music, as those of us whom have made it inside can attest. A symbol of the German capital’s long love affair with decadence and hedonism, where patrons engage in sex in dark side rooms; all photography is banished inside Berghain, where every clubber is obliged to cover their smart phone with a sticker on entry.
 
Photos taken outside BV’s Salon 02 of guests arriving in daylight also show ballet star Roberto Bolle, music legend Tricky, ace DJ Honey Dijon, Burna Boy, Skepta, Slowthai, Kwes Darko, Oumi Janta, Michelle Nicol, Thea Djordjadze, Marc Goehring, Polina Semionova, Maria and Joerg Koch and Sven Marquardt – the famous head bouncer of the club.
 
Honey Dijon and Skepta were dressed in Bottega Veneta total looks from Salon 01; while Dijon also carried the Point bag, a key design in that collection.

Originally scheduled for the end of March, the Fall/Winter 2021 event features more than 100 runway shows from both Chinese and international brands. The shows are focused at the fashion week’s Xintiandi main venue, where Shanghai’s own Mark Fairwhale opened proceedings on Tuesday evening.
 
The venue also saw supermodel Lv Yan’s Comme Moi and 2019 ANDAM Award finalist Dawei make their Shanghai debuts on Wednesday, while contemporary womenswear brand Mayali –  the winner of last October’s Award for Emerging Talent Presented by Visa – will be hosting its first runway show in Xintiandi on Tuesday, 13 April.Outside of Xintiandi, Labelhood, Shanghai Fashion Week’s incubator for young talent, has taken over the Tank Shanghai exhibition space in the West Bund neighbourhood. Here the Youtopia incubation project is hosting shows from newcomers including Anno Mundi, Fivekoh, Momonary, Sorgenti and Toile.
 
Emerging Chinese designers including Angel Chen, Rui, Yuhan Wang and Private Policy, are also hitting the cultural hub throughout the week, alongside fashion week first-timers like Louis Shengtao Chen, VII Victor x Wang Fabric Porn and Dumpty.
 
In addition, over at the Jing An Kerry Center, the SIFS showcase project is bringing global fashion to Shanghai, with shows from Florentine label Ermanno Scervino, New York’s Jason Wu, and bridal brands Pronovias, Muse Marry and Nicole Milano.
 
And if that wasn’t enough, Dior is debuting its pre-fall collection at the Shanghai Long Museum, in West Bund, on Monday, 12 April.
 
In parallel with the runway action, this season’s Shanghai Fashion Week brings together an “integrated ecosystem” of industry-oriented platforms for the 13h edition of the Mode Shanghai Fashion Tradeshow. This April the tradeshow focuses on “exchanges and mutual promotion between all sides of the industry” as part of a collaborative atmosphere aiming to support the sector’s recovery in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
With this objective in mind, a number of other B2B events have been organized to take place at the same time as the fashion week, including the Fashion in Circulation exhibition and symposium, which seek to strengthen ties between fashion brands and the supply chain.
 
Having hosted the world’s first purely digital fashion week in collaboration with Alibaba Tmall in March of last year, Shanghai returned to physical shows in October. This season, alongside its packed calendar of physical events, Shanghai Fashion Week has also doubled down on its digital initiatives. Notably, it has launched Shanghai Fashion & Lifestyle Carnival, an online platform allowing brands to sell pieces from their latest collections directly to consumers.
 
Top Chinese live streamers Austin Li and Viya have also lent their expertise – and impressive follower counts – to the fashion week, with Li hosting a Labelhood livestream show on Tuesday, 6 April, and Viya participating in a See Now Buy Now event with designer platform ITIB.
 
Finally, Shanghai Fashion Week has announced that Xiao Xue, former publisher and editor-in-chief of Elle China, has been appointed for a three-year term as the event’s ambassador, a role in which she is expected to use her position as a “Chinese fashion and lifestyle opinion leader […] to witness the innovation and change from the new season.”
 
“Today’s Shanghai Fashion Week is far more than just a show, but also the best platform for China’s fashion industry”, said Xue in a release. “I believe that this platform will play a greater role in leading industrial development, supporting Chinese brands, and promoting sustainability and women power. It is also the best stage for international brands to showcase in China,” she concluded.

"Apr 9, 2021","Not many countries manufacture as much fashion as Turkey, even if few of its designers are internationally known. That may be about to change, since local fashion leaders are in the process of creating a Turkish Fashion Council to nurture local talent and accelerate the growth of transcontinental brands. Like every nation, Turkey has grappled with Covid-19; the country ranks seventh worldwide for coronavirus cases with 3.7 million. Nonetheless, this week, Istanbul Fashion Week will take place with some 30 shows, albeit all of them online, even as the country goes back into a strict new lockdown starting on Tuesday, just as the four-day season opens.
 
To gauge the atmosphere in the Turkish fashion scene, we Zoomed with Seda Domaniç, who was the editor-in-chief of Turkish Vogue for over a decade, and now manages a consultancy in Istanbul, advising the season on key goals like global brand strategy and digitalization.The actual season is organized by the Istanbul Ready-to-Wear and Apparel Exporters Association (IHKIB); under the leadership of Republic of Turkey Ministry of Trade. It is supported by Turkey Promotion Group (TTG), the Fashion Designers' Association of Turkey (MTD) and Istanbul Fashion Academy (IMA).FashionNetwork.com: What sets Istanbul Fashion Week apart from other weeks in Europe, or elsewhere?
Seda Domaniç: Turkey is the sixth largest supplier of clothing in the world. It’s a really huge manufacturing hub, and there is a lot of skilled traditional craftmanship here; along with rich layers of our historic culture. So our goal is to bring all three together. Plus we have a giant textile industry, yet our designers are relatively small. We want to change that.
 
This is our second season where everything will be digital. Plus, this season is seasonless. In our view, seasons have lost their meaning – as designers have the flexibility to produce what they want anytime. And this is a gender-neutral event – for men and women.  We have staged it twice a year for the past 12 years; and hopefully next October it will have live shows again, though of course with a digital mix. Traditionally, we stage the season in central hubs, or historical locations, like the Zorlu Performing Arts Centre, even if designers hold shows in many districts. 
FNW: How many shows or events are planned?
SD: We have 30 designers, including a few prominent names like Dice Kayek, or Hakaan Yildirim, who won ANDAM in 2010, and some great emerging designers. Plus, we open the season with New Gen with six fashion graduates; and also have Karma, a joint show for three emerging designers under one umbrella. There is a philanthropic part, since each designer gets financial support to make videos.
 
FNW: What innovations are you most excited about in next week’s season?
SD: We are in charge of producing the season but we let the designers choose and create their own formats. It’s a very independent season. Plus we have developed a digital showroom, where Joor is our partner. That allows our designers to tap into new markets. Reaching buyers who could never make it to Istanbul, like getting a Korean buyer for a Turkish designer. Our season is always in competition with other fashion weeks to attract buyers and journalists, so by doing more digital partnerships we help to overcome that burden.
 
FNW: Who are some of your favorite local designers?
SD: I’d rather not just pick out a few favorites, there are so many I admire.
 
FNW: Is the designer Zeynep Erdogan any relation to Mehmet Erdogan, Turkey’s president?
SD: Just a coincidence. Erdogan is a very popular last name in Turkey – like saying Smith.
 
FNW: What’s the next step for Istanbul fashion?
SD: Establishing our Turkish Fashion Council. We had our first meeting, and hope to set it up later this year. It will guide and help develop the industry and our designers. And changing the mix to include brands that achieved global recognition in recent years. In accessories: Misela, Manu Atelier, Begum Khan and Mehry Mu; or in ready-to-wear: Les Benjamins, In the Mood for Love, Gül Hürgel, Nackiye and Siedres.
 
And, next season, along with adding new brands, we are also planning to organize a Turkish design exhibition in Paris during Paris fashion week.

"Apr 8, 2021","New York-based department store retailer Saks Fifth Avenue has announced that it is closing its fur salons and plans to stop selling all products made using animal fur by the beginning of 2023. 
According to the retailer, its fur salons, which sell and offer a range of cleaning, repair and storage services for fur products, will close by the end of its current fiscal year, which ends January 29, 2022. The closure will be implemented across both physical locations and e-commerce.
 
Saks is the latest U.S. department store retailer to stop selling fur, following in the footsteps of Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom. This movement reflects a wider shift in the luxury and fashion industries, with a number of big-name designer brands – including Armani, Michael Kors, Versace, Burberry, Gucci and Prada – having discontinued the use of fur in their products over the past few years.The movement has even had an effect on legislation: the state of California banned the sale of new fur clothing and accessories in 2019, with the law set to come into effect in 2023. Both New York and Hawaii are also discussing proposed bans.
 
“We recognize that trends constantly evolve, and that the sale of fur remains a significant social issue,” said Saks Fifth Avenue chief merchandising officer Tracy Margolies in a statement cited by Bloomberg. “As such, eliminating it from our assortment is the right step for us to take at this time.”
 
In March, Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson’s Bay announced that it is planning to split the department store chain’s e-commerce operations off as a separate entity. The decision follows a $500 million investment from private equity firm Insight Partners in Saks’ online business.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 7, 2021","Lacoste, the brand known for its crocodile emblem, will launch its '90s revival inspired collaborative collection with Walk in Paris on April 9. The brand partnered with Walk in Paris’ design duo Léo Handtschoewercker, known as Léo Walk, and Gary Neveu, who have both headed their ready-to-wear brand since 2013.The collaborative collection is designed to resonate with the generation of the two designers who said, “We were born in the '90s and the first time we saw Lacoste was in the playground.” This inspiration manifests in the form of an upcycled capsule wardrobe made from Lacoste pieces from the '80s recovered from various thrift stores and reworked with new cuts and materials.
 
The design duo made a total of 11 pieces for the collection, produced in ultra-limited edition quantities. Garments include Lacoste’s iconic polo shirt as well as a retro cap, two bucket hats, an old-school style sweater, two pairs of fitted trousers, a tracksuit, and a number of zip-up jackets.“A versatile and poetic wardrobe” is how Lacoste describes the collection. “Small touches and full looks in cream, chestnut, red berry, and crocodile green blend into each other to form a vintage aesthetic intended for all generations.”

"Apr 2, 2021","And so the countdown begins for sneaker fans! Converse has joined forces with Kim Jones on a luxury-infused version of the brand's emblematic sneaker style, the Chuck 70. But hopefuls will have to move quickly to get their hands on these sneakers which, once again, are likely to fly off the shelves when they drop, April 8.The love affair between pop culture and luxury labels is far from over. After Prada and adidas or Off-White and Nike, Converse has now unveiled a collaboration that's sure to make a buzz. The brand has teamed up with the Dior Men's artistic director Kim Jones, to reinterpret its most emblematic sneaker style -- the Chuck 70 -- with a partially transparent design. 

Once a go-to shoe for the punk-rock generation, the Chuck 70 is looking more streetwear than ever thanks to creative input from Kim Jones, who worked alongside the Converse design team. These luxury-version sneakers feature a transparent TPU cage and a trompe-l'oeil sole, which looks like a platform. Another key detail is the Kim Jones name on the tongue and sockliner.Like adidas and Nike, Converse has launched a series of eagerly awaited collaborations with major fashion houses and renowned designers. After Comme des Garçons and Rick Owens -- who completely transformed the Chuck 70 with a punk-inspired version -- Kim Jones is the latest creative to celebrate the brand's iconic styles.

The limited-edition sneakers go on sale April 8 on Converse.com and will reportedly be joined by accompanying apparel.

"Apr 1, 2021","Designer Zhou Li took to the stage amid applause following her runway show at China Fashion Week with a prop that has political overtones: a bouquet of cotton plants.“As far as I’m concerned, I think Xinjiang cotton is my sweetheart, my love, which is to say I’m very grateful it has brought me such happiness,” Zhou, 56, told Reuters after her show on Tuesday in Beijing.

Zhou, chief designer and founder of Chinese fashion brand Sun-Bird, is a patriotic supporter of a boycott targeting several major western apparel brands in China that have expressed concern over alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang province.She said her garments on show on Tuesday, which featured slick minimalist designs with ruffles and ancient Chinese characters, used Xinjiang cotton exclusively.

“For our Chinese designs, I’m certainly right to support the Xinjiang people,” she said.

H&M, Burberry, Adidas and Nike are among those hit by consumer boycotts in China after their comments on alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang resurfaced on Chinese social media last week.

The backlash has put the brands in an awkward position given the importance of the market in China, where news and social media are tightly controlled by the Communist Party-controlled government and patriotic campaigns targeting foreign brands are common.

“First of all, as everyone knows, these are false statements (from the brands)”, 19-year old fashion model Zhao Yinuo said outside the event. “But of course I can’t comment too much on this because it involves political issues.”

“I have a sense of national pride,” she said.

The European Union, the United States, Britain and Canada last week imposed sanctions on Chinese officials, accusing them of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. China retaliated with sanctions of its own on lawmakers and academics.

Xinjiang produces around 20% of the world’s cotton.

Some researchers and lawmakers say Xinjiang authorities use coercive labour programmes to meet seasonal cotton picking needs. China strongly denies the claims, and says all labour in Xinjiang is consensual and contract-based.

“I can’t believe our Chinese Communist Party would ever do such a thing,” said a 19-year old student surnamed Li at the fashion event. “Our nation is very united.”© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Apr 1, 2021","In today’s world, many country pride themselves on their prestigious design colleges, though few fashion schools anywhere have allied themselves as successfully with high tech, sustainability and digital printing as Shenkar College in Israel. 
Founded in 1970, Shenkar is the nation’s leading college of engineering, design and art; whose fashion school’s most famous alumnus is the great Alber Elbaz.
 
This week, students from several years at Shenkar staged a joint show during Tel Aviv Fashion Week, unveiling a half dozen notably gifted young talents. Shenkar is consistently ranked among the top 20 fashion colleges in the world, and one can see why from this joint show.Mingling elements of sustainability, street-style and recycling the show was one of some 28 online video fashion displays in the four-day Tel Aviv season that ends Thursday, April 1.
 
Dolev Elron caught the eye immediately with his dramatic voluminous denim, a clever take on curvilinear jeans couture. Do pay attention, Renzo Rosso. While Gal Yosef took outlandish proportions to a new level, with artfully constructed gothic style.  
 
Maayan Galili produced some tremendous patchwork rock legend coats; Lera Dror invented eye-catching leather fantasies – with oodles of dystopian dash; and Nika Yakubov unveiled some marvelous waxed and painted denim idea that cried out for a Grammy Award red carpet. 
Shenkar’s fashion section is directed by Ilan Beja, a graduate of the college, who in a busy career has been a ready-to-wear designer; senior merchandiser and creative director before taking charge of the department.
 
So, we spoke to Ilan about directing students during the pandemic; harnessing Israel’s high-tech strengths and how the country’s recent normalization with gulf nations might alter the future of Israel and fashion.
 
FashionNetwork.com: What sets Shenkar apart from other fashion schools?
Ilan Beja: The curriculum in the department encourages personal, original and creative expression in all areas of the fashion world.  A designer, as in any other field in the design world and perhaps even more, must be contemporary, sensitive to all the changes and developments around him and at the same time familiar with the local and international cultural heritage. It is also a winning combination of dedicated team of lecturers and experts, the diverse collaborations we have, fashion design projects that prepare them for the real world, high technical skills, students who strive for excellence from the small place in Israel on the way between Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan (the high-tech satellite city, known as Little Baghdad), artistic freedom and ... hard work.
 
FNW: Your fashion department is within a design college; how does that help develop your students?
IB: We have courses for which we collaborate with the Textile Design Department like print and weaving; lecturers from the Industrial Design Department and the Visual Communication Department are participating in some of our courses. Next year, we plan to collaborate with the School of Multidisciplinary Art. One of the highlights of the collaborations within Shenkar was a final year project in 2020 by students of fashion design and electrical engineering who created clothing systems that respond to music in space.
 
FNW: Israel is known for its advanced technology. What synergies are there with fashion; and with Shenkar?
IB: Thanks for asking. We just had a fashion installation that combines fashion and technology at the Eretz Israel Museum called 'Tech Couture.' Students, alumni and lecturers introduced garments and products that deal with the connection between fashion and technology whether it is in 3D software, virtual fashion design, smart garments, technological sustainability, digital prints, applications for retail world and more. We are promoting these topics in the coming year and are constantly adapting the curriculum to the contemporary arena of local and global fashion.
 
FNW: Do you believe that the recent normalization between Israel and Gulf countries will affect the fashion industry in Israel?
IB: I think there will definitely be explorations from both sides, like other industries in Israel. There are already plans for a few fashion weeks. We need to adjust some differences but as in any relationship if both sides are interested then we find the compromise. 
FNW: Diesel has now created an award for Shenkar students. How did that come about? How does it operate?
IB: It started a few years ago. We were privileged to visit the Diesel offices with the generous hospitality of Renzo Rosso due the time our graduate Niran Aviser worked there. This was renewed after Noa Baruch won the prestigious Diesel award in the ITS competition, and we thought it appropriate to collaborate with them again with our jeans project. We turned to Diesel Israel's head buyer, Seymour Luzon, who connected us to Keren Gabay, marketing director, and Diesel Israel CEO Matti Polak, who embraced us and donated their time and energy. Together we had a great meeting with Rina Tollio, creative talent acquisition for the OTB group. She discovered the outstanding talents in the course and at the end handed out four valuable prizes on behalf of Diesel.
 
FNW: How many fashion students do you have? How many graduates annually?
IB: We have 220-240 in all four years; about 50 graduates annually.
 
FNW: How did you become the director of the fashion department?
IB: I worked in the local and international fashion industry for almost 30 years after graduating with honors in fashion design from Shenkar. I started as a fashion designer for tailored and casual men's wear and my last job was VP of merchandising and creative director in one of the biggest fashion groups in Israel. However, throughout the years, thanks to Leah Peretz, former head of the fashion design department, I taught one day a week. 
After all these years I had great experience in design, management and education. A year and a half ago I was appointed head of the fashion design department. Then Covid-19, the lockdowns, changed the entire world.  In a few days we had to manage the crisis, change the entire curriculums together and replace frontal learning with online learning. I am glad to say that the students finished the year with all the academic commitments we promised them.

"Mar 30, 2021","LVMH has revealed the names of the 20 semi-finalists in this year’s LVMH Prize, which for the first time will take place via a digital platform and allows the public to vote on the award. 
“This year the public becomes the expert,” stressed LVMH in its release. The general public will be able to cast their votes on the site lvmhprize.com, where the 20 semi-finalists will display their collections from April 6 to April 11.
 
The semi-final is mainly judged by a jury of some 50 experts: prominent editors, models, style leaders, key retailers, make-up artists and fashion educators. This year, a half dozen boldface names have joined the committee of experts, including tennis champion, Naomi Osaka, who has also been named ambassador of this edition, and who will accompany the award to its final.Five other personalities have joined the prestigious Expert Committee: model Bella Hadid; Harper's Bazaar US editor-in-chief Samira Nasr; actress Léa Seydoux; Vogue Paris fashion director Aleksandra Woroniecka; and Margaret Zhang, editor-in-chief of Vogue China. While the public’s vote will count as one expert in the final tally.
 
“This semi-final will be entirely digital, and we wanted to open it to the greatest number of people: for the first time, the LVMH Prize will give the public the opportunity to discover the 20 semi-finalists on the lvmhprize.com website and to vote for the candidate of their choice,” explained Delphine Arnault, the brainchild behind the LVMH Prize.
 
Testifying to the global interest in the LVMH Prize, which was launched in 2013, the 20 young hopefuls emerged from a field of 1,900 candidates, who filed applications from some 110 countries. 
The semi-finalists this year are spread across 12 countries: China, France, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States and, for the first time, Albania and Colombia.
 
The 20 include a mixture of happening young stars and somewhat obscure talent. The largest contingent are based in Britain: Alicia Robinson of AGR; Bianca Saunders; America’s Conner Ives; Saul Nash; Albania’s Nensi Dojaka; and Amy Trinh and Evan Phillips of Wed – all of whom live in London.
 
Certainly the most noted so far in their careers must be Charles de Vilmorin, an acclaimed talent recently appointed artistic director of Rochas, and based in Paris; and Christopher John Rogers, one of two New York designers along with Kidsuper's Colm Dillane. They join two Italians, Federico Cina and Andreas Steiner, an Italian designer based in Paris; and two designers based in Shanghai: Rui Zhou and Shuting Qiu.
 
There are also two Tokyo-based talents: Takuya Morikawa, who has garnered impressive plaudits for his brand Taakk; and Taku Midorikawa. Five other designer complete the score: Kika Vargas, a Colombian designer based in Bogota; Adeju Thompson, a Nigerian designer of genderless collections, based in Lagos; Lukhanyo Mdingi from Cape Town; Dongjoon Lim, a menswear creator from Seoul and Cynthia Merhej, a Lebanese designer of womenswear based in Beirut. 
“All the semi-finalists have incorporated a responsible stance in their creative vision: use of innovative or traditional materials, upcycling, recycled fibers, artisanal and local approaches. These initiatives echo the shift in the fashion and luxury industries. Among the semi-finalists, seven do womenswear, five menswear, and two do both womenswear and menswear. Six of them design genderless collections. This edition also saw the return of knitwear, body-conscious garments and the celebration of color among certain designers,” added Arnault, a senior executive within LVMH, and the only daughter of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and controlling shareholder of the giant luxury goods conglomerate.
 
As is the tradition, the 20 semi-finalists will be whittled down to eight finalists after April 11, who will then present their collections in person to a final jury composed of senior designers within LVMH and several senior executives. Due to the pandemic the date of the final and the announcement of the winners still has to be decided.
 
All told, there are five prizes: The LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers with a €300,000 endowment and benefits from a one-year bespoke mentorship program provided by a dedicated LVMH team. The Karl Lagerfeld/Special Jury Prize that rewards a young designer with €150,000 and a mentorship program. And finally three prizes for young fashion-school graduates who have completed their studies in 2020 or 2021 by allocating them, as well as their school, a €10,000 grant. The prize-winning graduates will also join the creative studio of an LVMH house for one year.

"Mar 26, 2021","Fashion Week Tel Aviv celebrates its 10th anniversary this coming week, with four days of shows in a digital season, as a new generation of local design talent begins to capture international attention.The season comes after Israel normalized relations with several Gulf states in the region, leading to a massive burst of travel to Gulf states like Dubai, and heavy shopping sprees by tens of thousands of Israeli, before the country went into another lockdown.
 
Though few nations have vaccinated as high a proportion of their populations, the season will be entirely digital. It kicks off for four days on Monday, and includes such happening local talent as Adish,  a Tel-Aviv based, Israeli-Palestinian brand that seeks to merge the cultural heritage and handcrafts of the Middle East with contemporary silhouettes. Adish, which is stocked by Dover Street Market and MyTheresa, was founded as a collaborative effort between Israeli designers Amit Luzon and Eyal Eliyahu, Palestinian-American artist Jordan Nassar, and Palestinian, Ramallah-based Qussay.For the sixth year, Fashion Week Tel Aviv will host a slew of eight young designers supported by the national lottery, MiFal HaPais, with two group shows. With 28 shows on the busy calendar, the week will also include more established names like Vivi Bellaish, Alon Livne, Dorin Frankfurt and Kedem Sasson. All events in the season are pre-recorded, shot at the Eretz Israel Museum, known for its archeological collections.
 
The season also includes a collective show from students at Shenkar, the advanced engineering, design and art college. Shenkar’s fashion department can boast such notable graduates as the globally acclaimed Alber Elbaz, and the award-winning jewelry designer Michal Kadar of the Cadar brand.
 
Moreover, tapping into the Israeli high-tech sector, and the drive for sustainable fashion, the season is supported by Kornit, the advanced digital textile printing market leader.
 
So, we caught up with Motty Reif, the founder of Fashion Week Tel Aviv, who will officially open the season with ubermodel Bar Rafaeli at a Sunday evening gala, without a live audience, for his take on what makes the Tel Aviv season so special. 
FashionNetwork.com: What’s been the most difficult issues about mounting a fashion week during the pandemic?
Motty Reif: Launching a fashion week during a pandemic was an amazing opportunity to do it without a live audience, which allowed the designers to think out of the box - instead of regular runway shows, each of them had to think how they wanted to showcase their collection. We shot in 29 different locations at the Eretz Israel Museum, an important cultural institution in Tel Aviv. I don’t believe I will ever go back to producing a traditional fashion runway event ever again. The result is by far more beautiful, special, interesting and each designer had the opportunity to fly.
 
FNW: What sets apart Fashion Week Tel Aviv from other seasons in the region, or elsewhere?
MR: I think what sets us apart is our belief in inclusivity within the fashion industry.  It’s always been critical to us to contribute to important matters and agendas. The diversity we impart is the crown of Fashion Week Tel Aviv. Every age, gender, race, religion and size are included. It was a goal that I set myself a few years ago and this year we’ve had a big victory. Everyone can see his or herself during the shows.
 
FNW: What does Kornit Digital plan to add to the season?
MR: I see the Kornit family as a godsend. Because all the young emerging designers are fighting with the issue of production time after time. Kornit will enable them to get as creative as possible and to use Kornit’s innovative technology to produce their collections on-demand – only producing what has been sold. This change in the fashion eco-system has not only enabled sustainable on-demand production in Israel, but also around the world. It’s only the beginning and Kornit’s fashion printing technology is going to change the world. This is a historic moment for the industry. 
FNW: What is Shenkar college planning?
MR: Shenkar is a design school in Israel and every year we dedicate one of the shows to their fashion students, giving them a chance to show their work during Fashion Week Tel Aviv.
 
FNW: How many buyers, editors or influencers do you expect to attend?
MR: Each designer has their own network of buyers, editors and influencers from around the world, however as this year has not been a live event, none have been in physical attendance.
 
FNW: What brands are you most excited about in next week’s season?
MR: They are all my kids. I love them all.
 
FNW: How did you become CEO of Fashion Week Tel Aviv?
MR: It started when I lived in LA and moved back to Tel Aviv in 2011. The idea came from wanting to show the other side of Israel. You read only about the conflicts and I wanted to show the beautiful side. I know my people and so I thought if I bring journalists to Tel Aviv and show them Israel and all its beauty we would have an audience to showcase its unique fashion talent. We brought over 100 international journalists to immerse them in our incredible creative culture.

"Mar 25, 2021","“I realized that in the past few years, everyone reacts to sincere things. When you do something that you really believe in, and not just for commercial reasons, people react. It’s a really, really thin line, but people understand,” argues Roger Vivier Artistic Director Gherardo Felloni, explaining his provocative new collection video for the famed shoe brand. 
Felloni named his footwear flick 'Do We Show?,' a meditation on a show that never takes place, and a satirical social commentary on what is happening in the fashion and luxury since the pandemic started.
 
“I wanted to touch on this Covid situation, but with humor, as I am not a politician. Nobody has really commented on Covid in our world,” Felloni argued.So, the show begins with fiver doppelgängers of five icons - Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Grace Kelly and Edith Piaf, a figure who cannot really sing. Five fashion fanatics perched on gold Louis XVI couture chairs with pink cushions. For Josephine sequined booties; while for Marilyn diamanté slippers and heels.
 
“Get those fucking lights on me,” screams Marilyn; while Dietrich, cigarette in hand, looks down her Teutonic nose to her dominatrix boots in black patent leather with stiletto heels, which Roger Vivier is credited with inventing. All waiting before a stage with just a giant terracotta vase of red flowers, before they all gradually stagger on to the stage and, well, die. 
“Could you do it again a little more real?” requests the director, played by Felloni, a bearded Tuscan, born in Arezzo, a city whose earlier residents include Petrarch, Michelangelo and Vasari.

Each of his stars are all linked to the house; Marlene was a very close friend of Roger Vivier, who drew a special diamanté ball heel named the Marlene. He was also a very good pal of Edith; as a teenager, Vivier had been to see Baker perform in Paris, and he would go on to shod Monroe. While the character playing Kelly, in real life a very active client, wears nubby-toed floral pumps.
 
“Why do they die? Because if you are a performer and don’t have an audience that’s the same as dying, no?” cackles Felloni, dressed in black with a late 19th-century cameo pendant of Hercules.
 
The result was a collection rich in proportion and polish: spike-heel electric-blue satin boots; patent-leather boots with the house’s signature big rectangular buckle; or sensational nylon tulle booties laced with crystals and topped with cock feathers.
For day, biker boots with thick brothel-creeper soles and rectangular side buckles added a touch of real. As did the new version of their house’s clutch with the brand name embossed at the back.
 
For the presentation, Felloni developed seven toiles, pairing each with footwear and showing them all before pink satin curtains. Voluminous New Look dresses and robes with a twist; ideas made in denim or canvas. 
After studying biology at university, Felloni, a gifted illustrator, began designing for his father’s shoe factory. Before going on to join Prada and Miu Miu, and spending over four years with Dior, straddling the reigns of John Galliano and Raf Simons.
 
“Once Patrizio Bertelli told me I had to design 100 pairs of shoes for the following day. So, the next day, at 11 a.m., he had 115 sketches, and I said, ‘take these!,” chuckles Felloni with pride.
 
He joined Roger Vivier – which is owned by Tod’s and Italian luxury billionaire Diego Della Valle - in 2018, going on to develop an opulent style that continually references the house’s innovative shapes and lasts. For Felloni, the brand’s DNA is clear, a close link to cinema and film stars.
 
“Roger Vivier’s lasts and heels are never banal, as he works on pure shapes.
But what’s crucial here is savoir-faire. He was a genius designer, but also technically very relevant. And rarity! It is not a brand selling millions of pairs, but it is rare. You can find something here that you cannot find in other boutiques, which is something that Diego della Valle always encourages,” he insists.

"Mar 23, 2021","Hedi Slimane has opened a photography exhibition in Shanghai, the first of his photo shows in China. 
Entitled Sun of Sound, the exhibition marks the first photo show of his work in over seven years, when he exhibited inside the Fondation Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent in Paris in 2014.
 
This personal exhibition by Slimane, the creative director of Celine in Paris, is being staged in the Almine Rech Gallery, located in the hyper central Huangpu district of Shanghai, from March 19 to April 30. It’s a 4,000-square-foot space in the Amber Building, a former Bank of China warehouse.Curiously, the press release for the exhibition describes Slimane as the “acclaimed French multi-disciplinary artist, photographer, and fashion designer,” in that order.
 
Slimane first began taking photographs when he was 11, and his subject matter focuses on artistic youth in private moments, or rock stars captured in dive bars, after-hours clubs or dingy dressing rooms. Invariably shot in direct and unadulterated black and white. 
“Music has a sense of freedom that continues to inspire me. I have never found anything else that has the same capacity to impact on popular culture,” said Slimane in a release.
 
The exhibition extends from 2006, capturing everyone from skateboarders to clubbers, jumping between LA, London and Paris, to a series of older iconic survivors like Lou Reed, Joni Mitchell, Keith Richards, John Lyndon, and Jane Birkin.
 
“I like a ‘simple’ photograph, one that does not pretend to be anything other than a captured moment in someone’s life,” added the designer, who has helmed such illustrious brands as Dior Men and Yves Saint Laurent.

"Mar 22, 2021","Seoul Fashion Week kicked off on Monday, with an entirely virtual format, plenty of activity and a new ambassador inside the Korean capital.With new central locations and over 40 designers, the season began livestreaming this morning, principally from runways inside the National Museum of Korea and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art.
 
Backed by Seoul Metropolitan Government, Seoul Fashion Week will run from March 22 to 27. This season, it named actress and activist Bae Doona to be its new ambassador. One of the icons of Louis Vuitton’s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière, Bae Doona has already begun appearing in promo videos broadcast in New York’s Times Square.All told, designers will unveil their ideas in five different locations, including  Seonyudo Park and the Oil Tank Culture Park. In other innovations, outdoor catwalk events will be filmed by using drones. Leenalchi, an alternative band famous for its song Tiger is Coming, will perform at the opening ceremony, and DJ Peggy Gou will perform at the finale.
 
Ever since Gangnam Style took the world by storm, K-pop heroes won global followings and Korean brands of the ilk of Wooyoungmi and Muun began winning critical raves, fashion insiders have paid particular attention to Korea.
 
So we caught up with Jeon Mi-kyung, the very busy director of Seoul Fashion Week, for her take on what’s new and different in Korea.
 
 
FashionNetwork.com: Why have you decided to move locations? 
Jeon Mi-kyung: When the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a masterpiece of Zaha Hadid, was opened, fashion people in Seoul were unable to hide their excitement and were extremely grateful that such a wonderful space could be used as a fashion week stage. But after seven years, compared to other fashion weeks with runways in historical and symbolic venues throughout the city, Seoul Fashion Week's runway seemed rather limited, many designers wanted to showcase their collections in a new space. The global pandemic situation eased the burden of a huge physical event arrangement gathering the international press, buyers and VIP and we thought about expanding the runways to all parts of Seoul. We wanted to turn locations that encapsulate the diverse charms of Seoul into runways, where designers could express their ideas in a free way. Thanks to the support of Seoul Metropolitan Government, we could use places such as the National Museum of Korea, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) that have not been used for those type of events before. This experience offered a new energy for designers who were somewhat exhausted by Covid-19 situation. We will keep finding more beautiful and diverse spaces in various parts of Seoul and turn them into show stages. 
What innovations are you most excited about in next week’s season? 
Unlike February 2020, where we were under obligation to cancel the fashion week in preparation, we now know which direction to take. Physical runways cannot be the only option anymore. We’ll take these uncertain times as an opportunity to bring something new to SFW. In addition to runways, SFW and Korean brands will, through various projects, show the potential of Seoul.
 
Why have you chosen Bae Doona to be your ambassador? 
Bae Doona is the first ever South Korean brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton and creative director Nicolas Ghesquière's muse. She is also considered a representative actress in Korea who has appeared in various movies, including the works of Oscar winning director Bong Joon-ho. As SFW will be offering a digital experience, Korean designers regret not being able to meet foreign press & buyers. To overcome this “pandemic reality”, promoting SFW through a global icon as influential as Bae Doona was important. And as a fashionista representing the Korean fashion scene, she did not hesitate to join us.
 
How many shows are planned? 
Twenty-six brands for Seoul Collection and 17 for Next Generation.
 
How many events are planned? 
 Leenalchi, one of the latest sensations in the Korean music scene, will be the opening headliner and globally known DJ Peggy Gu will perform on the finale stage.  
 
Will any events be actually live? 
Runways and events have been pre-produced and will be livestreamed through each channel during SFW. Some live-commerce by KOL will take place, after SFW. 
  
Is Seoul Fashion Week a private company or an industry federation? How does it operate? 
Unlike other weeks, SFW is sponsored by the Seoul Metropolitan Government without any private partners: The Seoul Metropolitan Government supports the budget and the general director of SFW is in charge of the overall supervision and direction. 
What is your budget? 
About 5 billion won (€3.7 billion) per year.
 
How many buyers, editors or influencers do you expect to attend? 
We are making various efforts to attract more people. We expect to hit the highest number, taking advantage of digital tools.
 
Who are your ten favorite designers? 
Aimons by Jaehyun Kim: Even before the international press started to have any interest in SFW, Jaehyun Kim has always been one of the most loved Korean designers by international buyers. She rejoined SFW last season after a gap of some years and we are more than happy to host her on our runways again. Both Bae Doona and Peggy Gou will be wearing Aimons - it highlights the popularity of Aimons in Korea and we are really excited about this brand.
 
Others are: Partsparts, for its sustainable collection; Beyond Closet, one of  brands that Korean celebrities love to wear; Seokwoon Yoon, SFW’s rising rookie; A Bell with its virtual runway; Hanacha, for its conceptual collection; Painters, which shows creativity and youthful get-up-and-go; Notknowing, already a favorite on the street style scene; and BMuet(te) and Lie with their stable collections appreciated by buyers.
 
How did you become director of Seoul Fashion Week? 
When I was in the fashion magazine industry (including at Elle Korea, Vogue Korea and Harper’s Bazaar Korea) I experienced countless fashion weeks in Paris, New York, London and Milan. I still remember how I was surprised, touched and envious while covering those fashion weeks. My belief that Seoul would one day be reborn as a global fashion city and my wish to transform SFW as a platform that fits its global status led me, I believe, to the position of director of Seoul Fashion Week. The moment where the well-executed and creative works of Korean designers and the sophisticated K-culture will shine the global market is not that far away!

"Mar 22, 2021","Taipei Fashion Week wrapped up its autumn/winter 2021 edition on March 15, showcasing the latest collections from the Asian nation’s most established designers, as well as offerings from its local emerging designer pool.Kicking off on March 10, the biannual, six-day fashion event took place at the official venue Songshan Cultural and Creative Park, and offsite outdoor areas, in Taipei. Back by the Taiwanese government, the event was hailed as the world’s first fashion week to have physical shows with a live audience in Covid-19 times; an big feat considering the impact the pandemic has already had on the physical fashion show formats in majors Milan, Paris, London and New York.
 
Over the course of the week, some 18 designers showcased their autumn/winter 2021 collections across 14 individual shows. That included two ‘Young Talent-Student’ showcases, marking the first partnership between the Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Education and a several fashion design students from Ling Tung University, Shu-Te University, Fu Jen Catholic University and Shih Chien University. 
The latest Taipei Fashion Week opened with the ‘Taipei Sustainable Collections’, a show made up young designers with existing sustainable practices and “who balance care for the environment with a humanity-first approach to design to find the intersection of style, innovation and social responsibility,” said event organisers, in a statement.
 
The six brands to take part in the sustainability show were Berlin-founded streetwear brand #Damur; designer Claudia Wang; and local brands Just In XX, DYCTeam, Weavism, and OqLiq.

Sourced from local textile industries, each collection featured an array of eco-friendly sustainable textile and fabric technologies, such as recycled scrap tires, upcycled fish scales, and oyster shells. Sustainable sourcing was also the theme of the week. A motion seconded by the attendance of two local manufacturing industry heavyweights: chairman of Formosa Plastics Group, William Wong; and chairman of construction's Far Eastern Group, Douglas Hsu – a nod of support for a new era in made-in-Taiwan fashion.  

Another highlight was the latest offering from indie brand Uuin, founded by designers Tzutsao Liu, Andrea Liu and Van Lin. The trio’s ‘The Gardeners’ collection highlighted how citizens need to unite to resist chaos during the pandemic; reimagining a bright, colourful, and energetic future, on the back of the shadows cast by Covid-19. The brand also teamed up with British footwear brand Hunter and New York luxury brand Steven Madden for accessories in the show. 
Other shows of note were local brand Allenko3, which sent out its ‘90: Evolution’ collection; deconstructing student uniforms for a demonstration of “orderly rebellion,” and brand Seivson, which questioned the fate of the future through a conceptual blend of avant-garde design and feminine postures which perfectly presented ""women's power.""

Closing out the last day of the week, designer Bob Jian held his ‘Temple Fairs’ collection inside a dimly lit, laser-centric Songshan Cultural warehouse. Inspired by the designer's childhood memory of temple fairs, the collection was a modern translation of traditional costumes, seen in the colourful combinations of oriental patterns and the masks of eight religious advance guards.
 
While the 14 shows were attended by a live audience this season, Covid-19 regulations and social distancing measures remained threaded into the weave of the week.
 
So much so that organisers teamed up with CSD -- one of Taiwan’s largest face mask manufacturers -- to launch four face masks with design patterns symbolising Taiwanese aesthetics including ethnic weaving, indigo dyeing, plum flower, and traditional window grill.

"Mar 20, 2021","Weaving contemporary designs into a traditional West African fabric, Nigerian Tsemaye Binitie is creating fashion he hopes can also bridge the gap between luxury and the everyday.His material of choice is Aso-oke, a hand-woven cloth indigenous to the Yoruba people and historically used on special occasions.

Binitie, who cut his teeth as a design assistant with Stella McCartney in 2005, began using the fabric in 2017, and he infuses the yellow dresses that are his signature creations with cottons and silks to give them a post-modern feel.“We started to use contemporary African art and culture within the threads of the collection so you see hints of it or very ... obvious (signs),” said Binitie, who divides his time between Lagos and London.

“It’s sort of informed fabric, informed colour, informed styling.”

Priced at between $300 and $4,000, his TB12 custom collection features Aso-oke – which means “top cloth” in Yoruba - in seven different shades.

“We are sort of preserving the culture, you know, that we’ve watched all our lives in front of us ... and teaching the younger generation that it is something to be proud of, something to want to wear,” he told Reuters.

Fellow Lagos designer Lisa Folawiyo specialises in a different traditional cloth, the West African wax prints known as Ankara, and her hybrid collection, called Batkara, incorporates Batik designs embellished with needle-work beadings and sequin trimmings. “We have merged what is indigenous to us with what is familiar in the West and we’ve made it ours,” she said.

That same synthesis informs the aesthetic of Alara, a Lagos store dedicated to showcasing contemporary African fashion for the Nigerian and the diaspora markets. Its Head of Partnerships, Arinola Fagbemi, says more and more people are thinking about African luxury “in terms of how we live on a day-to-day basis ... not just for celebratory moments.”

"Mar 16, 2021","Paris may be dominated by giant bold face name luxury fashion marques, but a key to keeping the City of Light at the top of the heap when it comes to fashion capitals is the ability to discover exciting new talent. We caught up with four diverse young designers that created noteworthy collection in this March’s videos and presentations, dedicated to fall/winter 2021. Kenneth Ize: Aso oke attitudesKenneth Ize is the great hope of West African fashion. Of Nigerian origin, Ize grew up in Austria, became a star in Lagos Fashion Week, and went on to become a LVMH Prize finalist.His key signature is his material of choice: aso oke, meaning top cloth, a hand-woven fabric created by the Yoruba people, with beautifully graphic grids and punchy geometry. Which Kenneth has already employed in great yachting blazers; rock-star jackets and guitar-hero overalls.
 
Though primarily noted as a menswear designer, Ize has plenty of design chops when it comes to womenswear too. This season in Paris Fashion Week, he displayed an assured fashion video, with two models – one guy, one girl – posing in turn before a series of hanging blankets, to a jangling guitar soundtrack.
 
The lady in diagonal-print aso oke sheath dresses; mannish gray cotton suits or evil-eye print party frocks. The young gent in tobacco-hued aso oke tunics; great geometric-print Eisenhowers and sensational multi-stripe, four-pocket dusters.
 
Directed by Joshua Woods and styled by Kyle Keese, this video felt as much like a CV as a fashion statement. Someone should really name Ize creative director of a historic European house and let this talent rip.
 
 Alexandre Blanc: Voluptuous volumesSeveral fledgling labels were part of Sphere, the incubator program for young designers supported by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body.
 
Due to the pandemic, Sphere was entirely online, where one could witness  an impressive performance by Alexandre Blanc. Whose designs are quintessentially French; with lots classy and intricate cutting, notably some great polka-dot looks and a divinely cut movie-star flared trench coat. Though Blanc’s best ideas were exotic silk cocktails dresses made in a remarkable neo-classical print, created by the designer himself.
 
Born in Toulouse, the resting place of the great philosopher Thomas Aquinas, Blanc is a thoughtful and highly experienced designer who did stints at
Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga before joining Guillaume Henry in the resurrection of Carven. Since then, Blanc has collaborated with such storied and diverse brands as Jil Sander and Oscar de la Renta.
 
In September 2018, he founded his own brand in Paris. It has an uptown sense of style, but is never uptight. This is a designer very much on an upward trajectory.
 
 Mossi: High fashion in Hautes-NouesFashionistas often just brag about putting something back in, but designer Mossi Traoré really does. His fashion brand and association is all about connecting young people in his outside-of-Paris district with the inner city life of art, culture and fashion.
 
So, the designer shot the video in his own suburban city, Hautes-Noues in Villiers-sur-Marne. Where he has created a high fashion school, Les Ateliers Alix, which trains some 30 students annually in mastering the crafts of corsetry and  embroidery.
 
This season, Mossi sent his inclusive cast strolling around a housing development courtyard in late afternoon sun, as the elders, young mums and families sat down like editors and critics to admire the clobber.
 
For next fall, Mossi wants his gal in white or yellow, polka-dots with blotchy black dots, seen in spruce jackets and leggings; finely drawn graphic long dresses; rouched-up blue cotton shirt dresses and, his snappiest look, technical calico blouse/capes. 
 
The cast, their hair done up in spiky corn rows, intermingling with local skateboarders and toddlers, perched on concrete benches.
 
At the finale, one model in a natty black blazer did a tour on a scooter; before several hoodie guys circled the cast doing wheelies. Barely 10 models but a sharp and cool statement by Mossi, who took his bow dressed in black, and a huge smile surrounded by his dreadlocks.
 
 Minuit: From cocktail hour to ‘round midnightOne marque quietly gathering fans is Minuit, by the French duo of Laurie Arbellot and Marion Ferand who both cut their design teeth in New York working for the likes of Proenza Schouler and Calvin Klein.
 
They showed their second collection in a garden loft in the heart of the Marais, cleverly balancing comfortable modernist style with a soupcon of Parisian seduction.
 
What worked best were the velour-style mannish chalk-stripe pants suit cut with elongated legs, and made to be worn with just a saucy bra. Or their series of semi-sheer chiffon voile tops, skirts and dresses – all destined for a steaming sunset cocktail party.
 
Add in some great evening dresses in an organic Garden-of-Eden print and it made for yet another savvy display by this duo.

"Mar 16, 2021","Following its appointment of British designer Nicholas Knightly as its Creative Director last year, French label Moynat has launched the first designs under his control, along with a campaign that focuses on the bags as the stars of the show.The company is calling it a “fresh page in the beautiful story of our house” and said Knightly “has stepped over the threshold of the Maison to write a new chapter into the feminine, hand-crafted savoir-faire tradition that have been part of the brand since 1849”.

The ultra-luxe brand that evolved from creating hand-made trunks to luxe handbags as well as luggage, has come up with a colourful collection that it says is “a modern exploration of the authentic inheritance of a Parisian luxury Maison, which has been discreetly producing its delightful treasury of bespoke products for modern travellers”. The new campaign features individual bags appearing to be giant-sized in the miniature surround of Parisian interiors.

As far as the new products are concerned, Knightly and the team have used the rich brand archive to inspire a series of bags that mix the old with the new. They include Le Flori, a curved cross-body bag with a removable leather strap. It contains a tribute to Maison Moynat’s origins as a Parisian trunk-maker. The “detail of the top-handle, and the sensual engineering of the lock mechanism are inspired by studying the details of trunks made for women in the 1900s,” it said. 

There’s also Le Limousine, a top-handle bag named in honour of a landmark in Moynat history when in 1902 it made trunks to fit the curves of early automobiles. It comes in pale beige leather.

Meanwhile the top-handle Voyage and bucket-shaped Le Baluchon bags make the most of the “inventiveness of our specialist house lock-masters” with palladium or gold-plated lock centres that are the “Moynat stamp of authenticity, which was first signalled in circular metal stamps hammered onto luggage in the 1930s”. The company said the “tactile button mechanism of the silver-plated Medallion Lock opens and shuts at the push of a finger, a mini-piece of engineering made for modern women on the go”.And the La Toile 1920 pair of bags feature the monogram design originally rendered by painter Henri Rapin in 1920s by contorting the lines of the letter M. The renewed monogram now has a 3D effect, “which is the closest industrial practice to hand painting,” the company said. The spirit of the Art Deco lettering is “written into the stylistic codes through colourful hand-painted stripes and initials newly imagined for the owner,” we’re told. The two bags in this material are La Wheel, a small cylindrical minaudière, and La Little Suitcase, a scaled-down piece of luggage now functioning as a handbag.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 16, 2021","Ralph Lauren is set to livestream its next runway show with help from one of its favorite muses, after choosing not to participate in New York Fashion Week. Titled 'All or Nothing at All', the immersive digital experience is slated for March 25 at 7 p.m. EDT, and will feature a musical performance from Janelle Monáe, who is a muse for the brand. 

The event will be live-streamed on the brand’s website and feature the women’s Ralph Lauren collection and men’s Purple Label line. The general public are invited to view the show from home and will equally have the opportunity to shop the see-now-buy-now collection right from their screens.Similarly, last spring, Lauren didn’t participate in New York Fashion Week in February 2020 with plans to show off-calendar in April 2020, but that show was canceled due to the pandemic.

The brand's last runway presentation was September 2019 where Ralph’s club-themed show was presented in downtown Manhattan. Monáe equally hit the stage as part of the cinematic performance. 

The immersive runway and digital shopping experience is in line with the company’s increased focus on digital marketing. In September, the New York-based fashion house said it would cut 15 percent of its global workforce by the end of this fiscal year, in an effort to move more business online.

Ralph Lauren said it would invest in digital platforms to support e-commerce operations and expand product personalization, following a decrease in sales and altered consumer shopping behaviour due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

The “innovative” site also features graduate portfolio profiles and fashion university information.GFF said the “state of the art, dynamic portal” caters for two distinct functions in the fashion world, “attracting a global audience and capitalising on the growing interest for Graduate Fashion Week”.

Key is its use of technology “to match highly talented graduates to potential future careers in the fashion industry”.During Graduate Fashion Week (12-18 June at Coal Drops Yard, London), the platform will livestream all event content, featuring 11 runway shows, including the GFW International Fashion Show.

It will also include exclusive GFWLIVE! industry panel talks, creative university fashion films, designer diaries and archive footage from the 30 years of GFW. 

Users can also register to view and interact with live-streams and live chats across all venues housed within the portal. This dual functionality means the portal will have two separate designs incorporating the GFW look and feel, GFF noted. 

Firstly, during the build-up to and during Graduate Fashion Week, the site will showcase ""everything the event has to offer"" as well as highlighting the schedule, speakers and universities. Registered users will be able to view all exclusive live-streamed content during the event, mixed with brand partners' messaging and industry conversation. 

Then, from May, industry and media guests can scout talent from over 1,500 curated graduate portfolio profiles when the Graduate Portfolio Profile hub is activated. 

“This pool of talent stands out from other platforms due to its curation of the very best fashion graduates, allowing potential employers from across the industry to view work from 82 global universities”, GFF said. 

Additionally the search function filters the offering to “40 specialisms making it easier for industry to find the next big hire suitable for their needs”. 

The search filters range from sustainability and designing-for-disabilities, to fashion business, marketing and promotion, it added.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 12, 2021","The sound of men punching holes into colourful rubber sheets reverberates across a tiny studio in India's largest slum -- an unlikely birthplace for luxury handbags made by a marginalised community seeking to reclaim its identity.""Chamar Studio"" owes its name, derived from the Sanskrit word for 'skin' and long used locally as a slur, to leather craftsmen who lie at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy.

As members of the Dalit caste, formerly known as untouchables, life has always been a struggle for India's leather workers, who are largely Hindu Chamars or Muslim.Then came Prime Minister Narendra Modi's war on beef consumption, which destroyed their livelihoods by cutting off access to raw materials.

It also raised the threat of lynchings by so-called cow vigilantes -- Hindu hardliners fighting to protect the animal they deem sacred.

""Chamars have been oppressed for so long,"" the brand's founder Sudheer Rajbhar told AFP.

An artist by training, Rajbhar -- who is lower-caste though not Chamar -- sought to offer the community a new lease on life by designing minimalist handbags made of recycled rubber -- a sustainable substitute for leather.

- 'Such a weird name' -

But first he had to weigh the legal risks, after India's Supreme Court banned the ""highly offensive word"" in 2008 over its widespread use as a term of abuse.

Then he had to convince the community, with many craftsmen fearing the potentially incendiary -- and loss-making -- implications of marketing a luxury product with lower-caste associations.

""I thought it was such a weird name for a brand,"" said Rahul Gore, who faced discrimination while growing up in a village 300 kilometres (190 miles) from Mumbai.

""We were allowed to play with upper-caste children but their parents would not allow us to visit them at home or share food. I used to feel very bad about it,"" Gore, now 35, told AFP.

The use of rubber instead of leather meant that virtually every step -- from the cutting to the stitching -- needed to be performed by hand rather than with sewing machines.

The absence of tanning and the use of organic colours to dye the bags in the brand's signature hues of cobalt blue, red and emerald green make the process much less toxic for workers, said Rajbhar.

The purses are so durable they can even withstand a spin in a washing machine, he added.

- 'I get more respect' -

Rajbhar used his savings and bank loans to invest around one million rupees ($13,700) into launching the brand in 2017, turning to local cobbler Sachin Sakhare for help in training craftsmen.

Sakhare started working on Mumbai's crowded pavements as a 13-year-old when his father, also a cobbler, was killed in a hit-and-run accident.

He told AFP he wanted to ""improve the lot of my people"".

""The caste system has created so much discrimination that people just don't respect certain types of work,"" said Sakhare, who used to earn 400 rupees a day as a cobbler.

The father-of-two now leads a team of Chamar and Muslim craftsmen making unisex totes, shoulder bags and clutches, and says his sense of self-worth has expanded.

""Now that I get more respect (for my work), I feel more like an artist"", he added.

The purses don't come cheap, with prices ranging up to 39,000 rupees for an intricately woven oversized tote that takes a day to make.

- 'We are artists' -

Customers have not balked at the cost however, with the bags stocked at high-end boutiques in Mumbai and Frankfurt as well as the brand's own online store.

But the company is confronting new challenges, with sales down since the pandemic.

Many craftsmen remain fearful about returning to Mumbai, the Indian city hit hardest by the coronavirus.

Although Rajbhar's Chamar Foundation has managed to support the families of his employees during India's months-long lockdown, his colleagues worry for the future.

""Why would anyone buy handbags when they are worried about running their households?"" mused Sakhare, who also works as a sweeper to pay the bills.

Still, he refuses to give up hope.

""I never imagined we would make a difference to society,"" he said.

""It feels really good to tell the world that we are Chamar and we are artists.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Mar 12, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic is still rampant in a number of countries, but fashion designers are patently pinning their hopes on a rosier future. Cosy, comfortable clothes still constitute the core of the collections for the Fall/Winter 2021-22 season, featuring plenty of lockdown-friendly knitwear, cocooning coats and ample monochrome suits, with a focus on utilitarian wardrobe essentials. At the same time, the women’s ready-to-wear collections presented virtually in New York, London, Milan and Paris, from February 14 to March 10 2021, clearly gambled on a return to normality, and were infused with an irrepressible yearning for parties and glamour, spawning sparkling, lavish looks.
 JumpsuitsThis essentially utilitarian garment, which has cropped up frequently in recent seasons, especially in men’s collections, has now become a women’s wardrobe staple, presented in a plethora of styles and materials. Styled like a trench coat by Issey Miyake, as a suit by Sportmax and Salvatore Ferragamo, with geometric patterns at Courrèges, zipped at Rick Owens, in suede at Alberta Ferretti.

At Prada, jumpsuits come with a nod to a granddad’s woollen underwear, while Balmain’s interpretation gives it an astronaut/fighter pilot twist. Also featured were skiing jumpsuits (at Chanel, Thom Browne and Emilio Pucci) and an evening version in black lace by Elie Saab.Quilted looks Quilted overcoats and jackets, preferably with voluminous proportions, have earned themselves a permanent slot in women’s wardrobes with their protective, comforting feel. Down jackets were all the rage, both in Alpine versions, with matching anoraks and padded boots, and in the guise of urban overcoats, capes, blankets, sport jackets and gilets.

They are even featured as dresses at Loewe, Marni and Cecilie Bahnsen. Beautiful People transformed a maxi down jacket in a gala garment, Ottolinger in a sculptured overcoat. Jarel Zhang’s quilted jackets can be disassembled, at Rick Owens they are futuristic. Dolce & Gabbana’s oversize down jackets come in glittering leopard print and silver, while they veer towards extra-large sportswear volumes at Givenchy.
 Overshirts Lighter and softer than a jacket, warmer than a traditional shirt, the overshirt is one of the many practical essentials that have gained prominence during lockdown. Overshirts featured discreetly in several collections, from Fendi, in sturdy bouclé wool, to Edward Crutchley’s sophisticated military version. They also featured in leather, wool and cotton, in pastel hues or in the classic check pattern presented by Dsquared2.Schoolgirl looks A black dress with prim white Claudine collar, the typical French schoolgirl look, is something quite reassuring in these uncertain times. It is a look that has greatly inspired designers, blending as it does a kind of classic, slightly bourgeois understatement with echoes of innocence and childhood memories. Christian Dior, Simone Rocha and Bmuet(te) featured black apron dresses worn over white shirts, while the look incorporated a white plastron at N°21 and Giambattista Valli.

Oversize collars with long tips, ruffled collars that extend upwards and frilled collars are a distinctive presence in next winter’s looks. A huge lace collar nearly covers the shoulders in Masha Ma’s black leather mini dress, while a collar embroidered with small black motifs is set over a black polka dot dress at Paco Rabanne.Houndstooth patternsTraditional black and white houndstooth patterns with their classic, conservative feel are back centre-stage, often in imaginatively iconoclastic reinterpretations. Dolce & Gabbana featured the pattern in the pockets of a Teddy Boy jacket or in an oversize goose-foot print. Nina Ricci adopted it in green. At Anrealage, the pattern explodes in a thousand fragments on an overcoat, while Rokh gives it an almost metallic shine.
 Detachable sleevesLong glamorous gloves in endless variants will be next winter’s must-have accessory. Transformed into half-sleeves or into sleeves tout court, to be detached or attached at will, they are the ideal complement of the post-2020 wardrobe, at a time when people have learned to consume less but better.

Detachable woollen sleeves can be chic (as at Paco Rabanne and Giambattista Valli) or practical (at Rick Owens), worn as part of a cute knitted shrug at Dawei, or combined with a sexy tone-on-tone knitted strap dress at Blumarine. Ann Demeulemeester presented them in white poplin to match a shirt and accent the silhouette. 

Elsewhere, detachable sleeves serve to add volume to the arms. And in general, sleeves are increasingly voluminous, they burgeon and balloon, adorned with frills and ruches.A-line dressesPretty A-line dresses, reminiscent of the carefree, frivolous 1960s, are making a come-back in fashion collections, together with trapeze-shaped skirts and overcoats. With their simple, practical geometric shape they evoke both a little-girl look and the Swinging 60s, infusing energy and humour into next winter’s wardrobe.
 Jewel garmentsJewellery will play a starring role in the Fall/Winter 2021-22. It is the perfect way to accent understated, minimalist looks, to add a twist of character to an outfit, and to make it sparkle even through a single detail, like the crystal garter belt glimpsed at Chanel. Jewellery is synonymous with the widespread desire to shine again.

Jewels featured in the collections not simply as impressive statement pieces, as Schiaparelli did so cleverly, they also took over entire garments. A cascade of pearls turns into a plastron at Jil Sander, gemstone sets morph into a top at Paco Rabanne, a pearl-encrusted dress is worn over a bodice at Dolce & Gabbana. And chunky metal chains pop up everywhere, draped around the neck or the body.
 Gold Sequins, rhinestones, pearls, feathers, lamé fabrics and wire mesh: a festive spirit glittered in a number of collections. Many of them featured scores of shimmering silver items, lending the clothes a futuristic sci-fi look, but it is gold that most clearly symbolised the return to luminous looks.

Even the more sombre collections, like those by Calcaterra and Valentino, included at least one or two looks in gold. Sometime it is just a single item, like Chanel’s golden raincoat, Versace’s lamé dress, Alberta Ferretti’s tasselled trousers, Moschino’s snakeskin suit, or the glittering boots by Andrew GN.
 TrainsThere is a craving for parties and sumptuous dresses, and trains have made a grand return in many collections, trailing behind majestic coats, theatre gowns, cocktail frocks and princess dresses, in silk, chiffon and satin, ideally dotted with gems and crystals.

"Mar 11, 2021","Just when you thought that Paris Fashion Week had finally ended, when along comes Alexandre Mattiussi of AMI with a final video show on Thursday. 
One dedicated in large part to the good old days of fashion, back in the '80s, when runway shows suddenly began to grab the attention of a global audience.
 
A time, pre-9/11, when fashion shows didn’t require huge security staff, when photographers were allowed to line every yard of the runway, and not confined to a packed photo pit as they are today. As in AMI’s new show video entitled 'Le Défilé,' French for 'runway show,' which was shot with tremendous punch by the very happening Spanish filmmaker and luxury ad specialist Alvaro Colum.We’re talking about three decades ago and the era of supermodels, just as designers suddenly became global tastemakers; a decade this collection referenced throughout with its big power shoulders and superhero volumes.
 
“I wanted to go back to the time which inspired me to be a designer in the first place. When they first began showing fashion shows on TV when I was a kid. And I was thinking of the designers who were great then, the Wall Street power of Michael Kors, and the big statement fashion of Gianfranco Ferré,” explained AMI’s founder and creative director Alexandre Mattiussi.
 
Never a slouch commercially, the designer even introduced a sleek new padded patent leather lunch box-shaped bag, named 'The Rendezvous,' “as that’s all we can dream about when this lockdown ends.”
 
The result was a high-energy clip, where the cast burst into the Palais de Tokyo – the fictitious location fashion aficionados will recall from the era’s great fashion rock video, George Michael’s 'Too Funky.'  Scores of photographers fighting for a good camera angle of the catwalk stars. Instead of Linda Evangelista or Nadja Auermann, Mattiussi sent out Fernando Cabral and Adut Akech, who takes a limo to the shoot to begin the video.
 
All very tailored, for men and women in this co-ed video, albeit with forgiving cuts, seen in striking electric blue wool redingotes and bold mannish jackets for the gals. Minimalist trucker blousons; sensational chucky wool sweaters with the house’s A Heart logo, and for the finale, a screen-goddess white gown in thousands of strings of bugle beads.
 
While the guys appeared in teal-colored green rock-producer suits; dude duffle coats; giant tropical orange parkas and mega houndstooth overcoats – très Ferré.
 
Gianfranco would have been pleased with the homage; a yearning for the naive energy of fashion when it suddenly became a global phenomenon in this Mattiussi’s youth.

"Mar 10, 2021","Browns has linked up with Designers’ Nest, the talent support platform for Nordic fashion graduates, and has chosen Swedish designer Emma Gudmundson to create a collection that will be sold exclusively in-store and online by the London-based boutique. She was personally selected by Ida Petersson, Browns’ Womenswear and Menswear Buying Director, who sits on the jury for the Designers’ Nest awards. 

Gudmundson is currently designing an exclusive capsule of handmade dresses in collaboration with the Browns buying team. They’ll debut this July.The deal goes beyond just stocking the product though and the designer will also “be supported with pre-payment as well as mentoring from all aspects of the Browns business from buying to brand engagement”.

The company said it joined the Designers’ Nest initiative “to offer graduates an opportunity to produce, showcase and sell their designs on an international scale”.

Petersson added that since joining the panel three years ago, she’s seen a wealth of talent “with this year proving to be the strongest line-up yet”. She described Gudmundson’s work as “sexy, visual and sustainable knitwear that doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen before. I was blown away with the intricacies of the construction and the one-off nature of each design”.

Her colourful “demi-couture"" dresses are made on a domestic knitting machine and are “draped and designed directly on the body, using hook-up stitches to give shape to the fabric”. They’re also zero-waste.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 10, 2021","VF Corporation announced on Tuesday the launch of a new corporate apprenticeship program for BIPOC students looking to build a career in the footwear industry.Dubbed 'DiverCity x Design', the program launches in partnership with the Pensole Academy in Portland, Oregon, who developed an immersive curriculum for students, and VF-owned brands Timberland, Vans, and The North Face. 

With a focus on providing students with the knowledge and experiences required to become well-rounded professional footwear designers, students will learn footwear design principles, product creation process, hands-on experience, professional development training and brand engagement. The program includes three phases starting with 27 students attending a three-week online pre-program that challenges their personal and professional skills. Next, the brands will select 18 of those students to enter the eight-week Pensole Masterclass. At this point, students will be divided into three teams to present one capstone project that will develop their footwear and retail industry knowledge.

At the final stage, five top performing students will be selected to participate in a year-long rotational apprenticeship across each of the brands’ headquarters including Timberland (Stratham, NH), Vans (Costa Mesa, Calif.) and The North Face (Denver).

“This partnership is not only a great opportunity for us to work closely with creative students and provide them insight into what it's like to work at Vans but we are especially proud to support Pensole's important mission of growing the representation of Black creatives in the footwear industry,” said Mark Haskins, vice president of global footwear product design, Vans. 

""DiverCity x Design is an amazing opportunity to reach consumers where they are and provide them a pathway into our industry unlike what they have been afforded before,” added Pensole founder D'Wayne Edwards. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 9, 2021","After the shock of multiple lockdowns and a 2020 marked indelibly by the Covid-19 pandemic, fashion designers are looking to the future with unexpected optimism. Judging from the collections presented this week at the virtual Paris fashion week, notably those by Lanvin and Giambattista Valli on Monday, next winter is likely to be as glittering and festive as the vibrantly crazy Roaring Twenties that followed World War One.
 Lanvin’s girls can’t wait to break loose and strut their stuff. Lockdowns and the pandemic’s gloom are a thing of the past, and they are treating themselves to an escapade in a Parisian palace. A stone’s throw from the Trocadéro, a stretch limo is disgorging girls at the Shangri-La hotel: let the party begin!
 
Plumes, crystals, glittering fabrics, oversize bows and train gowns: this is the vision Bruno Sialelli, creative director of the venerable Parisian maison, has for next winter, anticipating a return to joy and levity. In Lanvin’s video presentation, Sialelli’s jet-setting models delight in strolling down the hotel’s majestic staircases in skimpy, alluring outfits.Like shopaholics with scores of boxes in their arms, they try out innumerable looks in their rooms, scattered with luxury shoes and garments. Treading along the edge of a pool, inside their rooms or in the hotel’s lavishly panelled salons, they swing and bop jubilantly to the sound of ‘Rich Girl’ by Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve, who plays a cameo in the video.
 
Except for two monochrome suits, one in yellow and one in pink, and a tuxedo-and-corset outfit, trousers are banned from Lanvin’s fashion vocabulary this season. Dresses are ubiquitous, with a preference for rather short evening gowns, corset-style and leaving the shoulders bare. They are cut in glossy, glittering fabrics like duchess satin, taffeta, silk and crepe, all in pastel hues. Sialellli has even designed a few amusing total looks in fake leopard fur.
 Huge, gem-encrusted bows trail behind or fasten up the sides of asymmetric draped dresses. Ostrich feathers in powder pink and baby blue crop up everywhere, adding a light-hearted touch to several looks, whether on the collar of a sage green coat, as a shrug or mini cape, or even in a cloud-like skirt or draped around a top.

Elsewhere, lace, sequins and pearls adorn other, more sombre-hued outfits, while a series of sky blue dresses feature prints inspired by the work of US pop artist James Rosenquist.
 
The same yearning to be on the move again and to find new élan after a period of immobility and introspection characterises the Fall/Winter 2021-22 collection by Giambattista Valli, whose ladies navigate across various eras. Clad in short, ultra-chic outfits, they stride confidently on wedge-soled boots, their hair gathered under tiara-like headbands shimmering with pearls.
 
This season, Valli’s sexy, romantic style, with his feather-light fabrics, floral prints and transparent garments, veers towards a degree of classicism, marked by a predominantly black and white palette. It is apparent especially in the tweed suits with golden buttons and braids, in the white plastron featured on a short black dress or a longer sequinned one, or in the bows placed on collars, pockets, at the waist or on the shoulders.
 For this season, Valli has chosen as his muse Paolina Borghese Bonaparte, Napoleon’s pretty, intrepid sister, drawing also inspiration from Villa Borghese - the palace that was her Roman residence - and its huge park, now transformed into a museum.

References to Empire style are discreetly sprinkled here and there, in the dresses with a slightly elevated waist or in the crystal-trimmed necklines, or the floral prints and embroidery reminiscent of Villa Borghese’s frescoes and gardens.

In another nod to the past, some models’ forearms slip into half-sleeves billowing at the elbow with a puff of wrinkled taffeta, whose balloon shape can add a special period touch to any outfit.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 8, 2021","Maison Rabih Kayrouz has unveiled its latest project, MRK, at Paris Fashion Week. The Lebanese label, which has been showing at Paris Haute Couture Week for the last four years, exceptionally presented its latest collection as part of this season’s virtual ready-to-wear calendar, selecting the occasion to launch its new line, MRK.MRK’s Fall/Winter 2021-22 ready-to-wear collection is defined by rigorous design and well-crafted cuts. It consists of a selection of beautiful, timeless items, revisiting the classic women’s wardrobe staples in the sophisticated, minimalistic style beloved of Rabih Kayrouz.

In 2019, Kayrouz began to test this concept with a line called ‘Les Essentiels’, featuring a series of essential high-quality items to be revisited every season. ‘Les Essentiels’ will continue to exist in parallel with MRK.Kayrouz started from the same premise to create the latter, while giving the concept a fresh treatment. MRK’s looks will continue to evolve season after season, featuring new materials and proportions. The collection will be presented twice yearly, in January and July, and will be made available in three distinct drops, in line with current trends.
 
MRK is designed to offer a complete, easy-to-wear wardrobe combining comfort and simplicity, and including overcoats, jackets, blouses, trousers, skirts and dresses, both for day and evening wear.Kayrouz has worked in partnership with his label’s suppliers to be able to position MRK in a more affordable market segment, whose prices are 20% to 30% below those of Rabih Kayrouz’s usual range. Some of the items will be priced at around €300, well below the habitual price points.

Most of the fabrics will be drawn from Rabih Kayrouz’s archives, and Kayrouz himself will update some of the garments he painstakingly designed for previous collections, paying his customary care to the materials’ fineness and feel, as well as to detailing and finishings.

For next winter, he has concocted all-enveloping woollen overcoats, ample capes and trench coats in double gabardine, men’s-style jackets with pared-down lines, flowing poplin blouses and dresses with geometric patterns, monochrome velvet sets for everyday use, and knitwear and flannel items to be mixed and matched at will.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 8, 2021","A busy weekend of action at the virtual Paris Fashion Week, where most of the online videos were shot thousands of miles away from the French capital. Video shows recorded everywhere from Istanbul and Beirut to Manhattan. We caught up with five brands which powerfully expressed the desire for rebirth, and rejoicing, after this long night of lockdown.
 Altuzarra: Chrysalis and cashmere 
This season in Paris, or indeed anywhere, there have to be very few designers so successfully displaying their talent as Joseph Altuzarra, who unveiled a poetic collection on Saturday.
 
Shot with graceful camera movements inside what looked like a West Village apartment, the clothes all reflected the hyper cautious atmosphere of our times and the yearning for femininity in fashion. ""I was intuitively drawn to the story of a chrysalis turning into a butterfly. I stumbled on photos of butterfly wings and started collaging them to create a print. This became the starting point for the collection, and the inspiration for its overarching narrative,"" explained the designer.
 
Altuzarra has always been a subtle colorist, rarely more so than this weekend, where the initial inspiration led to blotchy tie-dye chiffon dresses in perfect hues of blood orange, power blue and faded turquoise.
 
Joseph added a new dimension for fall with classy knits in cashmere, merino or chenille. From the twinsets that included neat corsets to the blanket-style coats worn by a trio of models, some of them sporting spikey floral tiaras.
 
Plus, he cuts with tremendous dash – a skill notably seen in the funnel-neck coats and mannish redingotes that opened the video. Even more impressively, a windowpane check boyfriend suit that looked like the Great Gatsby had cut it down to size for Daisy Buchanan to wear.
 
Elegiac, elegant and excellent.
 
 Elie Saab: Regal fashion emerges from Beirut’s ruins 
Even in the midst of a global meltdown; living in crisis-ridden Lebanon; and designing in a fashion house located close to last year’s giant dockside explosion, Elie Saab has still managed to create a lush and glamorous collection for next season.
 
Since the pandemic began, Saab’s videos have extolled the topography and architecture of his native land. This was no exception. Shot inside a dramatic series of slate gray columns and pools, within the 2030 district of downtown Beirut undergoing major renovation, where the cast marched with vigor.
 
Elie began at night with a trio of great cocktails, cut in cascading layers of chiffon. These were worn with boots, making the models look like princesses and potentates. For daytime, this winter Saab suggests polka-dot business dresses and black and white paneled wool suits that echoed Carnaby Street at its zenith.
 
But the highlight of the show was the black faille gala dinner gowns cut with ruffles and worn by models sporting chignon hairstyles and diamond string earrings.
 
Everything made in black and white with tiny doses of emerald and dusty pink, and staged to a great techy dance track remix of Kylie Minogue’s classic, ""Can’t Get You Out of My Head.""
 
This was Saab doing what he does best – grand modern glamour, even in the midst of a global nightmare.
 Dice Kayek: Grand Guignol in the Pera Palace 
Got to hand it to Dice Kayek: this house knows how to shoot a stylish flick. Entitled ""Who Killed Philippe Stone,"" it was a mock murder mystery shot in the lobby of Istanbul’s most famous classic hotel, Pera Palace, where a cast of femme fatales danced melodramatically. And an Edith Piaf figure in a man’s tuxedo sang even more theatrically.
 
All attired in a very classy idea of what one wears to the better sort of cocktail party. Black silk cocoon dresses with one-foot long white collars; dainty little black dresses with silver floral appliqués; chiffon frocks with plenty of semi-transparent sleeves.
 
""I love you so much, and maybe now more than ever,"" croons the singer, as a roar bursts out and Monsieur Stone is found dead.
 
At first a bellhop points the finger at a rouged suspect with a pageboy haircut, who dances around a grand suite in a powder blue pleated suit, before accusing the whole cast, who appear in scratchy flashbacks, attired in Grand Guignol cloaks and with several donning Dice Kayek’s signature garment – their classy faux-virginal white shirts.
 
Then suddenly the female suspects all turn on the bellhop, who is exposed as having a wee bottle of poison and a dart, and pin the murder on the young man.
 
Perfectly styled by French veteran Franck Benhamou and acted with plenty of fervor, this was an ideal vehicle to display the latest fashion from Dice Kayek. Still, after 30 years, Turkey’s most influential runway brand.
 
 Zadig & Voltaire: Classier, and still coolNothing like a little self-love, especially in these dark times. And, why not in fashion? Particularly at Zadig & Voltaire, whose latest show is entitled ""Love Yourself.""
 
""I think after these last 12 months, being positive about yourself doesn’t hurt,"" opined the house’s creative director Cecilia Bönström at a pre-show coffee, before Sunday’s unveiling of her runway video.
 
Shot on a massive soundstage in Studio 217 in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris, and featuring grand backdrop vistas of great cities – from the Eiffel Tower and the Bank of England to Times Square and Stockholm's redbrick City Hall, where the Nobel banquet is held.
 
Zadig & Voltaire is a quintessentially cool Parisian label, though she is the type of French gal who has lived abroad. One with the chutzpah to wear soft cotton camouflage safari jackets with sculpted jogging pants; or crushed calfskin skirts, shirts and loon pants. Wearing her hair faintly bedraggled, the ideal image of the French lover so many men dream about. 
 
Crisp gold-dust-striped pantsuits, flouncy leopard-print cocktails worn with great new ZV logo tights, from a linkup with Fogal. And in a season of many ponchos, Bönström even had one of the best with Mexican stripes. Nothing terribly revolutionary but, nonetheless, extremely flattering fashion.
 
In a coed show, her guys donned soft striped mohair art student sweaters; rocker leather trousers or padded plaid parkas. The designer also had two big ideas this season, both of them smart. A natty, new mid-sized bag, ""Le Cecilia,"" made of vegetable dyed leather and featuring an adjustable chain, so it functions as a large clutch or a small shoulder bag.
 
Her other invention was referencing Voltaire, printing his pithy bons mots across khaki military tunics and putting his portrait on gray T-Shirts. The philosopher, who loved juxtapositions, would have approved.
 Givenchy: The latest evolution of an everchanging houseOne house that has been through a lot of definitions about who it really is, has to be Givenchy.
 
Since it’s founder, Hubert de Givenchy, retired in 1995, the house has been through a half-dozen designers, including such heavy hitters as John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Riccardo Tisci. So the definition of what Givenchy stands for – apart from its graphic G script logo – has gotten pretty blurred. 
 
For decades, Givenchy’s most famous look was the Bettina blouse, a pristine, enveloping white cotton shirt. Tisci took it to tougher terrain, which is where its latest designer Matthew M. Williams clearly feels comfortable. An early look in his video show on Sunday was of a model wearing pants and a see-through bra. Not quite Bettina.
 
Moreover, where Hubert dressed Holly Golightly to drink highballs on the Upper East Side, Williams attires his cast for all-night rave parties in Berlin. With lots of posh S&M leather clubbing blousons, rude boy puffers, faux fur parkas and Klondike trapper Canadian coats. 
 
In a coed show, most of the cast wore thick wool balaclavas and furry gloves – all marching under arc lights on a wet PVC runway. A color palette of black, anthracite, muddy brown and darkest purple, and why not?
 
This collection was about 1,000 miles away, and 50 years distant, from Hubert’s childhood as a pampered provincial Protestant minor league aristocrat, but it somehow had the same sense of ambition. Though Williams comes from an entirely different background and espouses a very different aesthetic, this collection somehow felt right. It should not have, but it did.
 
All Williams needs now is another Truman Capote to pen a novel worthy of a feature film, where this alluring cast can appear.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 5, 2021","The curtain fell Monday on another Milan fashion week -- or at least the screen went dark on this season's all-digital affair, in which designers looked ahead to better times.The autumn/winter 2021-2022 collections had an air of hope for when coronavirus is banished or at least brought under control: for when home clothes are shed and new outfits see the light of day, for when life simply returns to a semblance of normal.Sequins, glitter and frillsSequins set the tone for an irresistably festive mood, with the standard set by Prada.

Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada used them for a sparkling lining of a large faux fur stole.

Elsewhere they were more full-on, entirely covering an otherwise straight-cut coat, or on skirts, bags and shoes.

At Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli used sequins on a skin-coloured dress, or a shimmering floor-length cape.

They were inserted into knitwear at Missoni or Brunello Cucinelli, while at Armani, sequins invaded a black tuxedo jacket, the effect completed with ruffles and gemstones.Inside outsideAfter months cooped up indoors, intimate wear was given an outing: dresses with thin straps in silk, lace or voile were on the catwalks of all the major houses.

At Fendi, there were fluid silk dresses, extended to the neck with the incorporation of long scarves.

New artistic director Kim Jones also used silk for trousers and tops, as if the working girl had transformed her silk pyjamas into an ultra-chic urban outfit.

Valentino's nets and laces revealed more than they hid, and MM6 Maison Margiela had camisoles with thin straps in a collection where everything was backwards, where underneath was on top.Bomber jacketsBomber jackets brought a hint of G.I. Jane to the collections, although more in the vein of Marilyn Monroe visiting the Marines than Demi Moore's shaved head.

At Prada, the nylon jackets were oversized and black. At Etro, they had an ethnic feel, at Pucci they were branded, while at Max Mara they highlighted the label's founding date of 1951.

For Alberta Ferretti they were in leather, while Dolce & Gabbana made them sexy with Madonna-style conical additions to the chest.BlackBlack was used to claim a more formal wardrobe.

At Valentino, the colour dominated with only flashes of white, gold and check.

At Prada, it contrasted with elements of colour on the arms, legs, necks or in accessories.

Armani used it to similar effect, the collection based on black with blue, green and lilac. A grand finale of black at Fendi brought hyper-sophisticated looks.

Meanwhile the strong woman with a contemporary Amazonian spirit at Alberta Ferretti wore black overalls, capes and wide black trousers.FurLike an animal coming out of hibernation, the heavy coat of the Yeti or Star Wars' Chewbacca is back, whether real or fake.

For Prada, the fur was synthetic and ubiquitous, used not just for coats and stoles but also in the decor of the show, covering walls and floors.

Fur specialists Fendi presented several grand looks, but with a novel approach -- re-using materials from previous pieces.

Florentine house Ferragamo was fur-free, but showed knitwear with dramatic fur-like fringes.

At Dolce & Gabbana, the fur coat was colourful, sometimes pink, golden or multicoloured, and always oversized.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Mar 5, 2021","Finally, Paris Fashion Week had an actual live catwalk show. A drive-in runway event witnessed Thursday night by a few score of editors and influencers from inside Citroen DS7s and staged inside the AccorArena.
 
It’s a hybrid car and this was a hybrid show, with 70 guests and iced half bottles of Ruinart; two per chauffeured driven car. The Citroen headlights illuminating the runway models inside the stadium, normally reserved for rock gods like Madonna, U2 and Beyoncé. 
Car radios all tuned to the same frequency, techno trance driving on the cast, guests straining out of the sun roofs to capture the action live on Instagram.
 
An homage to Paris at night; a slinking and sexy fall/winter 2021 that trumpeted all that is good about the Coperni duo of Arnaud Vaillant and Sébastien Meyer. Their ability to redefine classics with the unexpected cuts, angles and materials.Cut-out hacking jackets worn over slouching leather pants; pagoda shoulder blazers shown with cuffed mannish pants or one shoulder silk tops, trimmed with zips.  
Above all the sizzling cocktails with mini-skyscraper shoulders worn over gray leather thigh boots; their giant décolleté faux-fur gown and a dazzling white faux-fur coat cinched at the waist by a curvy C Coperni logo buckle belt. A Studio 54, Andy Warhol superstar look if ever there was one.
 
Silver eye-shadow, spacey sci-fi shades; intergalactic warrior-woman hair styles.
  
The west may well still be deep in the pandemic, but as soon as the never ending curfews ends and lockdown lifts, this is the collection that smart party animals will want to devour.
 
Even deep in the bowls of a giant arena, with all the roof and ceiling lights turned off, the City of Light, and fashion, suddenly felt a little brighter.
 
Bravo Coperni.

With its collection for Fall/Winter 2021-22, presented as part of Paris' virtual fashion week, the renowned brand started a new chapter, unveiling a fresh and youthful wardrobe that tapped into the current fashion zeitgeist without renouncing the label's origins. Graphical effects, ultra-short silhouettes, geometric lines, colour blocking, vinyl and leather all jostled for attention, and among it all, one could see the Courrèges DNA that brusquely propelled fashion into the future more than half a century ago. Presenting little easy-to-wear pieces that were never boring and demonstrated a real attention to detail, the house's new creative director reimagined its codes with a contemporary twist, all while tapping into the heritage of André and Coqueline Courrèges, particularly the couple's creative early years. 

The runway in itself was a manifesto to this new era, with the models walking in a giant, immaculately white open-air cube, observed only by a camera placed at the centre of the structure. At the end of the show, the space, La Station – Gare des Mines, in the Parisian suburb of Aubervilliers, was besieged by a handful of youths, who clambered over its smooth, white walls to join the party. Walking the perimeter of this futuristic setting with carefree ease, this season's Courrèges girl looked to have leapt straight out of the 1960s and into the world of today, which she took to with natural confidence. Combining caps, zip-up jumpers and thigh-length seven-league boots with ultra-short outfits and big black glasses, she made for a particularly seductive sight. 

The famous A-line minidress with large pockets was interpreted as a number of different pieces, mixing a stretch jersey top with a wool crepe bottom, in some looks. These were essentially offered in black or white, but also in pale pink and bright red. The wardrobe included other Courrèges classics too, from A-line miniskirts to short coats, via pieces in leather or vinyl and little jackets with rivets, which sometimes featured large fur collars.  
Circles and checks appeared on the tops of certain jumpsuits and dresses in wool crepe. The geometric circular motif also popped up in low-cut dresses, and in leather pants and tops with cut-outs. Other looks worthy of note included 70s-style tunic and pant combos, as well as loose coats featuring a large check inspired by a pattern from 1963. And don't forget the vintage touch added by large square suitcases (without wheels!), which were branded with the house's logo and carried by hand by the models. 

Since being sold by its founders in 2011, this is the third relaunch attempt undertaken by the fashion house, owned as of 2017 by Artémis, the Pinault family's investment firm. Suffice to say then, this latest endeavour promises to be an interesting challenge for Belgian-born Di Felice, who previously worked with Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga and Louis Vuitton, and Raf Simons at Christian Dior, before joining Courrèges.

"Mar 3, 2021","From models strutting inside an empty museum to designers absenting themselves from the catwalk calendar, this season’s virtual fashion weeks have been re-styled with a new look many expect will endure when traditional runway shows resume.COVID-19 restrictions forced New York, London, Milan and Paris fashion weeks to go virtual in the past year, with brands rethinking how to keep the buzz of catwalk shows online.

While many are optimistic of a return to the events usually attended by buyers, editors and celebrities, digital presentations - which have opened up fashion week to a wider audience - are likely to stay on.“Digital first is absolutely something that we will continue to see,” British Fashion Council Chief Executive Caroline Rush told Reuters.

While streaming shows is nothing new, the pandemic has accelerated a shift in an industry that in recent years turned to social media to target younger spenders.
Some labels, including Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger, sat out fashion week this season. Versace is presenting its collection after its usual showcase, Milan Fashion Week, ends.

“We will see physical runway shows from these very large brands who can afford to put on multimillion dollar entertainment events. But they may not be during the traditional fashion week and they may have audiences that are primarily made up of customers,” Lauren Sherman, chief correspondent for The Business of Fashion, said.

“There’s been a real shift in the balance of power that was already happening ... But now there’s proof of concept that if you want to ignore fashion week, it’s probably not going to hurt your bottom line.”

Foregoing the usual expensive catwalk events, most brands streamed pre-recorded videos on a fashion week platform.

On show this season were plenty of bright colours to lift moods in an industry that saw stores, factories and studios shut in the pandemic.

“A large part of fashion week outside of the shows was the community getting... together and feed(ing) off of that creativity and so, with that lacking, it’s not the same,” designer Rebecca Minkoff, one of the few to hold a live presentation in New York, said.

“But for those who are able to be creative and innovative, now is the time to figure out how you pivot and for those that do, I think there is great opportunity.”© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Mar 3, 2021","French designer Marine Serre, whose commitment to sustainable fashion is increasingly her hallmark, plunged her audience into the heart of her design and production process on the second day of Paris Fashion Week. Serre has jettisoned her post-apocalyptic mood and a traditional video presentation format, allowing the public to become directly involved with her label thanks to a website where multiple windows show how Serre works, and the different facets of ‘Core’, her Fall/Winter 2021-22 collection.Rather than a minutes-long video, the site is a complete digital experience viewers are able to enjoy at their own leisure on their devices. “Do people understand regenerated garments? Does anyone imagine the work that goes into them?” Serre asked herself. This year, the designer has overhauled her entire methodology, “working on practicality, comfort, volumes and pricing,” in order to cut costs and make her collection more accessible.
 
The collection summarises the codes and fundamental identity of Serre’s label, launched in 2016, doing so through 50 looks worn in their daily lives by Serre’s tribe and her muses, among them Belgian artist-model Kristina De Coninck, and featured in seven short films shot in different settings.The collection consists of 12 chapters and materials, each with its own explanatory film, taking viewers on a long journey through factories, warehouses and ateliers, and following the thread of fabric and garment manufacturing in Europe, from eastern European countries to Portugal, France and Italy.

Serre fashions her creations out of an inexhaustible supply of used clothes, from mountains of head scarves to giant bales of jeans, cartfuls of sweaters, trolleys filled with t-shirts, sacks overflowing with bedspreads. Once painstakingly sorted by type and colour, the garments are disassembled and stitched back together to create new models looking like clever patchwork or complex puzzles.

The silk scarves Serre has been hoarding forever “end up as dresses, both loose and graceful.” Leather that “is no longer used but lasts for ages” is cut in swathes and reassembled under the viewers’ eyes to make jackets, trousers and dresses. The same goes for old tartan scarves and throws “saved from oblivion,” regenerated and mixed with jersey fabric to acquire a new lease of life as long-sleeved tops and hybrid kilts.The collection’s denim items are made exclusively using old jeans, with cotton the only other material allowed. Once re-dyed and re-treated, they come back to life as new. Serre has also scouted local markets for fluffy or quilted bedspreads, even tasselled ones, whose oversize, slightly kitsch flowery patterns find new purpose in maxi skirts and zipped tops.
 
The designer has a fascination for the humble t-shirt, a garment that, with its prints, logos and sundry designs often bears witness to special occasions. T-shirts are first arranged by colour, then minutely inspected by Serre, who picks and cuts out the most inspirational designs to repurpose them her own way. “Needing careful, consistent placing, and the deliberate inlaying of printed patterns,” a multiplicity of images and cotton fabric cuts blend together into draped dresses.

Knitwear too is susceptible to “all kinds of experiments, with interlaced threads, juxtaposed stitching and a geography of patterns spawning unique fusions and imaginative associations,” producing original knitted dresses and novel sweaters.

Period home linen, perhaps lying forgotten in an attic, yields more unexpected treasures. Crocheted tablecloths, curtains, tea-towels, doilies, bed sheets, pillow cases in linen or white cotton, often lace-trimmed and sometimes dotted with floral motifs, not to mention nightgowns: everything can be regenerated. A length of lace can be cut here, an embroidered patch there, tassels elsewhere. Details that are then stitched on to collars, sleeves or other specific garment areas, creating amazing frilled dresses mixing sheer and opaque fabrics.Carpets from all over the world, as well as napkins and brocaded or jacquard tablecloths, their ends sometimes frayed, are “genuine garment material, concealing neither their grain nor their artisanal provenance,” and are ideal for tailoring a doublet or revamping a pair of trousers or a dress. Carpets are regenerated first, boiled at length in a dark dye cauldron.

Half of Serre's collection is made using upcycled garments, while the rest is produced with fabrics made from recycled yarn. For the suits and tailored items, the designer commissioned dark wool and cotton fabrics with a lozenge pattern, turning her signature moon motif into a geometric icon. She has also fashioned sport jackets, trousers and miniskirts in black or lilac moire, “my very own nylon,” as she calls it. From early on, moire has been one of Serre’s favourite fabrics, highly appreciated for “its plaited threads creating a psychedelic effect, so special to the touch and with such an easy shine.”

Serre’s “eco-futuristic” wardrobe is completed by a multi-pocket beige twill utility jacket, full of quirky detailing with its zips, assorted pockets of the patch, over-stitched, flap and bellows variety, with strips and pouches for holding pen, flask, wallet, phone and notebook, not to mention a key chain and a mini pocket housing hydro-alcoholic hand sanitizer.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 2, 2021","One has to hand it to Christelle Kocher, one of the hardest working designers in Paris, and a classically minded creator who manages to create edgy and contemporary clothes that look absolutely right for, well, right now. 
Entitled Bird of Paradise, in a riff on the ancient Greek mythological phoenix rising from the ashes in its cyclical renewal, her latest collection for her brand Koché cannily mixed sportswear and French glamour with admirable élan.
 
“I think the desire for renewal now is very powerful and I wanted to express that in this collection. People rising above adversity,” explained Kocher over coffee in her 20th arrondissement studio, located in a quiet lane in north Paris.The collection marked her second since signing a long-term license with Only The Brave, the key holding company of Renzo Rossi of Diesel fame. That was clear from the quality of these clothes – from the laser-cut-out cocktails in a modern devoré to the cool perforated leather shirts and jackets, finished on the inside with athletic tape.
 
Kocher has always been clever about incorporating street and sport into more sophisticated fashion. This season, she whipped up a series of cut-out dance tops and sliced up sweatshirts, some finished with cock feathers; mixed in with Photoshop zebra-print party dresses. Kocher, who in previous seasons referenced Paris Saint-Germain in multiple high-fashion soccer looks, this time even made a great leather blouson in the stitched pattern of a classic football. 
The designer incorporated the phoenix in several dashing turquoise and violet prints seen in matelassé jackets and jeans. Kocher also tapped into Rossi’s roots as the man who more or less invented high-price distressed denim, with some great burgundy-hued denim pants and tops made with a remarkable velour hand.
 
“Renzo has been great to work with. He really respects designers. And his group has some very talented creators, from John Galliano to Viktor & Rolf, to mention just two. It’s been a great experience working with him in Italy. The quality is great, and it allows us to fully concentrate on creation,” explains Kocher, who met Rossi after winning the prestigious ANDAM award, on whose board the Italian sits. 
All shot with tremendous gusto in Kocher’s video, deep inside the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, the famed North Paris avant-garde theatre, seen in the opening scene of Jean-Jacques Beineix’s 1981 film Diva.
 
“It is still as wrecked and distressed as ever,” smiles Kocher, whose cast all dashed about the delightfully bashed up old theatre. Her seductive French ladies in off-the-shoulder cocktails cut with manifest aplomb.
 
Several small one-foot-high mannequins inside Kocher’s studio bearing early prototypes of these cocktails further attesting to her skill as a draper.
 
In a word, Bird of Paradise is the latest instalment from a classically trained designer with her fingers on an edgier pulse.

"Mar 2, 2021","One designer who has enjoyed an unusual career path is Andreas Aresti, a Queens-born designer, who lives in the West Village, produces in Italy and showed his latest collection of his brand Lourdes in Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday. 
The son of a Peruvian mother and Greek father, Aresti claims he almost stumbled into fashion, nabbing a job when just 16 with Nicola Formichetti.
 
“I’m Queens born and raised, parents from Greece and Peru. It’s actually very common in Queens, to be a mix of Hispanic and Middle Eastern. I never wanted to be a designer. I wanted to sew clothing for myself. But when I was 16 my first job was working with Nicola and I realized that I could be lots of things from a stylist to art director,” said Aresti in a Zoom from Milan.A highly self-confident New Yorker, Aresti progressed to working with the likes of Kanye West, Stefano Pilati and Giorgio Armani, starting to do shoots with the Italian master in 2014, when he was developing his art space projects and had brought back his eyewear license from Luxottica, ending up creating e-commerce and content for Armani Jeans and Privé.
 
“He gave me my first job,” recalls Aresti, 27, who launched his brand Lourdes just as the pandemic struck in early in 2020 in Paris.
 
On Tuesday, Lourdes, named after Aresti's mum, released an ambient video show video shot inside a Milanese apartment. Just a couple, looking forlorn initially, before connecting and dancing dreamily over parquet floors and spotless bed. The designer named the clip 'Ascension,' for “entering a period of optimism after this lockdown. The clothes kind of drape upwards and people can relate. It’s about kids dancing alone in houses, which is what we have all been doing.” 
His duo both wearing lots of great clobber – from lean cotton pants with fins and blades to blue jeans with multiple pockets that extended up from the ankle. Topped with great angular versions of surgeon’s smocks, and techy fiber tops finished with painterly daubs.
 
Lourdes is produced in Vincenzo, Italy and is currently stocked in over 20 sales points, including Farfetch and Essence, a perfectly respectable result given it was launched in lockdown.
 
Where does he hope to be in five years? 
 
“I want this to be more a platform than a brand, maybe I will make an album next, not a collection. The way things are going the creative industries will completely merge – fashion, movies, music - and in future will just be one. I don’t think we should embrace singularity,” said the Lourdes designer, attired in a Cat trucker hat.
 Which came across in his best look - a fab puffer with a long diagonal zip from hip to opposing shoulder in a look anchored by a pair of hyper pointy winklepickers – which was street and chic.
 
“Given my prior training, I can be a lot of things. There is something of any of my old bosses included in me,” said Aresti, who never attended any fashion college.
 
Come to think of it, neither did Armani.

"Mar 1, 2021","Paris Fashion Week has never been the easiest of cities for young hopeful students, though that lacuna underwent a major shift on Monday, when the Master's students of the Institut Français de la Mode (IFM) opened this month’s runway season. 
Even allowing for the fact that this is overwhelmingly a digital season, this represents a sea of change in Paris, where the scene has always been dominated by giant luxury brands or must-see avant-garde independents. By contrast, shows in London by either Central Saint Martins graduates or the fresh-out-of-college talent in Fashion East are often given key time slots on the calendar.
 
Granting IFM’s Master's students the opening hour of the hard-to-even-dream-about-entering official schedule of the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode was a major sign by the French establishment of its ambition to turn IFM into a top-five international fashion college.The college is unique internationally in that it offers three different areas of study including creative fashion; craftmanship or savoir faire and luxury management.
 
The Master's video, unveiled Monday afternoon at 5.30 a.m. CET, came from a class that accepts 70 students per year, 20% from France, the rest from all over the world. Judging from the 10-minute video, IFM is off to a strong start, with several graduates blessed with bundles of talent.
 
Take James Giltner from Colorado, whose concept was a short-lived Printemps department store that opened almost four decades ago in Denver.“It didn’t work out, closed and became a medical centre. So I imagined going up escalators in this chic space to give blood, past the memories of all this great forward fashion from Paris from the '80s,” explained Giltner, in a private presentation by a dozen students before the screening. The result – a series of excellent phantasmagorical knitted creations; woven around electrical cables to create intergalactic goddess looks.
 
While Johanna Imbach from France went for a more scientific approach, while still using knit. Combining classical cotton and woollen yarns with high-tech threads to develop brilliantly sculpted creations. Dresses and jumpsuits with memories that moulded into chequered high-tech, Renaissance-royalty ideas, all suitable for major league rock stars.
 
Or Mudassir Mohammed, whose family hailed from Hyderabad, who fused the memories of the end of colonialism in India into several great looks – from double-layer Madras check blue tunics to super revamps of traditional men’s coats.
 
IFM Master's graduates also had plenty of oomph when it came to accessories. Such as Agathe Pornin, a French lady who dreamed up a series of pumps, boots and high-heels – all wrapped in leather or even denim, so they seemed almost organically grown. Or Luca Tessarin, an Italian who was inspired by a lockdown spent in rural Lombardy to develop malleable leather bags, echoing design ideas from the studio of Gio Ponti. 
All of the accessories developed inside IFM’s own atelier, which uses state-of-the-art machinery to train the students – all the way to 3D printers. The latter employed in a great shoe collection by Xavier Chane Li Sek, who made a series of natty elasticated boots with gutsy mini-tractor-tire soles – mimicking mushrooms from his youth in South East Asia - from the 3D printer. And wowed with a pair of fantasy heels finished with burnished leathers that looked almost alive.
 
The Master's students were the first graduates from the newly created campus of IFM, a large green building located along the Seine beside the Gare de Austerlitz in the 13th arrondissement. IFM is an amalgamation of a fashion business school pioneered by Pierre Bergé back in 1986, and the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale, arguably the world’s leading school for pattern cutters. IFM opened along the Seine at a sprawling green structure on the banks of the Seine often referred to as Les Docks, and now has almost 800 students.
 
After a €20 million refit by the building’s owner, the Caisse de Depots, and a €10 million investment by major Paris houses – such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Hermès and Yves Saint Laurent – the school seems poised to really compete with the most sought-after fashion colleges – FIT in New York, CSM in London, the Academy in Antwerp, La Cambre in Brussels and Marangoni in Milan.“We are a non-profit organization and we have only one goal. Guide and produce the best possible graduates for the fashion and luxury industry. And it helps we have the support of all these great Paris houses. Where else in the world can you get experts on this level to lecture to your students?” notes Xavier Romatet, the dean of the college.
 
Thanks to the cash injection from these global brands, IFM now has an impressive 8,000 square-meter campus, airy classrooms and advanced professional machinery in a fab lab. French industry leaders have also worked hard to encourage geographical and social inclusiveness. Almost 100 students now are apprentices in Paris-based brands; while internationally over 40 countries now have students studying at IFM.

"Feb 28, 2021","Call it a Tale of Three, not Two, Cities. It speaks volumes about how much the pandemic has turned the international fashion calendar upside down, that serious editors had to open Sunday watching an MM6 show video in Milan, before tuning into New York, which woke up to Tom Ford’s latest ideas, and finishing the evening in Paris, where Sonia Rykiel unveiled its first collection since becoming insolvent in 2019.
 
No day has summed up quite so well just how scrambled the runway seasons have been, with shows and cities overlapping at will, without, however, dampening the creativity of designers, as these these Fall/Winter 2021 collections revealed.
 MM6 Maison MargielaCapturing the mood of the times, MM6, the more youthful line of Masion Margiela, staged a show in reverse mode, beginning with a model in a ripped-up Aran sweater brandishing a sign reading ""Fin,"" or end.
 
Lingerie tops cut upside down, tunics sewn inside out, Harris tweed-style top coats cut into hoodies, techy pink blouses morphed like musketeer’s capes, and stupendous Perfectos with red silk matelassé sleeves. Not only has Covid scrambled our lives, its has also mashed up the division between garments.While the MM6 collections are designed by an anonymous collective, all looks boasted the asymmetrical influence of John Galliano, a Gibraltar-born Briton creating for Margiela, a Parisian house founded by a Belgian conceptualist that is now owned by Italian fashion billionaire Renzo Rosso.
 
All displayed on a cast marching around a dingy cabaret, as a pianist on a white piano played spacey jazz and an unseen audience applauded each passage. As well they should, for this was top notch de-constructivism for our times.
 Emilio PucciEmilio Pucci is an Italian brand founded by a Florentine nobleman, which is controlled by the giant French conglomerate LVMH. In recent seasons it has practiced the savvy strategy of collaborating with happening young independent designers to create its runway collections – most recently, Christelle Kocher from Paris.
 
This season, with the lockdown rendering that policy moot, Pucci called on an in-house team, which concentrated on the traditional mission of the house: dressing the very well heeled in expensive resorts.
 
High-color quilted bomber jackets, bodysuits suggesting the models wearing them were two-meters tall, and neatly cut pleated dresses. All in swirling and opulent acidic prints from the house’s famed archive – bearing names that suggested high living, such as Cervinia or Cortina d’Ampezzo.
 
All rather pretty, but somehow not remotely relevant. A collection that looked as if nothing had changed in the past 15 months. Fashion caught in a time warp, and all the less interesting for that.
 Tom FordTom Ford is an American designer designing for an American fashion house, which he also controls. 
 
As reported, Ford was forced to push back the presentation of his collection from its originally scheduled date of Wednesday, February 17, apparently due to Covid preventing him from having a fully staffed atelier.
 
Designers have generally taken one of two tracks this season, either focusing on comfortable luxury and practical clothes, or betting that the lockdown will end this fall and that women will be dying to go out and look glamorous. Ford is 100% a supporter of the second camp. His models look thoroughly sexy, and very much on the market for a new lover.
 
Vamping in acid-dyed jeans and barely-there georgette and lace tops, showing meters of leg in leather hot pants or elastic cashmere logo mini skirts held on by chain belts strutting their stuff in micro-mesh cocktails worn under enveloping white plongé leather puffers. Best of all, the six-button blazer-cocktails, or the rusty-hued crushed velvet jackets worn with nothing underneath. 
""Fierce, powerful and badass are words that resonate with me this season. I mean, who doesn’t want to be badass. Especially after being trapped at home for a year,"" explained Ford in his program notes.
 
Whether the Tom Ford guy will show up to dates with all this hot totty is slightly debatable, seeing as one third of Ford’s men's collection was focused on dressing gowns. Albeit superb leopard-print or blue sapphire psychedelic robes, worn with tie-dyed pajamas.
 
However, when the guys did get dressed up it was with enormous panache. Two of his models even wore the same chocolate zebra-print blazers and rusty velvet tuxes as Tom’s gals. 
 
Ford may not be a revolutionary designer, and his stylistic references are rather retro, but the fact is, if one really wants to look sharp this fall and make a really good entrance, then one could do an awful lot worse than shopping at Tom Ford. For guys and girls.
 Sonia RykielSunday evening also marked the return of Sonia Rykiel, the first display since the house went into receivership in 2019.
 
Turned out it was little more that a teaser on social media, but what there was, was actually very good. Rykiel, who passed away in 2018, was know as the Queen of the Knits, and this mini virtual show seen on social media was almost entirely made up of knitwear.
 
Historically, Sonia was also famous for being the first designer to place text on knitwear, something this collection did with considerable skill. Running the name in sporting graphic down sleeves, placing it in rainbow colors on top of multiple stripes, and playing with great iconic sketches of Paris landmarks.
 
All worn by a youthful and diverse cast in a collection entitled ""Follow the Stripes,"" and generally expressing the contemporary longing for optimism. Once again, designed by an in-house team, but one that seems to understand the current zeitgeist.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 27, 2021","A study in contrasts on Saturday morning at Milan Fashion Week, as two key fashion marques played against their reputations. Giorgio Armani showing evening ideas but as daywear, Sportmax revolutionizing its DNA.
 Giorgio ArmaniTwo shows in one at Giorgio Armani: couples – women and men – marching in multiple passages, in a show that began unusually with evening wear.
 
Girls in a great array of iridescent tops, soap bubble effects and ruffled floral shapes. Guys in band collar Chinese shirts under viscose velvet jackets.Light dancing off half the collection, presented in a video shot inside Armani’s Milan headquarters. Fluid tailoring throughout – the ladies in mixes of crepe dhotis and silk jodhpurs, worn over soft-shouldered blazers or several great smock-like tunics. Giorgio’s reputation as fashion’s best tailor this past half-century is not under threat after this imaginative performance. 
 
And talk about a great color palette – aquatic hues, greens with turquoise reflections, pale purples and soft pinks – unexpected in a Fall/Winter 2021 collection.
 
At times, some of the parachute fabrics looked as if the designer was trying too hard. But better that than playing safe.
 
For cerebral soirées the sparkling coal-dust-like tuxedos and black velvet coat dresses with wing collars reeked of class, leavened with a touch of humor – a black and white portrait of a youthful Giorgio printed on a cocktail dress. 
""The collection unfolds with a nocturnal ambience, but also in the middle of the day… a structured wardrobe, a collection of garments that, when updated, span the decades in rapid transitions,"" explained the designer in his program notes.
 
At the opening, a glowering green gorilla statue looked down over the score of leggy models as they marched into the show. And the finale, the heavy weight champ of Italian designers, Armani, posed beaming, before leaning on his eco King Kong.
 SportmaxA new, naughtier nighttime gal at Sportmax. 

What was previously the well-behaved cousin of the more mature Max Mara, is now her devil-may-care younger sister. A femme fatale likely to turn the head of big sister’s beaux.
 
The set said it all: multiple chandeliers – several lying on the ground – in a dark night club space where the cast slinked around on the prowl.
 
Long Lycra skirts with rocker leather shirts or blousons, racy bra tops and semi-sheer looks, as the kid sister set off determined to have some fun post lockdown. Beatle mop top or waxy hairdos, mini cross earrings, big seductress shades.
 
Later, femme fatales at a gallery opening in sleek gloves; leather dresses finished with electric cable necklaces; faux-cheongsam coats or saucy tie-dye one-shoulder gallerina looks worn with bovver boots. 
All marking a significant change of gears for the label. Even the skinny cardigans looked suggestive, finished with hook-and-eye lingerie detailing. Though there was plenty in the collection for more serious moments – gray metal suits cut with chauffeur’s jackets and drainpipe pants, or perfectly draped mannish top coats.
 
Great to see Sportmax make such an impact in a show that ended with the cast dancing in a trance under the crystal chandeliers. Predicting that when the long nightmare of the pandemic ends, women will be yearning to enjoy and control their lives fully.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 27, 2021","Pandemic or not, Paris Fashion Week, which starts a 10-day season on Monday, March 1, can boast a schedule with 92 women’s ready-to-wear brands, almost a dozen newcomers and several important debuts, all of which testifies to the continued importance of the French capital as a magnet for designers. 
And even if the fashion week is a virtual one, essentially online, it still features mega brands like Christian Dior, Hermès, Chanel and Louis Vuitton, which will unveil the final collection of the season on the afternoon of Wednesday, March 10. Currently, no public is allowed at any show in France, but the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode expects about 10 houses to stage closed-door live videos of their collections with models. 
 
Since the pandemic began, the Fédération has radically updated its website, which covers the live runway shows on its calendar. This season it will debut a new exclusive worldwide partnership with Tik Tok, inviting users to create special looks for Paris Fashion Week and share them via a dedicated hashtag.The Fédération will also add designer lookbooks to its platform, something that was not the case before, and link up with the V&A in London. The museum will provide videos and articles from its Fashion in Motion program for the Insider magazine section of the Fédération’s platform.
 
Underlining the increasingly fragmented nature of runway seasons in the big four fashion capitals – staged chronologically in New York, London, Milan and Paris – many brands are showing days or weeks after their official season ends. 
 
Remarkably, the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), designer Tom Ford unveils his own latest collection on the day before Paris opens, or 10 days after his original scheduled slot in the New York season. 
 
While here in Paris, Sonia Rykiel will debut a new studio-designed collection off calendar, on the night of Sunday, February 28, as the brand emerges from bankruptcy. Dior, under the creative direction of fashion’s most noted feminist designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, has moved its show back until March 8 to coincide with International Women’s Day. And, in another surprise move, Vuitton has suddenly decided to postpone its own show by one day.
 
Asked about the Vuitton decision, Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, quipped: ""We have extended the fashion week by one day!""
 
""I think we all realize that we have got to be flexible and inclusive,"" added the Fédération’s executive president Pascal Morand in a joint phone call.
 
""Houses are not changing dates to be difficult. I understand in Tom Ford’s case, he discovered that, due to Covid, there was no one in his atelier. I think we need to take all these changes calmly,"" commented Toledano.
 
The duo stated that 92 houses, including Fédération members and guests, means 10 more than in the most recent week in September, and more or less the same as in March 2020. 
 
In a novel move, the Paris season officially kicks off with a joint masters graduate show from the Institut Français de la Mode (IFM), a major statement by the French establishment that it is determined to build a fashion college to rival those in London, New York or Antwerp.
 
""It’s our dream to have the most successful and best fashion school here in Paris. You might recall it was my first goal when I became president. Then Pascal took the initiative, and we have come a long way. Xavier (Romatet, IFM Dean) is doing a fantastic job and this is the first step of our dream becoming a reality,"" stressed Toledano.
 
However, many highly regarded houses, like Comme des Garçons and Junya Watanabe of Japan and three houses within the Kering luxury group – Balenciaga, Saint Laurent and McQueen – are not showing, denuding Paris of some major impact.
 
""I tend to believe that each house in Kering has its own reasons. I don’t get the impression it is a corporate decision by Kering. It’s a difficult period for everyone and one has to respect that. And, don’t forget, Balenciaga is coming back to couture this summer,"" noted Toledano.

The Fédération is also contributing financially to supporting young designers via its Paris showroom, Sphere. On top of this, they are backing show video productions, partly funded by DEFI, a French fashion industry fund. And L’Oréal is lending a helping hand too, supplying hair and makeup for certain independent designers free of charge. Made available to locals and international designers alike, young hopefuls like Benjamin Benmoyal, Kenneth Ize and South Africa’s Thebe Magugu have all benefitted from these support initiatives. 
The two Fédération executives acknowledged that no final decision has been taken on whether Paris will stage live runway shows this summer – late June for menswear and early July for couture. 
 
""It will depend on the sanitary conditions this summer. And we will respect whatever decision the government approves. But, let’s be clear, all of the houses are dying to come back to physical shows. Lots of designers are very frustrated,"" insisted Morand.
 
Paris also clearly keeps attracting younger designers, with 11 newcomers on the calendar this March, including Benjamin Benmoyal, Weinsanto, Cecilie Bahnsen, Rokh and Wataru Tominaga. Plus, the season boasts two major first appearances by new designers at Chloé and Courrèges – Gabriela Hearst and Nicolas Di Felice, respectively.
 
""For me it is very simple. When you are young and dream of fashion, Paris comes to mind. It’s still the magnate. When you are an ambitious young designer you want to compete with the best. Like for a professional soccer player. They want to play with the best Lewandowski, Messi and Salah. Same thing in fashion, in Paris,"" laughed Toledano.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 27, 2021","Louis Vuitton has dropped out of the Paris calendar. LVMH's flagship brand was already on the official program, with a slot scheduled for March 9, the last day of the French capital's womenswear fashion week, at 2.30 PM, but has postponed its virtual presentation by one day, meaning that it will now be unveiling its latest collection at 2.00 PM on March 10. First revealed by Italian fashion daily MF Fashion, the news was confirmed to FashionNetwork.com by a Louis Vuitton spokesperson, who did not provide further details. Fashion fans will therefore have to wait one more day to discover the women's ready-to-wear collection for Fall/Winter 2021-22 designed by the house's creative director, Nicolas Ghesquière
 
With the current pandemic situation, these sorts of program changes have become common, even at the last minute, and are often part of new communications strategies being adopted by fashion houses.Indeed, Louis Vuitton is not alone in choosing to push its digital presentation back until just after Paris Fashion Week. Alexandre Mattiussi, for example, has decided to reveal the new AMI collection in the days following the French event, on March 11, while Kenzo's presentation has been moved to March 26. 
 
Not to mention the chaos currently reigning over this February and March's fashion weeks, which include several overlapping presentations between New York, Milan and Paris. On Friday, February 26, for example, American designer Tom Ford will be revealing his collection for next Winter right in the middle of Milan Fashion Week, while on March 5, Italy's Versace will show during Paris' womenswear week.

"Feb 26, 2021","Post-modernist fashion is on the rise at Tod’s, where creative director Walter Chiapponi played ironically with many of the house’s codes in an eye-catching display. 
“It’s an ironic take on the Italian bourgeoise,” explained Chiapponi, as he walked around his showroom, patiently explaining multiple looks in a pre-show Zoom of the Fall/ Winter 2021 collection.
 
With the Milan season almost entirely devoted to video displays, Chiapponi delivered a gentlemanly tutorial on his newest ideas, which were all about stretching the DNA of the Italian fashion label.Using bows and volumes, materials and fabrics in unexpected ways all the way to the orange felt invitation, as soft as a baby’s bottom. 
Above all, Chiapponi showed he’s no slouch when it comes to playing with proportions – cutting leather trimmed trench coats so elaborately one could tie them up in knots below the waist; or deviating a classic CEO’s wife’s padded suede coat with an oversized peak collar.
 
Though his best moment were the futurist padded leather cocoon blousons in electric blue coats, or the padded nylon cabans, for the new downtown gal that Chiapponi is attracting.
 
Walter also played with the heart of the brand – its footwear, developing new two-tone moccasins; or jolting loafers with a new cone-shaped heel. Most notably, reinventing the signature piumino loafers with chunky heels and a hefty metal 'T'-logo buckle.
 
Nattily styled by Marie Chaix, this video had models marching up circular stairways; over terrazzo floors; and perching on classic modern furniture. 
Appearing in drainpipe-neck leather jackets; or double-face shearling teddy-bear coats and blousons. The result: a hip new urban gal. A smart move for Tod’s whose Italian lifestyle concept had become too deeply rooted in quaint Tuscan villas and junior grand dames in old palazzos.
 
“Manipulated couture ideas of volume,  and technical leather treatments. A funny and ironic approach. Women who remind me of cinematographic figures from Almodóvar or David Lynch,” explained the ever polite designer.
 
Make that Antonioni extras for the 21st century, with a sense of irony, of course.

"Feb 26, 2021","One felt like one got a ticket on a futuristic airline at Emporio Armani, as the master designer took his audience on a neon-drenched tour in Milan Fashion Week on Thursday afternoon.
 
His message: this fall, every youthful and happening hipster will be raring to travel again; and Giorgio Armani has got everything they will need in his wardrobe for them to have a great time.Staged in a darkened set, illuminated by a hyper-color neon version of Emporio Armani and its signature eagle logo, this video show even had a little wink to current Netflix hits – with a contemporary Daphne Bridgerton in a regency blue, pleated frock coat finished with an uber red, oversized fabric flower.
 
The deb’ had oodles of potential gentleman admirers – from the career minded chaps in perfectly cut suits with a fresh truncated double-breasted jacket with tapered pants, to the rugged playboys in black velour hoodies with contrasting matt bands. Yet there was nothing retro about these clothes for the gals - from the joyful pink tweed slouchy boleros or jaunty petrol blue mannish suits, to the feather trimmed chenille tops and graphic techy zig-zag print cocktail hour tuxedos.
 
And, in a moment when there’s yearn for a return to nature – and pretty much every show has an Aran look - Giorgio topped them all with an anthracite cable sweater and matching dressing gown combo. Kicked on by a great galactic trance soundtrack, the show also emphasized a techy element like the circuit-board prints coats with funnels collars. 
Half-way though, the show changed gears with a French touch; albeit more 'Emily in Milan' than in Paris. Berets, floaty mini jackets; black velvet mini skirts; cloche hats; beautiful gamine pant suits and even Balenciaga-like black, semi-cocoon nylon coats. 
 
During the pandemic, few designers have kept as quiet a profile as the octogenarian Armani, which, given his age, makes abundant sense. But though he has lain low, he has not been lying around.
 
This first rate collection was also all about a designer, and his team, working very hard. Helping to make sense of a dark moment in history by doing what they do best – creating flattering clothes for the moment everyone has been waiting for. When we can finally get on with our lives again.
 
The truth is, most designers know in their heart if they have just created a powerful collection. From Giorgio’s evident mirth as he took his bow, it was clear he knew he had just nailed this one.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 24, 2021","Italian brand Missoni kicked off the first day of Milan Fashion Week on Wednesday, with designers once again forced to swap the buzzing catwalks for digital presentations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.A year after Italy registered its first positive case of the coronavirus in the north, leading to the first lockdown in Europe, designers have had to find new ways to entice fashionistas with their creations.

Known for its zig-zag “Fiammato”, or flamed, pattern and colourful designs, Missoni was the first fashion house to stream a video of its latest womenswear, blending clothes for autumn/winter with those for spring/summer.Filmed earlier in February at Milan’s Assago Forum, a venue that has been shut for months, models re-enacted social gatherings from bowling games to catch-ups with friends.

They wore sparkling knits, loose trouser suits, long ribbed dresses and casual wear in an array of colours.

Some donned hats, scarves and jackets, while others modelled swimwear in the video, which was filmed as if in one continuous shot.

There were crop tops, shorts and glittering party wear as well in what the Italian fashion house described as “a celebration of the return to a normal social life”.
“With this project, I wanted to sum up one year of work in the length of a song, creating a content that is emotional but also accessible from different digital devices,” creative director Angela Missoni said in a statement.

“I mixed and matched pieces from different seasons to highlight the concept of wardrobe, since Missoni delivers items that are conceived to last, accompanying every woman in her life and becoming part of her memories.”

It was during last February’s Milan Fashion Week that the town of Codogno, about an hour’s drive from Milan, was closed off as the virus took hold in the Lombardy region, which became the worst-hit in Italy.

Then, veteran Giorgio Armani held his show behind closed doors in an empty theatre.

"Feb 24, 2021","(AFP) - Fashionistas will have to log on to soak up the glamour at Milan Fashion Week, which remains online a year after the coronavirus first swept into northern Italy.No sharply dressed crowds attended the extravaganza's opening on Wednesday: it's virtual catwalk shows only, with the likes of Armani and Prada presenting new women's collections for autumn and winter 2021-22.

The word ""coronavirus"" was just starting to pop up in conversations among members of the global style elite as they gathered for the February 2020 edition of Milan Fashion Week.Italy's first outbreak was taking hold in Codogno, an hour's drive away. That prompted Armani to announce it would present its collection behind closed doors -- a first in fashion history.

Covid-19 would quickly spread across Italy, prompting the first national lockdown in Europe as the crisis swiftly took on global proportions.

A year later, the global luxury sector is in dire economic straits, with few reasons to dress up as comfort-wear has become the new uniform for the housebound.

Milan organisers nevertheless intend the latest Fashion Week, which runs until March 1, to show that the industry can adapt in the face of crisis.

And there is hope that the arrival of vaccines will lead to a fashion bounce-back.Millions of eyeballsItaly's National Chamber of Fashion has set up a dedicated online hub for the week's events, which include 68 shows and 65 collection presentations.

Wednesday kicks off with ""We Are Made In Italy"", an event by the Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion collective, which has been pushing for greater diversity in the industry.

The next six days will see a parade of online catwalk shows, either live or pre-recorded, by brands including Prada, Moschino, Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Valentino.

Kim Jones, the celebrated British menswear designer of former Dior and Louis Vuitton fame, will also present his first ready-to-wear collection for Fendi.

In the brave new world of virtual fashion weeks, the success of the latest Milan edition will be measured in terms of how many eyeballs it manages to reach.

The last Milan Fashion Week, in September, reached more than 43 million views on the event's exclusive streaming channel, with partners including the New York Times and China's Tencent Video relaying the footage worldwide.

According to analysis by media monitor DMR, the shows also reached more than 600 million users on social media.Vaccines: saviours of fashion?The Italian fashion sector's revenues plunged 45 percent in the second quarter of 2020 -- the height of the lockdown -- but losses for the year as a whole are estimated at 26 percent.

The National Chamber of Fashion released a Fashion Economic Trends study earlier this month, looking at various factors that could shape the industry's recovery in the medium to long term.

In the most optimistic scenario, a successful mass vaccination campaign and strong support for businesses as they emerge from the crisis could lead to growth of around 15 percent, the report predicted.

But if restrictions on commercial and social life continue until 2022 as authorities struggle to stamp out the virus, the bounce back could be limited to six percent growth, it said.

Italy's brand-new government, led by former European Bank Chief Mario Draghi, is currently weighing the best way out of a crisis that has claimed more than 95,000 lives in the country and savaged the economy.

"Feb 24, 2021","Kim Jones appreciates a powerful woman; like the Fendi sisters or the latter-day empresses of style that starred in his first women’s ready-to-wear collection for the fashion house. 
Unveiled Wednesday, the opening day of Milan Fashion Week, Jones' first ready-to-wear collection for the Roman house was the biggest debut of the Italian season.
 
Like in his Fendi couture debut last month in Paris, which finished with a gang of veteran models, and their occasional offspring, perched inside giant glass boxes, Jones furnished his ready-to-wear video with large containers again. Though this time, they contained the ruins of ancient Rome - emperors' and empresses' heads, classical ionic columns, gravestones, fountains and plinths.Through this maze marched his cast - opening with a splendid ribbed mink coat, followed by beauties in oodles of beige – simple silk sheathes worn with boots, alpaca trenches or blazers; shaggy sheepskin coats and cleverly cut pinstripe dresses. The mood was clean and cool and crisp, and echoed the taste of the five Fendi sisters who made up the second generation of the founding family. 
“The Fendi family are women of intellect who work hard – and that’s what I wanted to celebrate. A powerful dynasty,” said Jones in his program notes.
 
Jones was certainly not afraid to flaunt the house’s fur heritage – showing hipster grand-dame herringbone shaved-mink cocktails and coats finished on one side with long paw frills. Or pairing mink jerkins trimmed in snakeskin with elongated jodhpurs.
 
Though staged without a live audience, this was very much a runway show and not a video lookbook. Infinitely classy and very Roman, there was also a movie star glamour to the whole display, even if the tight camera angles made it hard to see the clothes.
 
Jones’ Minerva from the Monterey Hills smouldered in a white fur dress and matching backpack; his Agrippina from Angelino Heights in a mannish ecru mink double-breasted coat that reeked rich; while his Los Feliz Livia Drusilla emoted in a utilitarian flight jacket – an old favorite look of Silvia Fendi - over jodhpurs. 
Jones also developed some great new cable-stitched bags with selleria detailing and a new mini baguette; and embraced the famed double-'F' logo first designed by Karl Lagerfeld – seen on silk pyjama pants, tights and copper-hued silk cocktails.

Practically every look enhanced by gold chain-linked necklaces or pendants, some wax sealed and stamped with the house’s familiar Karligraphy. Plenty of flesh on display in a largely obscure, yet astutely edited cast, with uber runway stars absent from Milan due to the pandemic. In the show, another formidable female - Delfina Delettrez Fendi - introduces a new jewellery range, Fendi O’Lock, completed with padlocks one can only open by dialling in Fendi.
 
All told, a stylish and commercial collection right in synch with a current yearning for plausible clothes that feel and look opulent and hyper-luxurious.

"Feb 24, 2021","Priya Ahluwalia, ""a pioneer in responsible sourcing and manufacturing techniques"", has received The Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design.The British Fashion Council (BFC) Award, presented by The Countess of Wessex, on behalf of The Queen during a virtual event, recognised Ahluwalia’s “active contribution to changing the industry for the better”.

Her sustainably-minded menswear collections, made of dead stock and repurposed locally-sourced vintage materials, “combine elements and influences from her Nigerian and Indian heritage, making her designs truly unique”, the citation added. “She is a progressive thinking leader and agent for change who has used her platform to raise awareness around the challenges of the Black community, especially in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement”, it added.

Caroline Rush, BFC chief executive, said: “Ahluwalia’s unique and ethical design process combined with her ability and passion to give back to communities around London and the globe make her an inspiration for many young British designers. We are incredibly proud to recognise Priya and look forward to seeing her business grow.”

The inaugural Award was announced and presented to Richard Quinn  three years ago when The Queen made her first visit to London Fashion Week. Other recipients include Bethany Williams and Rosh Mahtani.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 23, 2021","After New York and London, it is now Milan’s turn to roll - mostly online. This season, with the pandemic exacerbated by the spread of new Covid-19 variants, the Milan women's fashion week will once again be held chiefly in virtual mode. A format that has the advantage of being flexible, enabling the event to feature a king-size programme with a total of 140 presentations, showcasing the ready-to-wear collections for the Fall/Winter 2021-22.
 Milan Fashion Week is scheduled from Tuesday, Feb. 23 until Monday March 1. It will truly get going on Wednesday 24 with the first of the catwalk shows, of which there are no fewer than 68 on the calendar. The rest of the programme includes 65 presentations and seven special events, among them a gala evening organised by the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) for the fashion week’s opening. The date is set for the evening of February 24, with the DJs from Milan’s Club Domani party nights ... online of course, putting safety first.
 
Only two of the catwalk shows will actually be staged physically. The first is scheduled on Wednesday, by Daniel Del Core, the former stylist to Gucci's celebrity clients, launching his own Del Core label. The second show will close the fashion week on Monday March 1, alongside Dolce & Gabbana, and will be staged by Valentino behind closed doors at the Piccolo Teatro, a unique opportunity for the renowned Milanese theatre to re-open its doors after twelve months of lockdown.Besides these two shows, another highlight will be the eagerly awaited presentation of the first women's ready-to-wear collection by Kim Jones for Fendi, scheduled on Wednesday. On Saturday, another debut, the first collection by Alessandro Dell’Acqua for Italian plus-size specialist Elena Mirò, making a come-back on the Milanese calendar after a 10-year absence.
 
Versace will notably give this season a miss, and will unveil its new collection online on March 5, overlapping with the Paris Fashion Week. Also absent is Gucci, which is now positioned outside the official seasons. But all the other leading Italian labels will be present, many of them with videos and innovative presentation formats.
 
Antonio Marras has set his video, which will be broadcast on Friday, within the prehistoric nuraghic complex of Barumini in Sardinia. On the same day, Marni will stage a three-act presentation, inviting the audience to discover its new collection at breakfast, lunch and dinner. On Saturday, Giorgio Armani will present its latest collection with two separate films, one for womenswear and one for menswear. Another novelty, and a first for Milan, is the collective video showcasing the work of 20 selected students from the Polimoda academy in Florence. 
There are 14 debut names on the calendar. Starting on Friday with Pierre-Louis Mascia, a French fashion illustrator who launched his own label in 2007, in partnership with Italian fabric manufacturer Achille Pinto, now a majority shareholder.
 
The other new entries on the Milanese calendar, besides Del Core and Alessandro dell’Acqua x Elena Mirò, are Brunello Cucinelli; the ‘We are Made in Italy’ show by the Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion collective; Onitsuka Tiger, the fashion sibling of Japanese sport brand Asics; Fabio Quaranta, a Milan catwalk show regular; and Maxivive, the androgynous label founded in 2007 by Papa Oyeyemi, a designer based in Lagos, Nigeria, renowned for his experimental approach.
 
Also, Dima Leu, an emerging talent from Moldova who first showed in Milan last month with menswear; Korean label Münn by Hyun-min Han; the Budapest Select collective show, promoting Hungarian designers; the brand new label by Alessandro Vigilante, formerly with Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Philosophy; CHB, the label launched in the midst of the lockdown period by experienced designer Christian Boaro, formerly with Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Ferré and MSGM. And notably, the maiden event by engineering graduate and promising new Italian talent Giuseppe Buccinnà, who founded his label in 2015.
 
Among the presentations, some of which will be open to buyers and journalists while fully complying with current health protection rules, there will be the Milanese debuts by Moorer, Gonçalo Peixoto, Alabama Muse, Bacon, Push Button for Fila Korea, Peserico, Yatay, Canadian, Oof Wear, Revenant RV NT, AC9, Des Phemmes and Nervi.

"Feb 23, 2021","London Fashion Week ended Tuesday night after five days and scores of virtual shows, presentations and debates, with a stellar show by Simone Rocha, and the latest Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Fashion being given to Priya Ahluwalia. In a hyper-colourful season after this dark period in history, designers created bold broken graphics or churned up floral prints; and anchored scores of looks in platforms, which made a major return. Though the key theme was about the longing for artistic ladylike fashion for women, and hyper practicality for men. Here are five key moments from the final 24 hours in the UK season.
 Simone Rocha: Pinafore princesses in perfect PerfectosAlmost the last major designer of the largely virtual London season to present her collection was Simone Rocha, who unveiled an actual runway show, albeit sans audience, inside a deconsecrated church.
 
Rocha has been for good half decade one of the half dozen most important designers in the UK, and top 20 in Europe, and this collection will only serve to cement her reputation. Loosely entitled 'The Three Graces,' where the graces were satin, leather and tulle - the trio of disparate fabrics that Simone handled with wit and sophistication for Fall/ Winter 2021.
 
Few people do volume with as much élan as Simone, who opened with a series of great new Perfectos, worn over tutus, leggings and platforms; or cut brilliantly into bubble coats; or paired with a long white shirt-collar and tie. All the way to her penultimate look – a Perfecto in pink organza with delicately embroidered fabric flowers.
 
Rocha covered patch pockets in giant fabrics; trimmed mannish pointy collars with crystals; bedecked ears with huge pearls and rubies and decorated cocoon trenches. All shot with smooth grandeur by partner and photographer Eoin McLoughlin.
 
Her rock 'n' roll restoration moll rebels donned chopped-up wigs and ladles of rouge or came with spiky cornrow hairstyles. Strolling past the stained glass windows of the church in Pinball Wizard pearl platforms. Gothic Lolitas at a spiritual fashion ceremony, about to exit and face inclement weather in green Aran sweater dresses and scrunched up parkas. Cool Catherine de' Medicis on the Central line.
 
“Thinking of clothes in a protective and practical way, fragile rebels. Lost and found, interior wallpaper prints gaining a sense of place but patched-worked together to disorientate. Structured, sculpted leather; harnessing and resisting, creeping flowers. Uniformity & naivety,” explained Rocha in one of her stream of consciousness program notes, well summing up the disparate yet divine nature of her fashion philosophy.
 Roksanda: A sonnet to three generationsThe virtual UK season’s most touching moment had to be Roksanda’s video featuring three generations from one family of inspiring women.
 
Named 'Friday in February,' it starred Vanessa Redgrave, Joely Richardson and Daisy Bevan, wearing Roksanda’s Fall/ Winter 2021 collection, wandering around a garden, playing cards and quietly enjoying a picture-perfect English manor. As the 84-year-old legend Oscar winner recites Shakespeare’s Sonnet 73, about the dimming of the fires of youth and the importance of love in old age.
 
Shot via iPhone in creative collaboration between Roksanda, and director and photographer, Linda Brownlee, this tender vision worked perfectly for these clothes. From the voluminous hammered satin gowns to the fantastic silk dresses in prints of the female form to the stunning moiré taffeta or silk organza dresses hand painted with broad brush-strokes in meadow blush or merlot.
 
All projected onto some of Roksanda’s favorite buildings across London as darkness fell on the capital in a poignant moment.
 Dunhill: Compendium clobber for multi-purpose livingThis season at the venerable house, designer Mark Weston focused again on the clothes rather than the narrative; concentrating on fabrication and detailing.
 
His big idea was based on an archive piece called a compendium, which managed to be a compact cigarette case, lighter, watch and knife all in one.  The result was a multi-functional coat, also the Compendium, which he described in a morning Zoom with editors as the  “complete opposite of disposability.”
 
Created in a cocoon shapes and made in silk moiré – like a multipurpose anorak; or developed from the shorn fibres of sheep, which were knitted together to make a faux shearling, but half as light. Other looks to impress were cunningly frayed collarless jackets and graphic vertical ribbed Aran sweaters. Many combos based on natty new ergonomic brothel creepers and quilted sneakers.
 
Using Italian mills, Weston dreamed up great graphic yet abstract floral silks, then used them inside-out for tunics, Mao jackets and excellent cummerbunds. Ideal for evening, even if there was also a large dose of domesticity – like knitted scarves, inspired by  those Weston’s mum sewed for him and his brother as kids. Echoed on the mood board by a photo of Brian Eno in a striped sweater.
 
“Eno? He stands for innovation and different ways of thinking, which what I am all about at Dunhill,” explained Weston.
 The Queen Elizabeth II Award for British FashionAnd the winner is Priya Ahluwalia, the LVMH Prize finalist, who draws inspiration from both her Nigerian and Indian heritage.
 
Back in 2018, the Queen caused a sensation by showing up at an actual fashion show, beaming delightedly as she witnessed the show by the debut winner of her award, Richard Quinn.
 
Since then, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, formerly Camilla Parker Bowles, presented the prize to Bethany Williams and Alighieri's Rosh Mahtani, in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
 
Making the announcement, Caroline Rush, the Chief Executive of the British Fashion Council, explained that the Duchess of Cornwall had chosen Ahluwalia, praising the designer “for responsible sourcing and manufacturing techniques and for telling the stories of the communities that she works with.”
 
The show video, shot in a Masonic lodge-style interior, featured a group of all-black male models wearing Ahluwalia’s signature graphic street-smart tailoring as they marched around as a sax player played mournful jazz on a central podium. Clever fashion making Ahluwalia look like a worthy winner.
 Erdem: Margot Fonteyn MoraliogluLast but not least, Erdem by designer Erdem Moralioglu, who is justly famed for his narrative skills when it comes to fashion shows.
 
This season he set his fashion video inside a dark space and took his cast to the ballet, as if the audience was in the wings watching as privileged friends.
 
The models were four Royal Ballet ballerinas marching into wells of light, evoking the halcyon era in dance when Rudolf Nureyev performed with Margot Fonteyn. She was 42, he just 23; but their synergy gave them a certain unique energy.
 
Hence rehearsal-style clinging knits were mixed up with refined leaf-print coats in the palest of greys; while others came with cantilevered backs.

For evening, when invited out by admirers, the ladies donned marvellous feather or marbleized print dresses, rich in crystals, bugle beads and strass.  Their big sisters – like veteran Marguerite Porter, who actually danced with Nureyev - looking magnificent in grand-dame black organza dresses, bejewelled in crystals.
 
Courtly, cool, classy and cleverly filmed in the Bridge Theatre, and a great way to bring the London season to a close.

"Feb 22, 2021","Though February is traditional the season of women’s ready-to-wear in London, this month Burberry staged a purely menswear collection, and entitled it 'Escapes.' 
These clothes marked the first time that the house’s Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci had presented a “menswear-focused” collection for Burberry. It turned out to be a tailoring tour de force by Riccardo, presented in one of Tisci’s favored sets – multiple levels of pale plywood and corrugated beige curtains.
 
Pre-show, the Italian set the mood by pampering certain VIPs and editors - sending them all modernist safari chairs, on which was printed the exact geographic co-ordinates of the show. Staged inside the brand’s London headquarters at Horseferry House in Westminster, online and with no live audience on Monday, the fourth day of the five-day London Fashion Week.While on social media, the designer showed videos of fit young men racing through parks and countryside before ending up in center of London; camera shots rotating around the heads of his cast, or images of the show invitation featuring 'Wilderness' being carefully sewn on a sweatshirt.
 
Tisci began and continued with Burberry’s signature garment, the trench coat. But his were trenches with a difference; showing them with a classic front but cut off at the back as a ribbed jerkin. Presenting them in classic beige or muddy plaids. Others came lapel-free recalling the early '60s style of Pierre Cardin; still others in ingenious pleated finishes.
 
Tisci does loves a man in a skirt, this season showing knee-length looks in a bashed metallic cooper or others in Fortuny-worthy multi-pleats. Worn with natty PVC leggings, ideal for a cool cèilidh at a Highland Wedding.
 
Steadycam cameramen following each model around the undulating set, even the only two gals – pouting veteran Edie Campbell and another blonde. The set riffing on the wandering terrain of Burberry’s renovated flagship on Regent Street.
 
And with North Americans suffering through a giant ice storm, Tisci had the ideal gear: marvelous Yeti rapper coats in battleship-gray faux fur; or mighty duffle coats with patch Velcro straps, finished with rural mayor silk scarf belts. All topped by deer motif beanies and anchored by boots sculpted to look like hooves. Wilderness indeed.
 
For more studious moments like walking to the library in a leafy university, he showed faux-fur V-neck cricket sweaters; double 'B'-logo Varsity baseball jackets, sometimes sleeveless; or great padded patchwork work shirts.
 
Like all major fashion brands, Burberry has been buffeted by the lockdown, though its 4% drop in revenue to £688 million in the final quarter of last year meant it performed better than many of its rivals. So, considering that 15% of its stores closed, Tisci’s ideas for Burberry are clearly finding a following.
 
So, while this collection may have been entitled 'Wilderness' and 'Escapes,' Tisci and Burberry are far from being in the commercial boondocks, far from it.

"Feb 21, 2021","The biggest problem with being a fashion designer these days is that it’s no longer enough to create great clothes. Today, you have to be a 360 designer, knowledgeable about design, merchandising, social media and fashion politics, and, vitally in this pandemic, talented at presenting collections virtually. This weekend’s shows in the five-day London Fashion Week, which kicked off on Friday, underlined that conundrum, as several very talented designers struggled to make powerful fashion statements in videos, and other junior names wowed with exciting electronic visions. 
 Stephen JonesSix weeks after Brexit came into effect, it turned out the most inventive ideas in London this Sunday were from hatter Stephen Jones, who called his collection ""French Kiss."" An ode to all things Gallic, inspired by his youth, when posh punk met Les Enfants du Paradis. More about the myth of Paris than the actual scene, the hats incorporated multiple French symbols, from Longchamp racegoers and Bal des Victimes aristocrats to badass sans-culottes revolutionaries and beret-wearing existentialist 1968ers. All the way to a remarkable work of millinery sculpture featuring the intertwined lips of a man and tongue of a woman.

""Once Paris has got to you, there is no escape,"" smiled Jones, who said the hats were designed for after women had taken off their clothes and were about to make love. How very French.Bianca Saunders Man Ray would have loved the 55-second clip from Bianca Saunders, another designer that referenced French culture this season in London. Inspired by Jean Cocteau’s 1930 film The Blood of a Poet, a cult classic that featured fashion icon Lee Miller in her only film role. With shots through keyholes of a dashingly handsome male model attired in several great looks: like a scrunched-up Aran sweater, shrunken-shouldered tuxedos or Norfolk jackets in great crumpled or creased photo prints. Surrealist chic for the 21st century.
 Bethany WilliamsThis was more like a tutorial than a fashion presentation, and why not? As Bethany Williams personally introduced her gender-neutral, patchwork-driven collection, to be retailed initially exclusively by Selfridges. Based on vintage blankets sourced across the UK, the result was a series of great mega-color organic multi-panel coats that all had fantastic kick. This Liverpudlian designer continues to create unique visions in fashion and long may that continue.
 N PalmerThis two-minute series of images by Nicholas Palmer recalled a cheapo clip made for The Old Grey Whistle Test when the BBC had no money. Sounded like vintage Pink Floyd, looked far too retro. Fake paisley, slicing graphics, acid dreams, seen in party shirts, crisscross paisley clubbing tops and patchwork tanks. Meaning, N Palmer just about got away with it, but will have to try much harder next season...
 16ArlingtonThere is a scene in Woody Allen’s flick Stardust Memories, when the actor is in a train compartment of dull individuals, and desperately desires to cross the tracks to a wagon of beautiful people. 16Arlington’s 48-second video was like that: ""how can I meet these people and buy their clothes?"" one wondered. Cobalt blue feather boa cocktails; sexy courtesan suits with foot-long collars and lapels; naughty abbess coats; beautiful bodycon black silk cocktails embroidered with copper thread. All inspired by the hypnotic works of artist Hubert Duprat, in whose Caddis collection caddisfly larvae are captured furnishing protective cocoons from gold leaf, opals, coral and diamonds. 16Arlington is created by Marco Capaldo and Kikka Cavenati and in less than one minute at LFW they established themselves as a vital new force in UK fashion.
 Art SchoolOne house that really knows how to stage a video show is Art School, who created their dark-as-night set inside a London warehouse. The clothes – practically all in black, dark red, ecru or orange glitter: bedraggled silk cocktail dresses, oversized magician’s cloaks, chopped-up trenches, faux priestly vestments and night watchmen’s uniforms. There was nothing earth shatteringly original about these clothes by Art School’s designer Eden Loweth, but the label sure knows how to shoot a video.
 Preen by Thornton BregazziOn their day, Preen are one of the most exciting fashion labels anywhere, but where their live shows are often epic avant garde works of performance art, their videos tend to underwhelm. They did again on Sunday, with a faux indie Super 8 flick about gals at a rural estate. Inspired by that old warhorse of an inspiration, Grey Gardens, this collection of dead stock and recycled materials felt like recycled ideas. Quilted floral looks; ruffled schoolmarm on a blind date gowns; and chunky knits all added up to a less than stellar performance.
 Jamie Wei HuangThis collection can only be described as derivative: aping elements of classic American sportswear and high street knitwear. But, nonetheless, Jamie Wei Huang sure shot a great video. The clip, entitled ""Detour,"" featured a series of chiseled-jawed Asian beauties and beaus wandering around a wild rock outcrop before a stormy sea. Backed up by a kick-ass hard rock band named Fei Cheng and starring dancer Yu-Hsien Wu and actor Guan-Zhi Huang, there was little new under the sun about these clothes, but still, the fashion clip left a smile on your face.

"Feb 21, 2021","One true test of any great artist, or significant designer, is whether or not they have an identifiable signature style. One of many reasons that Molly Goddard has become one of the most important creators in UK fashion, and a star event at London Fashion Week.
 For few designers anywhere today have such an instantly detectable DNA and style as Goddard. She showed that right from the first look in the video she displayed on Saturday evening, the second day of London Fashion Week.
 
A dense cumulus of puckered fiery red and black organza shaped into a modernist crinoline and worn over golden Pinball Wizard platforms. If you spotted the look 1,000 yards away on a busy avenue, it would still trumpet Goddard.Not that Molly wasn’t afraid to break new ground – like her posh punk version of Clan Stewart tartan in a dressing gown coat, worn with varsity scarf and busy gal satchel.
 
And she managed to powerfully inject freshness into her oeuvre with several guys’ outfits in a coed video – like a combo of tartan kilt, grandpa Fair Isle sweater and a Melton Mowbray hacking jacket – again worn with platforms. Later she mixed together the Gilbert O’Sullivan knits with chiffon party dresses in another clever combo. And, Molly also managed to be highly commercial with uber-ladylike double-breasted felted woolen coats in deep sherbet tones.
 
Like many in lockdown over these past 12 months, Goddard retreated to her own book shelves for inspiration – mingling in elements of Tina Barney’s Europeans, David Douglas Duncan’s Goodbye Picasso and Terence Conran interiors, in a panorama that included ""archive folders of photocopied research, which I have compiled over the past 15 years or so.""
 
The result was a first-rate collection, where the heart of the matter were a series of beautiful prom dresses in marvelous shades of marbled taffeta, woven using 100% recycled yarn, or bright tangerine or sea green silks. Cut and ruched with great imagination and featuring ideally placed spiky bows and rough knots, they immediately stated groovy Goddard at her best.
 
That said, Goddard, like quite a few very talented designers, still has not got the virtual format right. This was a rather lame video of models merging from behind a dull red curtain to walk individually around a yellow space, which turned out to be her studio in Bethnal Green.  
 ""I like the consistency of showing in the same space, almost like a Parisian salon show, but wanted to make the space warm and glowing gold. Wintry but optimistic,"" argued Goddard.
 
However, even given the restrictions of the pandemic, this overly simple formula undersold the collection.
 
A small quibble, however, given just how pretty, optimistic and flattering this collection and all these clothes were. Plus, the hair styles had a suitably offbeat and wild Wuthering Heights mood, combined with doll-like peachy makeup. All told, a great fashion statement by Goddard, a designer who builds momentum, unleashes ideas and trends, and enhances her reputation with every show.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 20, 2021","A star was born at London Fashion Week on Saturday, albeit it virtually in Barcelona rather than in Blighty. 
Her name – Sonia Carrasco, an alumni of the houses of both Celine and Alexander McQueen, who unveiled her second eponymous collection via a video shot around substantial works of landscape art and storied statues in Barcelona.
 
Only one model, dance muse Carla Cervantes, which slightly muffled the effect. For no matter how well they move, few ballerinas ever have the statuesque appeal of trained runway models.That quibble aside, this was a great first fashion display from Carrasco, who dreamed up a series of really great suits. Some cut like tuxedoes with quirky versions of classic pants, others made up of sharp angle blazers and shirts worn askew.
 
As the video unspooled, Carrasco added in striking offbeat Aran sweater cocktails – a big trend in the season where ecological ideas are uppermost. Her sense of detailing was ideal – embroidering shards of chiffon onto a great thin white duchess suit.
 
The Valencia, Spain-born designer was also sufficiently self-assured to develop her own signature monogram, inspired by the Barracas typical of her hometown. The motif was present in suits, shirts, dresses and a new bodysuit, made of recycled cotton and recycled wool knitwear.
 
Carrasco entitled the collection -75.500000, -106.750000, after the co-ordinates of the Thwaites Glacier, the giant glacier in Western Antarctica, endangered by rapid thawing due to global warming. As a result, the materials came in natural hues – sand, earthy brown, tropical green and navy. 
Shot before huge sculptures in squares, beneath Mediterranean cliffs or before gray beaches in the Catalan capital, this catalogue of sharp tailoring marked Carrasco out as very much a designer to watch.
 
""The video aims to express that pain we feel when we are incapable of achieving something, a reflection on what will happen in the coming months, the desperate desire to go out, wanting to do things, seeing people and not being able to. Knowing that it is physically possible but morally impossible. Art therefore becomes the temporary remedy allowing the mind to travel and free itself,"" explained the designer, echoing a common opinion in the midst of the pandemic and potential global environmental disaster.

"Feb 19, 2021","Few designers love the whole process of creation as much as Edward Crutchley, who presented the first truly significant collection on the opening day of London Fashion Week.In an essentially virtual season online, on Friday Crutchley talked his audience through his latest video and ideas – like working with Johnstons of Elgin on two impressive fabrics – a marvelous watercolor-effect leopard jacquard and a new tweed done in 100% cashmere.
 
His opening image was of a stern beauty in headscarf, large curlers and an oversized jacket in the aforementioned leopard print.Cashmere throughout - from uber comfortable hoodies to pirate caps – all culled from the same fabric resource, whose materials are washed by the chemical-free waters of Scottish rivers.
 
Though the highlights of the collection were the fabulous ornithological prints of exotic birds, seen in great silk tops and shirts. Crutchley frequently underlined British fabric suppliers in his video, as he narrated the whole show. But he also spoke of Continental suppliers like Gentili Mosconi in Como, which dreamed up some great cloudy moirés. Seen in a memorably dandy combo of roomy pants and clubbing jerkin. Rock star material par excellence. Other looks came in moirés taken from 100% recycled polyester made in Lyon.
 
Though his most bravura concept was a marble-printed merino wool tailored jacket – courtesy of Ratti of Italy – with a dramatic image of Renaissance revelers. The same material used in flat caps, from master London milliner Stephen Jones. 
“While we have a strong British sourcing approach, it was also important for us not to feel bound to Britain. Not to feel exclusionist. And to continue working with our partners in Europe,” stressed the designer, in the first London season since Brexit began closing borders with Europe.
 
Crutchley’s evening job is assisting Kim Jones at Dior in Paris, where visitors to the design studio know he has an encyclopedic recall of the multiple couture techniques used in the that house’s menswear.
 
All told, this was the latest excellent collection from Edward Crutchley who somehow manages never to let his more outrageous concepts topple over his clothes. Without doubt the freshest mind in London menswear this past half decade.

"Feb 19, 2021","Tod’s has unveiled its debut project of Tod’s Academy, a novel link-up with students at Central Saint Martins, available on a new high-tech online platform.The Italian luxury marque timed the launch for the opening day of the latest London Fashion Week, a five-day largely virtual season which runs until Tuesday, Feb. 23.
 
In a clever twist, a total of 35 young designers chosen in a “borderless selection” from the masters course of the famed college spent several months working on individual interpretations of one or more of Tod’s codes.“We had the idea at the hardest moment of the pandemic last spring when we asked ourselves, 'what could we do to help young designers?' And this project helps support these young creatives and involves them in a project with great artisans. And, to help with their formation by bringing them close to great designers, editors and stylists,” explained Diego Della Valle, Tod’s hard-charging CEO and controlling shareholder, in a pre-launch Zoom. 
Conceived as “a laboratory of ideas” linked to the brand’s HQ in the Marche region of Italy, Tod’s Academy assigned each student a highly experienced mentor. These included happening designers like Simone Rocha, Roksanda Ilinčić, Charles Jeffrey or Richard Quinn; noted editors such as Emanuele Farneti or Hamish Bowles; PR whizzes like Lucien Pages; cool stylists like Andrew Davis or Francesca Burns and master merchants like Carla Sozzani or Ruth Chapman.
 
“I’d like to thank all these very talented many people so very much for making themselves available to help the next generation,” added Della Valle, attired in one of his signature foulards, sitting in front of an antique globe.
 
In a busy day of some 30 events in London, Tod’s unveiled its independent digital dedicated platform at 4.15 p.m. GMT, with an official listing on the London Fashion Week schedule. In effect, it is a virtual exhibition of the students' inventiveness.Each tutorial was recorded, and the final presentations were videoed, as can be seen on the platform, as the project pushes students towards innovative ways of working, by delving into their own histories; as they present their takes on Tod’s classics like the 'D' bag, Gommino moccasin or 'T Timeless' bag.
 
The concept was jointly conceived by Della Valle and Fabio Piras, the course director of Central Saint Martins' MA Fashion Course, who coordinated the project. Tod’s Academy does not encompasses producing any of the ideas for commercial release, but it was clearly a fertile feeding ground for inventive ideas.
 
Videos capture students running ideas by mentors; presenting moodboards; or ruminating on their inspiration. Stars like Rocha or Ilinčić admiring and nurturing work by new generation students such as Andrej Gronaj or Andrew La Casse. 
La Casse reinvented classic Tod’s ideas like the Gommino with new closures and shapes, or as platforms. Developed as full-knitted small bags; or ballerina slippers with rubber studs. While La Casse looked at new materiality, infusing sustainability by employing Pinatex, a pineapple derivative; and revamping a classic sandal by flattening and adding adjustable straps.
 
Looking ahead, Della Valle suggested that Tod’s may later collaborate with other noted fashion schools, in the U.S., China or Italy. He sees no end date for the platform, which will act as a digital space allowing Tod’s to mount other new initiatives.
 
“I believe that the St Martins students also learned about the speed of creation, when you have an atelier and artisans. And also about how Tod’s represents the Italian lifestyle, and they can learn from that. I was very impressed by the sheer quality of the work and by the quality of the talent from the school. Fabio Piras is clearly doing a very good job finding and developing talent,” smiled the Tod’s CEO.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 19, 2021","Gabriela Hearst keeps on getting better.
 
For her latest show for her eponymous label, and the last before she debuts with her evening job as the new creative director of Chloé in Paris, Hearst riffed on the ideas of the 11th century philosopher and mystic, Saint Hildegard of Bingen. The result was a classy and composed collection that managed to be both contemporary and cool, unveiled Tuesday night in New York. 
Hearst smartly juxtaposed the clothes in a suitably gritty show video, shot in a light-filled riverside warehouse with corrugated iron walls underneath the Williamsburg Bridge, in a lush piece of direction by Alexandre de Betak.
 
Each look expressed a new maturity and conviction in Hearst’s work, which Hildegard – an abbess who corresponded with popes and emperors - would surely have appreciated.  Opening with flowing cloaks; long knitted dresses and some excellent trench coats – finished with shoulder knots or hoods. For day, showing stylish Swiss lace frocks; Aran sweater cocktail dresses or precise leather macramé looks worn over polo necks. For evening, flowing satin dresses over flared white pants or snazzy thick-ribbed knit cocktails all looked great.“St. Hildegard was a composer, poet, philosopher, mystic, linguist, botanist, and medical theorist. If she were born a man we would all know her name as we know Leonardo da Vinci’s. Her visions that started at an early age began her spiritual journey that can only be made with true passion. She saw that the answer was in the Green Power of Nature,” argued Hearst in her program notes.
 
After seeing her 12-tear-old daughter Mia placing flowers in her art book, and then carefully replicating them, Hearst used these as prints – “knitted and crocheted with two non-for-profit women empowering co-ops we work with in Uruguay and Bolivia.” The results were some great woolen ensembles and charming skirts and tanks.
 
Mia’s prints were also the basis for the patterns in the Swiss lace and leather macramé looks, climaxing with classy town coats, whose lower halves morphed into lace.  Cool ethnic blanket looks, from patchwork ponchos to country weekend coats referenced Hearst’s youth in Uruguay, adding high color to the collection.A true polyglot, Hildegard wrote three volumes of theology; two volumes on natural medicines and cures; invented her own language and composed sacred monophony – there are more surviving chants by her than any composer from the Middle Ages.
 
The designer’s soundtrack was an original composition too. By Uruguayan artist Juan Campodonico, adding a quick step beat to the show video, wihich ended with Hildegard Hearst taking an extended tour down the massive warehouse.
 
Sauntering out through the battered doors onto the East River, in a great symbolic exit, as she sets off on the next stage of her career – conquering Paris.

"Feb 19, 2021","Sonia Rykiel will return to the Paris runway season with virtual show on Sunday Feb. 28, marking an important step in the revival of the famed house as it finally emerges from a financial meltdown. 
The collection will be exclusively in knitwear, befitting a house founded by Sonia Rykiel, whose nickname was Queen of the Knits. It will be created by an in-house design team, appointed by the maison’s new owners, Eric and Michael Dayan, two French e-entrepreneur brothers.
 
Rykiel confirmed that it will unveil a fall/winter 2021 collection at 6 p.m. Sunday next week, the eve of the next, largely virtual, Paris Fashion Week.The house will also invite editors and buyers to private appointments to view the collection in the following week. Though not at its historic headquarters in Saint-Germain, but across the river Seine in a brand new showroom in the eighth arrondissement.
 
The legendary Parisian label went into receivership back in April 2019, after its Chinese backers ceased financing operations. In the previous year, the house suffered net losses of 30 million euros on revenues of 35 million euros.
 
The house was eventually acquired by the Dayan brothers, who are now poised to relaunch the storied marque.
 
When the company was liquidated, it had 131 employees and operated six directly owned stores. None of the founding family remain involved in the house of Sonia Rykiel. The designer passed away in 2016 at the age of 86.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 19, 2021","London Fashion Week begins on Friday on a virtual format due to a coronavirus lockdown with mainstays like Victoria Beckham shunning the event but others like Burberry embracing the online avatar.Despite the absence of global celebrities and fashionistas, designers such as Turkey's Bora Aksu, Britain's Molly Goddard and Ireland's Simone Rocha will stream their collections on the London Fashion Week website.

Most of the 94 designers participating in the show, which concludes on Tuesday, will broadcast video highlights of their collections showcasing menswear, womenswear or mixed fashions in an event that is now gender-neutral.On Monday, the British brand Burberry -- known for its tailored trenchcoats -- will present its menswear Autumn/Winter collection for 2021, designed by Italian creative director Riccardo Tisci.

In September, the brand presented its Spring/Summer 2021 collection in a film set in the middle of a forest and broadcast live on Twitch.

The streaming platform has grown in popularity, broadcasting live video gameplay and offering the possibility of live commentary.

More than 40,000 people watched the innovative show, which could be viewed from different perspectives.Impact of BrexitFormer Spice Girl and designer Victoria Beckham will present her creations a few days before London Fashion Week.

Her collection, which mixes the seasons, aims to be ""optimistic but realistic"", she explained.

Beckham has been living under coronavirus lockdown in Florida, where her husband, former England football captain David Beckham, is now one of the co-owners of the American professional soccer club Inter Miami.

During the pandemic, the former pop star said ""people still want to dress up"" but with ""a need for comfort"".

Her designs include military details that evoke a ""sense of protection -- a toughness"", she added.

Her collection also exhibits a lighter, more delicate side with dresses made from Jersey fabric or with prints of flowers and goldfish.

The more joyful designs are in stark contrast to the grim outlook for the fashion industry in Britain, seriously impacted by the pandemic.

The UK suffered more than 118,000 Covid-19 deaths and has been under national lockdown measures since January.

The fashion sector, which employs more than 890,000 people and contributed £35 billion ($48 million, 39 billion euros) to UK GDP in 2019, has also been hit by Brexit and the end of free movement between the EU and the island nation.

In early February, hundreds of fashion figures, -- including top former models like Twiggy and Yasmin Le Bon -- signed an open letter, coordinated by the industry forum Fashion Roundtable, warning the sector risked being decimated because of Brexit.

To increase the visibility of young talent in the pandemic, the British Fashion Council, which represents the industry, has partnered with the social media giant TikTok.

The umbrella organisation has also joined forces with Clearpay, a group allowing customers to ""buy now pay later"" to boost sales.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Feb 18, 2021","ANDAM, the French national association for the development of the arts and fashion, has adopted an eclectic approach in selecting the jury for its 2021 emerging designer competition. This year, the permanent jury, composed of 19 members representing the competition’s main sponsors, will be complemented by 14 personalities drawn from a multiplicity of countries and artistic spheres, including photography, music and cinema.
 The ANDAM competition, now in its 32nd edition, was founded in 1989 by Nathalie Dufour to help emerging designers, under the auspices of France’s Culture and Communication Ministry and of Defi (the country’s Committee for the Development and Promotion of Apparel). The competition’s jury has never featured so many personalities from other fields, as opposed to the industry professionals and fashion insiders it customarily includes, as this year.

Of course, among this year’s 14 guest judges, there are many well-known fashion names. Like the former creative director of Céline, English designer Phoebe Philo, and Kerby Jean-Raymond, the designer who founded New York label Pyer Moss. Also part of the jury are fashion consultants Linda Loppa and Marie Chaix, journalists Suzanne Koller of M le Monde and Chioma Nnadi of vogue.com, critic Pierre M’Pelé, known as Pam Boy on social media, the founder of Net-A-Porter, Natalie Massenet, and Sally Singer, the head of fashion direction at Amazon Fashion.Alongside them, composer, illustrator and actress Lou Doillon, Chinese singer Chris Lee, Thai rapper Lalisa Manoban, the vocalist and dancer of South Korean group Blackpink, and partners Juergen Teller, a photographer, and Dovile Drizyte, an art director.
 
There are also a few changes of note in the permanent jury: René Célestin, Xavier Clergerie, Thierry Guibert and Nadja Swarovski have left, replaced by the CEO of Balenciaga Cédric Charbit (appointed jury president and mentor of the future grand prize winner), the General Manager of WSN Frédéric Maus, the Creative Director of Swarovski, Giovanna Engelbert, and by Catherine Spindler, EVP branding and marketing at Lacoste.
 
Also part of the jury are Nathalie Dufour, founder of ANDAM, and Guillaume Houzé, image and communication director of the Galeries Lafayette group, the competition’s chairman since 2018. Because of the pandemic, most of the selection process will be carried out remotely and online.

ANDAM issued a call for applications in early February, and has raised the total prize money from €450,000 to €500,000. The deadline for submitting applications is April 27, and the finalists’ shortlist will be announced at the end of May. The competition's winners will be revealed by the jury on July 1 2021.

"Feb 18, 2021","McArthurGlen Designer Outlet West Midlands has announced some major new names with Coach, Kate Spade, Hugo Boss, Levi’s and Lacoste having signed up for the opening this spring.They’ll be joined by Gant and Radley, while Under Armour and Nike will complete a line-up of sportswear and athleisure brands.

The £160 million outlet is just 30 minutes from Birmingham and has already announced a raft of brands, including Tommy Hilfiger, Guess, Calvin Klein, Ted Baker, Reiss, Kurt Geiger, Adidas, Asics, Skechers and Joules.It’s a strong group of fashion names that will also be joined by a dining offer set to include Wagamama, Starbucks and Five Guys. And to boost the ‘day out’ appeal of the location further, there will be a “one-of-a-kind children’s play area, a dancing fountain”, plus bicycle parking, electric car charging points, beehives, and direct access to the adjacent nature reserve and its network of footpaths.

The centre will host up to 80 brands in its opening phase. When its second phase is complete, it will cover 285,000 sq ft and will create around 1,000 new retail jobs.

It’s the only standalone shopping centre currently set to open this year in Britain and comes 25 years after the group opened its first European site with a Cheshire Oaks, UK debut. It’s actually the company’s first UK opening in more than 20 years and will be the group’s 26th centre across Europe and Canada.

"Feb 16, 2021","Dinners with friends and nights out inspired Badgley Mischka’s fall 2021 line presented at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday, with the American label presenting an array of shiny dresses for when fashionistas will be able to socialise freely again.Designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka shared a video of their “return to wonderful” collection, filmed at one of their favourite New York restaurants, as part of the event, which is mostly virtual this season because of COVID-19 restrictions.

With the pandemic curbing travel, the duo said they looked back on past good times out in New York, hopeful for a return to these soon.“It allowed us to go back and think about how fabulous and how fantastic New York night life was - restaurants, theatre, nightclubs and think about how great that was and how great it’s going to be again,” Badgley told Reuters.

“So we designed this collection for after COVID times or during COVID vaccination times for the fall when it’s all coming true and we think it will and how fantastic New York can be again.”

Filmed earlier this month, the video showed models dressed in black and white trouser suits, black and midnight blue velvet evening gowns adorned with huge bows, shimmering metallic fringed dresses and golden and bronze satin pyjama outfits.

Long belted gowns in butterscotch and blush added dabs of colour.

The designers said they chose to shoot the video at Keens Steakhouse to support restaurants during the pandemic.

“We realised when our collection ships in the fall, hopefully thank God, it will be a time when we’ll return to some sort of normal,” Mischka said.

“It will be a very different time when women will be able to go out, congregate, celebrate and feel good about getting together, looking amazing and having a good time for a change.”

Most brands are sharing videos of their autumn/winter 2021-2022 collections at a virtual New York Fashion Week: The Shows, with very few live socially-distanced catwalk presentations.

“We realised we had to work a little earlier than usual because just shipping around the world is so difficult with COVID restrictions and the weird weather we’re having everywhere so we had to plan out a little more ahead of time,” Badgley said.

"Feb 16, 2021","If any fashion house has got its act together deep into this pandemic, it has to be Anna Sui, who unveiled another swish, upbeat collection and charming video on Tuesday morning, the halfway point of New York Fashion Week. 
A collection that looked forward to better times by harnessing the optimism of 1960s, in particular Joe Massot’s cult flick Wonderwall, which stars Jane Birkin as a pop-art femme fatale (named Penny Lane) and Jack MacGowran, Samuel Beckett’s favorite actor, as a mad professor obsessed with her beauty.
 
Pretty prairie dresses; astutely chosen pop-paisley frocks and great picnic dresses worn with matching print tights. All with a touch of wackiness and whimsy that one associates with Sui – from the daffy faux big-cat-print faux-fur coat and matching hat to the brilliant psychedelic Navajo blanket coats.The cast dancing before a fab circus-fair backdrop of stars and planets, painted by Sarah Oliphant, to the tune  of George Harrison’s sitar-soaked Flower Power pop soundtrack.
 
When it gets dark, Sui’s sirens hitting the clubs in micro-sequin pantsuits or flirty lace dresses, finished with river boat gambler string ties.
 
“As we wait 'on pause' for the new world that will emerge from this pandemic, my mind is awhirl with visions of the vibrant world that lies just ahead – I can’t stop thinking of that “black-and-white to color” moment. The limbo that we are living in will turn psychedelic, exuberant with color and pattern—it’s going to be Phantasmadelic!” thrilled Sui in her program notes.
 
Aided by an excellent cast of a quintet of junior veterans – Hanne Gaby Odiele, Lara Park, Issa Lish, Dilone and the perfectly pouty Cristina Piccone – all perfectly made up by Pat McGrath.
 
Sui had easily one of the best collections and videos in last season’s largely virtual New York fashion season back in September. She just had another one in the current fashion week.

"Feb 16, 2021","No one could fault the latest crop of designer showing, in New York, for effort. In a busy Monday, the first full day of New York Fashion Week, with almost 30 collections, their arty videos and polished ideas were a welcome reminder of how hard many talented people have been working during the endless pandemic.
 
A day that was much an ode to New York; to designer pride in living in the city and to respect for the very dreams that attracted people to the metropolis, as it was to fashion. With one key message - the explosion in volume, with body-conscious clothing banished, and not a skinny jean in sight.
 A. Potts Nowhere was volume so evident than at A. Potts, by Aaron Potts, a son of Detroit from a working class family from the south. A Parsons School graduate, who has managed to pack in stints with Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Emanuel Ungaro and Victoria’s Secret.
 
If his resume is eclectic, his mini show video was focused; with a cast of handsome dancers emoting proudly inside a 14th Street loft. Majestic priestly cloaks; giant blotched check mohair coats; massive loon pants and oversized judo jackets. Made in great hues of bitter yellow, muddy orange and brownish anthracite. Somehow doing exactly what fashion is meant to do; making some sense of our collectively nervous moment by virtue of the exaggerated forms of these clothes.
 Chelsea GraysThe day’s most arresting collection was 'Homage 2020' by Chelsea Grays, an American who lives in Paris and designs menswear. Seen on a dashing gang of hipsters marching about the city, the clothes were a mashup of abstract expressionist splotch print shirts and tops; funky kilts; asymmetrical men’s skorts; chopped up tweed hacking jackets; patchwork hobo dresses and dense check jodhpurs. One needs chutzpah and nerve to wear these clothes, but isn’t everyone in New York blessed with those two traits?
 ChochengOne brand that looks like it knows what it is doing is Chocheng, by designer Cho Cho Cheng, whose video captured what’s best about this designer: plausible, pristine and rather posh ensembles in well-chosen colors and fabrics.
 
Flared lapel coats; ruffle-topped blouses; accordion pleat finishes to blouses and calico frocks; snugly cut professional blazers. Anchored by lots of accomplished tailoring, underlining how much Cheng had picked up in her apprenticeship in Savile Row, after studies at Parsons School of Design.
 
Finished with coolie hats or inverted lampshades toppers and made in lots of red; happily more sinful Valentino that Chinese New Year. 
 
Red-cheeked models with chignons, mainly of Asia origin, marching around a fab Gene Kelly musical worthy set, to spacey synth music. Nothing terrible revolutionary, but nonetheless a highly composed and coherent collection.
 Victor LiThe best thing about this co-ed collection were the great fabrics. Wonderful composite prints of Western heroes; hyper-sized Yankee dollar-bill looks; vintage postcard imagery in classy blazers; perfectly acid-dyed jeans; graphic photo-montage perforated jerkins.
 
Even the jagged checks used in boyfriend’s overcoats were excellent. All shown in barely two minutes. In a word, a bravura display from yet another Parson School graduate. And, a lesson that less is more in a video can be perfect for more is more materials.
 Private PolicyBy any standards this was an obtuse way to make a point. The actual collection by Private Policy was made up of lots of oversized tailoring and sportswear – referencing Balenciaga shapes without any of the power and panache.
 
The show blurb, however, explained that this was meant to be about the “hidden history” of 1800s Chinese transcontinental railroad workers and acknowledging the xenophobic feelings of the era.
 
The collection was actually entitled 'We Remember You, Tales of Ghost Mountain'. But, there was precious little of that idea in the actual video. Mainly composed of giddy models pirouetting around New York lofts and streets. 
 Snow Xue GaoMoody momenta in empty studios with high-rise views of old office buildings, were an odd choice of backdrop for this rather saccharine selection of fashion, and awkwardly complicated undergraduate tailoring.
 AdeamA purist vision of romantic fashion from Adeam, by designer Hanako Maeda of Japan. From courtly dresses with leg of mutton sleeves; to artfully cut-out shirts in men’s materials. Inspired by an exhibition of six contemporary Japanese artists in the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo.
 
Showed in an airy space to a wonderful, big ballad soundtrack.  An insouciant use of volume and primary colors worn on a cast that clearly loved the clothes. Flattering fashion and all the better for it by Maeda; truly a new star to add to the great tradition of modernist Japanese fashion.
 Carter YoungThe designer Carter Altman’s recollection of his family trips to enjoy bagels in Zabars in his youth – told nostalgically by Interpol’s Paul Banks – captured the spirit of this collection from the Carter Young brand of subtle tailoring, with the two key looks a micro corduroy jacket in an oversized cord and a piped gunner’s jacket. Simple yet effective like his touching black and white video, as much a paean to the dreams that lure youth to New York as to fashion itself.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 15, 2021","The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode has added 11 brands to its March schedule, three of them scheduled to stage shows, in the latest sign of vibrancy in Paris Fashion Week. 
The Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Féminine, the division of the federation that controls the official calendar of the women’s ready-to-wear season in Paris, the most influential in the world, has approved the addition of Jil Sander; and two Japanese houses – Takahiromiyashita The Soloist and Ujoh.
 
All told, the federation currently expects 93 houses to participate in the season, due to take place from March 1 to 9, “in the form of digital events essentially,” the organization said in a release Monday.Three other houses – Nicolas Lecourt Mansion, Maison Rabih Kayrouz and Paul Smith – will all return to the official calendar after a brief hiatus.
 
“For the first time, the Institut Français de la Mode (IFM) Master of Arts Graduate show enters into the Official Calendar and will open it,” noted the federation, which oversees the IFM, the Paris-based fashion design and luxury management school.
 
The eight additional fashion houses which have been accepted onto the tightly controlled calendar to give officially sanctioned presentations are Auralee and Wataru Tominaga of Japan; Benjamin Benmoyal and Weinsanto of France; and Di Petsa, Heliot Emil, Lourdes and Ninamounah from, respectively, UK, Denmark, USA and Netherlands.
 
The federation is due to put the latest Paris catwalk schedule online later today.

"Feb 15, 2021","Jason Wu opened this month’s New York Fashion Week on the Sunday night of Valentine’s Day, with a nostalgic ode to Coca Cola capitalism.
 
While Imitation of Christ duo, Tara Subkoff and Matthew Damhave, followed Wu up with a call for whimsy and sublimity, inspired in part by the loss of one of Subkoff’s friends to Covid-19. 
Wu explained that he was “feeling nostalgic” about his New England schooldays, and the “very idyllic Americana of those years.”
 
Though he actually harked further back to the 1950s, playing on the idea of the real-life general store. His set for his live, yet private, show included baskets of flower and plywood crates of tomatoes, leeks and pumpkins.Wu will be one the few shows with actual live models in this week’s New York season; the vast majority of whose events are digital presentations or fashion videos. The three-and-a-half-day season includes some 60 brands, and climaxes Wednesday night with Tom Ford. However, New York is bereft of shows, or even videos, by a half-dozen of its greatest fashion houses including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs.
 
For the season’s opener, Wu’s cast dressed demurely, their hair pulled back in ladylike chignons, as Wu respected his own inner city cosmopolitan DNA.
 
As he explained last season, during the pandemic he’s been cooking his mother’s recipes and “finding new ways to be expressive.” And, thanks to Chef’s Warehouse, Wu was able to fill his show with the finest ingredients, which charity City Harvest could then pass on to help New Yorkers most in need.
 
Wu also played on the most ubiquitous expression of American soft-power capitalism – Coca Cola. After being given free rein to their archives, but not - one imagines - to their secret formula, weaving in iconic Coca Cola bottles into prints, notably in a dense multi-logo silk frock in candy apple red; or a black and white bottle print seen in a plissé skirt. Part of a series of international Coca Cola logos in various languages. 
“These logos bring that multicultural aspect to the collection and a nod to what America means to me – a melting pot of diverse cultures,” said Wu. He took his bow dressed in all black – jeans, top coat, mask and hoodie featuring the Coca Cola logo in Chinese.
 
What also worked well were the great, almost painterly knits; and the perfectly judged jackets, as Wu honed his craft in the lockdown. His goal, he said, was to “create a collection of elevated American sportswear, handcrafted artisanal details with an emphasis on outerwear.”

Wu has always cut a great coats; and again added a sense of majesty with long, mannish topcoats with extra hand stitched detailing. Better yet a matelassé Canadian trapper look with black torso and plaid sleeves.
 
Adding in metallic earrings and pendants in autumnal leaf shapes was also a neat touch; as was using the same shapes in art gallery opening frocks.
 
Later in the evening, Imitation of Christ, or IoC as they are often known, played on whimsicality via drum majorette tops paired with baggy pants; colonial military jackets seen over crushed golden silk bras; tie-dye t-shirts with lace sheathes worn by men with hairy legs and off-beat screen goddess gowns with eccentric lacing.
 
Circus performers at a downtown after, after-party, or better yet -- in search of one of IoC’s much missed performance art runway happenings. May that return soon.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 15, 2021","Tadashi Shoji looked to armor-inspired metallics and embellishments for his autumn/winter 2021 designs on Sunday, presenting an array of shiny elaborate dresses on the first day of a virtual New York Fashion Week.

In a pre-recorded video, the American designer, known for his evening gowns, unveiled silhouette-hugging frocks adorned with fringed sleeves, puffed shoulders, paillettes or lace detailing.Models stood against a fire-lit sky and on top of a pile of old furniture - including a piano, chandelier and bed frame - in the video, with smoke sometime billowing from underneath.

With COVID-19 restrictions cancelling the usual bustling catwalk shows, designers have had to rethink how they present collections.The Feb. 14-18 New York Fashion Week: The Shows is a mainly virtual event, with most brands sharing videos of their latest designs and only very few hosting socially distanced live presentations.

“The past year has challenged us in ways we could never have imagined. No one has escaped unaffected. We yearn for security. We are forced to summon our strength every day,” Shoji said in show notes.

“This season, I wanted to design pieces that inspire a sense of protection, a collection that reflects our strength - a strength so palpable you could rap your knuckles on it, and it would sound like steel.”

There were velvet dresses adorned in floral designs, as well as a black trouser suit and velvet jumpsuit.

Evening gowns were draped, had sparkly embellishments or came off the shoulder. There was also a small selection of jacquard ball gowns.

Shoji choose a mainly bronze, dark brown, red, orange, steel and midnight blue palette.

"Feb 12, 2021","Fashionistas will be turning to their screens to see the latest designer trends this fashion week as the traditional autumn/winter catwalk calendar kicks off virtually in New York on Sunday.With COVID-19 restrictions in place, the usual celebrity-packed front rows, snapping street photographers and exclusive parties are gone, replaced with virtual or, in a very few cases, socially distanced shows.

Designers will show more than 100 “pieces of content” from their autumn/winter 2021-2022 collections in a film, live event or lookbook, said IMG, which runs New York Fashion Week: The Shows.“There’s a lot of hope coming out of this year and the past month with the momentum of (the U.S. presidential) inauguration and the vaccine,” said April Guidone, global senior vice president for marketing and brand strategy at IMG, in an interview.

“I think everyone has a hopeful outlook for the rest of the year but also excited to be able to show in any form that they can in creative ways.”

Brands such as The Blonds and Badgley Mischka will share video streams while big names Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren are absent from the show schedule. The few live events include shows by designers Jason Wu and Rebecca Minkoff, Guidone said.

“We’ve been working very closely with the governor and health officials to make sure that our protocols are in place,” she said, adding a new fashion week podcast would also debut.

Earlier this month the Council of Fashion Designers of America unveiled its American Collections Calendar, a renamed and expanded New York Fashion Week, with added presentations from U.S. designers showing at later dates.

The fashion and luxury goods industry has been hit hard by the global pandemic with store closures and travel restrictions shrinking demand.

Worldwide personal luxury goods sales fell 23% to 217 billion euros ($262.42 billion) in 2020, the first drop since 2009, according to consultancy Bain.

“It’s been a tough time for everyone in the business. Fashion is all about looking good, and if no one is really looking at you there’s not much point. ... Spiritually it’s a very difficult moment,” said Godfrey Deeny, global editor-in-chief of FashionNetwork.com.

“A number of younger designers sadly will go through the wall, but in a curious way the fact the season went digital helped a few of them because it’s cheaper somehow to shoot video in a studio or out in the street rather than stage a runway show.”

"Feb 12, 2021","Opening Ceremony may have closed down its destination boutique in Soho last spring, but the brand is very much alive and kicking, as the latest collection from its founders – Carol Lim and Humberto Leon - clearly trumpets.
 
Though living through a 'Continental Divide', Leon in LA, and Carol in Brooklyn, have conjured up a clever new fashion statement – part reference to found home materials (even from mattresses) –  during the pandemic; part expression of their artistic collab’ with a wallpaper company. 
After seven years as creative directors at Kenzo, where they enjoyed a steady learning curve, from retailers to designers, their cut, line and silhouette all show great assurance. Working 3,000 miles or more apart, their newest collection manages to combine West Coast psychedelic and downtown New York cool. 
 
These fall-winter looks mark the second collection the duo created since Italy’s New Guards Group – owners of the license to Off/White and of Country of Milan, among other brands – acquired Opening Ceremony. So, it’s been a busy few months for the duo, especially for Leon, who also managed to open up a family restaurant in LA, in between designing clothes for this fall. 
 
While at Kenzo and at Opening Ceremony, the duo increasingly stretched the definition of a runway show, intersecting art movies, dance performance and theatre into their events. From the ballet stage of Lincoln Center to the brutalist modernism of a Paris college. This season, the duo only produced a look-book shot in Italy, but are clearly keen to extend the definition of a catwalk show this fall, hopefully when the global lockdown lifts.

So we caught up with the pair for a transatlantic and transcontinental zoom with Humberto and Carol to learn about all that’s new at Opening Ceremony.
 
Fashion Network: How are things going with your new partners New Guards?
Umberto Leon: Amazing. We think New Guards are production wizards and really know how to take care of brands. Our collections are now 100% made in Italy, which is super fun and nice.
 
FN: Where are you producing in Italy?
Carol Lim: Near Venice. We did manage to visit our factories in Italy quite a bit before the pandemic, but we were banned after that! Most of it is made half an hour from Venice in a gorgeous area of fine wines, which we like!FN: How do you manage to create while living in different cities?
CL: Well, it’s been a new process in general, due to Covid. But, we have shorthand and vibe on the phone and understand each other quickly.

HL: But, in a way, it’s not that different. We have a very natural process. Lots of shipments going back and forth; seeing what fabrics are, and if and how looks work. So, it’s been pretty seamless. Plus, we had a crash course doing Kenzo on different countries, so we had our version of this before.
 
FN: How is your movie career going?
HL: Well… I might be in negotiations. We have always found different ways to show fashion, and never wanted to follow the classic fashion calendars or ways. We always based our shows on culture away from the catwalk. In the end, everyone will talk about clothes anyway. We made dance performances before that became a thing. This season we did do a little video to accompany the collection, but more as an insert for business and press.

CL: But we will look at experimenting again. We are not forced to have an event, that doesn’t make sense; more a humanistic approach.
 
FN: Where did you shoot the look-book?
HL: Actually, at the B&B Italian factory in Lombardy, who work with Mario Bellini, whose Camaleonda sofa at home inspired part of the collection. 
FN: What was the inspiration of this collection?
HL: We wanted to talk about the moment we are living in. We were stuck in our homes and so used everything around us to make a collection. We took fitted sheets and draped them, but then made the result in leather with elastic. We began taking apart comforters to remake as jackets. 

CL: It was about taking things and not making them look like they seem. Plus, coming out of the pandemic we wanted to have fun, as these clothes come out in September.

HL: Our key Heartwood print is from the wallpaper print company Calico, which works with people like Daniel Arsham or Snarkitecture. We have a new artistic collaboration with them. And we worked with illustrator Bráulio Amado, who creates artwork for Róisín Murphy, whom we love. He helped us make new logos coming from mattresses. 
 
FN: When can we visit your restaurant?
HL: You can already. It opened six weeks ago. It’s called called Chifa, and located in Eagle Rock, in LA. I planned to open his place two years ago with my family. I thought I would just do the interiors and the uniforms. But when the pandemic happened I was in LA, so I ended up designing the restaurant space. In fact, the Calico Heartwood print is the wallpaper in the restaurant.
 
FN: What happened to your original boutique?
CL: We closed down the store in March last year, but due to Covid we didn’t get to celebrate that history. 

HL: But we’ve had lots of discussion and retail will be involved in our next step. Online is obviously very important. It’s the beginning of a new chapter, when we bring back lots of our DNA.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Feb 10, 2021","The British Fashion Council has unveiled Australian buy-now-pay-later giant Clearpay as its new Principal Partner for London Fashion Week. It’s a two-year deal and starting with this month’s digital LFW, the partners will “champion British fashion, support the UK retail industry, and give consumers more access to the designers and brands they love”.The LFW websites now opens with the words ""London Fashion Week presented by Clearpay"".

Specifically, in 2021 Clearpay will work with the BFC “to integrate inclusive shoppable moments and dynamic interactive concepts — bringing the best of the British fashion industry to a wider group of consumers. Together, they will help ensure British designers continue to lead in innovation, creativity, accessibility and have the ability to build responsible and sustainable businesses”.The link between the BFC and Clearpay isn’t a new one and goes back two years. The Australian firm has been a patron and partner to the group in recent years and it contributed £25,000 to the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund for the Covid Crisis in 2020.

Neither the company nor the BFC would put a value on the new link-up, but the BFC said Clerapay will underwrite all of the group's talent support initiatives for 2021/22, including NewGen, the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Trust and the BFC/GQ Designer Menswear Fund.

The body contributes over £1 million to designers through the BFC Foundation each year and Clearpay is the first partner to support all of its initiatives in addition to London Fashion Week.

BFC CEO Caroline Rush said the new deal is part of the group continuing to develop London Fashion Week, “opening it up to a broader range of consumers and adapting it to the designers’ needs”.

Clearpay co-founder Nick Molnar added: “Through this partnership, we will continue to support British designers and the broader retail economy as we emerge from this terrible pandemic.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 9, 2021","PVH-owned brand Tommy Hilfiger has partnered with online learning platform, FutureLearn, to launch a portfolio of social impact educational courses. An extension of the brand's social and environmental efforts, as well as its spring 2021 'Moving Forward Together' campaign, the partnership will encompass five courses designed by Tommy Hilfiger. Courses will focus on sustainability, LGBTQIA+ allyship, body confidence and community building, each hosted by a famous activist. 

In a press release, the brand said the courses are designed to champion those often underrepresented in fashion, and each course involves a mixture of storytelling, engaging in dialogue, developing new social and environmental knowledge and celebrating progress.February 15 will mark the launch of the first class, featuring actress, podcaster, model, writer and body positivity activist, Jameela Jamil, discussing body neutrality and challenging body image stereotypes. Following classes will include exploring sustainable living and loving with multi-genre musician and sustainability activist, Mogli, on March 1; exploring intersectionality and what makes you unique with DJ, singer, songwriter, performer and activist, Kiddy Smile, on March 15; exploring mentorship and community change with horse-riding healing community and mentorship collective, Compton Cowboys, on March 29; and exploring LGBTQIA+ activism, advocacy and allyship with actor, model and activist, Indya Moore, during the summer of 2021.

All courses will be available for free on FutureLearn’s mobile-first platform. Each course takes four hours to complete and will be viewable indefinitely on futurelearn.com across mobile, tablet and computer devices. 

“We want to not only inspire but enable our fans to make a positive difference in their own lives and the lives of others,” said Tommy Hilfiger. 

“Creating free, meaningful courses through the FutureLearn platform is one way we are equipping them to do so. These socially driven, online classes teach material that isn’t always covered in schools but is so important today. To move forward together, we all need to learn more about ourselves, our communities and the planet, and that’s exactly what our courses teach.”

Justin Cooke, chief content and partnerships officer at FutureLearn, added: ""We’re delighted to announce our partnership with the iconic fashion powerhouse, Tommy Hilfiger. At FutureLearn, our mission is to transform access to education, which is why we’re especially proud to work with Tommy Hilfiger to deliver on this through a new and free set of courses on increasingly important societal topics. From sustainability to body neutrality, building community, LGBTQIA+ allyship and activism, and more, we hope that the diverse and inspiring range of voices at the heart of these conversations will bring a variety of new perspectives to the platform for our millions of learners to engage meaningfully with.” 

Coinciding with the courses, Tommy Hilfiger said it will be giving a series of live talks on its global social channels to provide additional ""short form, snackable life hacks."" 
 
In December, Tommy Hilfiger parent company PVH—also the parent company of Calvin Klein—announced an 18% decline in its third-quarter revenue, a significant sequential improvement compared to decreases in the last two quarters, which were heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 8, 2021","The British Fashion Council (BFC) has signed TikTok as Principal Partner of its returning talent identification scheme NewGen. At the same time, BNPL payment firm Clearpay will also become the event’s Official Partner.The event was shelved last year due to the Covid pandemic. Now the BFC and TikTok, the short-form mobile video giant, will work together to create a new “bespoke programme of activity” for all NewGen recipients. This will include streaming support of designer shows, mentoring, masterclasses and digital support for the recipients.

As we look towards the future, we are delighted to bring back NewGen for 2021/22 with the support of a new Principal Partner. 

She added: “The BFC always understood the changing nature of fashion and led the way in technology and innovation.

"Feb 6, 2021","Following the marathon of virtual menswear shows in January, the women's ready-to-wear fashion weeks are fast approaching. While London has announced an entirely digital calendar running from 19 to 23 February, Milan has joined New York (14-17 February) in planning the return of some 15 physical shows and presentations, including one from new brand Del Core, in the presence of a handful of buyers and journalists. The remaining brands will mainly present their collections via the digital platform launched by the Camera della Moda Italiana (CNMI), which will host 61 runway shows, 52 presentations and six events from 23 February to 1 March.  
""It's a very well structured calendar, with an interesting programme for each day. In total, we'll have 124 sessions, including, for the first time, a digital interview with Brunello Cucinelli. Furthermore, as in September, our platform will offer parallel events focused on themes that are important to us, such as sustainable development, diversity and inclusion,"" explained CNMI president Carlo Capasa during a video conference. He also reminded his audience that the fashion week's opening will feature a film directed by Beninamino Barrese, which pays hommage to Beppe Modenese, one of Capasa's illustrious predecessors as CNMI president and an avid promoter of Italian-made fashion. 

Excluding the notable absence of Versace, which announced on Thursday that it has opted to reveal its collection with a video to be launched on 5 March (which is to say after the end of the official calendar) all of the major Milan Fashion Week regulars are present and correct. This includes Valentino, which has confirmed its participation in the Milanese event for the second season in a row, following years of shows in Paris. It's a tightly packed programme then, and one which looks to be full of highlights. Starting with Fendi, which will reveal the first women's ready-to-wear collection by Kim Jones on the fashion week's opening day. Another first collection to keep an eye on is that set to be presented by Alessandro Dell'Acqua for Elena Mirò, a brand which is making its big comeback to the Milanese calendar after a ten-year absence. 

The Neapolitan designer will also be appearing on the Fall/Winter 2021-22 programme with his own label, N°21, on 24 February, alongside Missoni. The schedule for the next day (Thursday, 25 February) features brands such as Max Mara, Prada and Moschino, while Friday, 26 February will see shows from Antonio Marras, Etro and Tod's. On Saturday, 27 February, it's the turn of Giorgio Armani and Salvatore Ferragamo. Sunday's highlights will include Dsquared2, Fila and Emilio Pucci, while Ports1961, MSGM, Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana will round the week off on 1 March. Both Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana are currently evaluating the possibility of organising a physical show. 
 
Aside from Brunello Cucinelli and Alessandro Dell'Acqua x Elena Mirò, another notable debut comes from brand-new label Del Core, launched by Daniel Del Core, a long-time collaborator at Gucci, who will be organising a physical show. But there's also the new brand from Alessandro Vigilante, who trained at Dolce & Gabanna, Gucci and Philosophy, not to mention Christian Boaro's label, CHB, which the designer – who boasts extensive experience, having previously worked at Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Ferré and MSGM – launched in the middle of lockdown. And let's not forget the arrival of Giuseppe Buccinnà, a trained engineer and promising Italian talent, who founded his fashion house in 2015. Along with these new names, there will also be Onitsuka Tiger, the fashion-focused sister label of Japanese footwear brand Asics, and Korea's Münn, by Hyun-min Han, both of which will be making their Milanese debuts this season. Other first-timers on the womenswear calendar include Budapest Select, a collective show focused on fresh Hungarian design; Fabio Quaranta, a regular of the menswear season; and Dima Leu, the young Moldovan talent who showed in Milan for the first time last month, during men's fashion week.
  
The CNMI also has plans to organise a number of parallel projects, with a particular focus on supporting young design. This includes ""We are made in Italy - The Fab Five Bridge Builders,"" a video project made by designers of colour in collaboration with the Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion collective, which will open the Italian fashion week on the morning of 24 February. 

Similarly to last September, 11 young designers – Marco Rambaldi, Fantabody, Vitelli, Gentile Catone,  Themoirè, Drome, Simona Marziali, Mrz, Melampo, Sara Battaglia, Giannico and Greta Boldini – will also have their pieces featured at a pop-up hosted by Italian department store Rinascente during the fashion week. Elsewhere, the second season of the ""Designer for the Planet"" project will highlight collections produced by designers engaged in sustainable fashion, such as Gentile Catone, Gin Salemò, Froy;Traffico, Iindaco, and Dassùyamoroso. 

Finally, for the first time, Milan Fashion Week will shine a spotlight on the work of craftsmen, presenting five different Italian artisans: plumassier Duccio Mazzanti, weaver Alberto Bevilacqua, bespoke shoemaker Vivian Saskia Wittmer, knitwear specialist Marina Rizzini, and fabric flower artist Anna Tosi.

"Feb 5, 2021","Five designers from the Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion collective will kick off, with their Fall/Winter 2021-22 collections, the next Milan Fashion Week Women. The Milanese event is scheduled from Feb. 23 to March 1, and will be mostly staged virtually due to the pandemic. The collective's project was launched at the last Milan Fashion Week, in September, when it was relegated to the tail end of the calendar. Instead, this season it will be the first item on the show programme - set to start on Feb. 24 - right after the tribute to Beppe Modenese, the former president of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) who passed away last November.“It’s extraordinary, it’s a very strong signal the Italian Fashion Chamber is broadcasting. It will be us setting the tone,” said to AFP on Thursday Michelle Ngonmo, co-founder of the collective alongside designers Stella Jean and Edward Buchanan. However, “it took quite a fight” before the collective was able to “overcome the CNMI’s hesitation in facilitating our access to the [Milan] Fashion Week. Now, CNMI is willing to listen to us,” added Ngonmo.

The same five designers who presented their collections in September will be showing this season. They are Joy Ijeoma Meribe from Cameroon, with her Modaf Designs label; Karim Daoudi from Morocco; Nigeria-born Claudia Gisèle Ntsama, with her Gisfab label; Fabiola Manirakiza from Burundi, founder of the Frida-Kiza label; and from Senegal, Pape Mocodou Fall, a.k.a. Mokodu, as his label is known. As they did in September, they will showcase their creations with a video entitled ‘We are made in Italy - The Fab Five Bridge Builders’.In Italy, there are 450 fashion designers of African origin, who “are feeling discriminated because of the colour of their skin, so that many of them have emigrated to London, Paris or Beijing,” said Ngonmo. In 2015, Cameroon-born activist Ngomno founded the Afro Fashion Week, held in Milan once a year. “For five years, we crashed against a wall of silence when we knocked on the CNMI’s door, but now we are an integral part of [the Chamber], without losing our identity,” she said. “Ours are made-in-Italy labels, we manufacture in Italy, not in Africa,” underlined Ngonmo.

CNMI is helping immigrant designers who are living in Italy “to produce their collections in these difficult times,” emphasised Carlo Capasa, the CNMI’s president, talking to the press. CNMI part-funds these collections and puts the designers in contact with apparel and footwear producers willing to offer them discounts.

"Feb 5, 2021","The Zalando Sustainability Award 2021 has been awarded to House of Dagmar, Copenhagen Fashion Week announced. The luxury womenswear brand has been praised for its sustainable approaches undertaken at numerous levels of its design and manufacturing process.Launched in 2005, House of Dagmar positioned itself very early on with its choice of high quality materials, intended to give its garments an extended lifespan. The Swedish brand continued with this philosophy by launching garments including jackets and raincoats made of plastic from recycled bottles in 2014 and exclusively utilising organic cotton and denim from 2016. Last year, the brand began to track the impact of its products via The European Clothing Action Plan (ECAP) and found that its products were 25% sustainable, a figure which would have reached 90% in 2020.
 
“We are so excited to receive recognition for our efforts and be given the spotlight on the matters of sustainability - this is what we have been doing for more than 15 years now,” said brand director Sofia Wallenstam. “As fashion and sustainability is not a game or a sport where only one brand can win, we feel we want to share this recognition with so many of our very ambitious industry colleagues. We in team House of Dagmar are accepting this award with a humble mind. As a team we are truly doing our very best on the matter, but we still have a very long way to go to achieve our own goals. This gives us a push to keep putting even higher targets.”The jury for the occasion was composed of model and environmental activist Arizona Muse; CEO of Copenhagen Fashion Week Cecilie Thorsmark; CSO of Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), Morten Lehman; Sustainability and brand advisor, Dio Kurazawa; Director of Sustainability at Zalando, Kate Heiny; and Buying Director Premium and Luxury at Zalando, Lena-Sophie Roeper. 
In addition to financial support, the prize also awards House of Dagmar a partnership with Zalando which will see it develop an exclusive collection incorporating the CSR commitments of the business. Zalando also announced that it will retail a large selection of the collection showcased via video at Copenhagen Fashion Week on its portal.

"Feb 5, 2021","The CFDA has unveiled its calendar for this month’s New York Fashion Week, with a grand total of 84 brands listed, albeit some of them expected to show as far away as France.Due to the pandemic, the main season will take place over just four days – from Feb. 14 to 17, with 72 brands. Though the CFDA, or Council of Fashion Designers of America, also lists a further 12 brands – including such notables as Gabriela Hearst, Carolina Herrera, Thom Browne and Coach – with digital presentations stretching through to April 15.

Browne, for instance, has staged his men’s and women’s ready-to-wear shows in Paris for the past half decade. While Hearst presented her most recent collection inside the Beaux-Arts college in Paris in September.The main New York season itself will open on Sunday evening, Feb. 14 with just two shows – Jason Wu and the downtown avant-garde indie marque Imitation of Christ. And will climax Wednesday evening, with Tom Ford, whose eponymous designer is also the chairman of the CFDA.

Underlining the growing fragmentation of the New York season, the four largest American fashion houses -  Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Michael Kors – are not listed on the CFDA schedule. The sheer number of designers and show days has also fallen precipitously, from some 170 shows over eight days as little as two years ago.“While the CFDA will continue to encourage American designers to show in New York during New York Fashion Week, we recognize the need for some to broaden their global visibility. In the past few years, many of our members have chosen to show in Europe, Asia, and other key markets and in many cases off-calendar. The events of the past year have only highlighted the need for flexibility within the fashion system,” said Ford in open letter on the CFDA’s own website.

“Wherever or however American designers choose to show their collections, it is our job as the CFDA to honor our original mission statement and to help promote and support American fashion. Therefore, we will publish on the schedule not only the schedule of designers showing in New York during New York Fashion Week but also those of American designers showing off-calendar and abroad,” he continued.

Ford himself has led this fashion caravanserai, going as far as to stage one of his shows in Los Angeles, in the midst of the New York runway season.

In another switch, the CFDA renamed the New York season as the American Collections Calendar in recognition of the increasingly peripatetic tendencies of New York-based designers. The season will be essentially a digital affair, and all the designers on the calendar will show their videos or phygital events on Runway360, the state-of-the-art CFDA website featuring menswear, womenswear, emerging talent, bridal and even accessories.This new American Collections Calendar also includes a two-hour lunchtime window on Monday, Feb. 15, devoted to menswear designers including Timo Weiland, Koh T, Carter Young and Chelsea Grays.

“The chief mission statement of the CFDA since its inception in 1962 has been to promote American fashion both domestically and abroad. Now more than ever this is one of our primary goals. The world has changed dramatically since 1962 and achieving global brand recognition is key in securing success for American designers. To that end, the show schedule that is released by the CFDA each season will be renamed the “American Collections Calendar.” We will include all American designers within the calendar and on Runway360, regardless of location or collection release date. This season, even more than last, will be a great challenge for all of us as the world grapples with an increasingly devastating pandemic and economic downturn. We at the CFDA are here to support you in any way that we can. Warmest Regards,”  concluded Ford in his missive.

May the season, virtually at least, begin.

"Feb 4, 2021","The house of Versace plans to skip the next Milan Fashion Week, and instead will unveil its next collection solely online during the runway season of Paris.The Medusa-head maison is also planning to unveil a new pattern in that collection to boost its bottom line, as its new owners, Capri Holding Ltd, attempt to build out Versace’s accessories business.

“Being a digital event has its advantages. One of them is the possibility of connecting with your audience whenever you think is the right moment,” said creative director Donatella Versace in a release on Thursday.The next Milan women’s ready-to-wear season is scheduled to run from Feb. 23 to March 1. The Paris catwalk season runs from March 1 to 9. Versace thus joins Gucci and Bottega Veneta among major Italian luxury houses that will also not be present during the upcoming Milan season. However, the designer underlined that Versace remains committed to keeping Milan as the base for future shows.

“The decision to present the Fall/Winter 21 collection a few days after the Milan Fashion Week doesn’t affect the fact that Versace remains a proud member of Camera della Moda and that the brand will always be a key player and a big supporter of the Italian fashion system. Fashion is an art and sometimes it has to work outside the usual path to fully blossom,” said Donatella.

The Camera, Italian fashion’s governing body, is due to release the show schedule for the February shows later today, Feb. 4.

The decision to unveil its Fall-Winter 2021 collection in a digital-only broadcast marks a new first in the brand’s history. Versace plans to live stream the event, which will be filmed behind closed doors to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its community. The show is also expected to unveil a pattern, as part of a drive to accelerate turnover at the Milanese marque, according to John Idol, the CEO of Capri Holdings, which also controls Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.

“I believe it is going to change the trajectory of the company significantly over the next 24 months,” Idol told analysts in a conference all this week. He stressed that Versace plans a major marketing campaign for when the new pattern hits stores and e-tailers.

Though widely acknowledged as one of the world’s great runway brands, Versace has historically lagged behind competitors like Gucci, Christian Dior or Burberry in terms of developing major businesses in handbags, shoes, belts or jewelry.

"Feb 2, 2021","The changes have not yet been officially announced, but this season's Shanghai Fashion Week, originally scheduled to take place from 25 March to 3 April, is reportedly being postponed and will most likely run from 6 to 13 April. It is a decision that the event's organisers have been pushed to make by the appearance of new cases of Covid-19 in Shanghai, particularly in the Chinese metropolis' Huangpu district, the central neighborhood which usually hosts the fashion week. 
Local authorities, which classified the area as a ""medium risk zone"" last week, are keen to reassure the population. ""For the moment, the epidemic is under control in the city. People will still be able to enjoy the Spring Festival next month,"" explains the Shanghai Municipal Government's website. But the fashion week's organisers have opted to take preemptive action and, according to various media outlets, have told participants that the event will be postponed by two weeks. 

Last year, with the city strongly affected by the pandemic, Shanghai's was the first fashion week to adopt a virtual format. The event was streamed exclusively on Tmall, the flagship platform of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. In October, the fashion week's 18th edition was held in its traditional format, with physical shows and events being attended by the public.Since the start of the year, China has announced more than 100 new cases of Covid-19. The coronavirus variant from the UK, which is considered to be more contagious, has been found in Beijing, among other locations.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

This year’s event will be the first to be presented virtually, due to worldwide Covid-19 restrictions.It also comes with a new advisory board, responsible for selecting the initial 24 FTA designer finalists, and a new judging panel.

The finalists are:With the shift to a digital format, the event will include a “special virtual reality FTA experience” that will sit alongside the Doha-based ceremony. This will feature a series of local “intimate events and experiences” to take place prior to the final winners’ announcement, with the participation of global FTA judges.The FTA said the event has become even more important as “current world events have highlighted the uncertain future that lies ahead for young creatives without the right ecosystems and support networks… There has also been an increased call for all industries to recognise the contributions of minorities”.

It said this has led the FTA to up its commitment to promoting the emerging talent of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region fashion designers across various womenswear categories.

"Jan 31, 2021","A Vermont schoolteacher whose homemade mittens went viral after Senator Bernie Sanders wore them at President Joe Biden's inauguration has found a manufacturer to fulfill the resulting thousands of orders for her cozy gloves.""I have amazing news! I'm partnering with Vermont Teddy Bear to make Bernie's Mittens for EVERYONE!!"" Jennifer Ellis tweeted Saturday, adding that some of the proceeds would benefit the Make a Wish Vermont charity.

""I knew there had to be a way to get them to you -- and I found it!!"" the second-grade teacher said.The 42-year-old had sent Sanders a pair of her mittens, made from repurposed wool sweaters and lined with fleece made from recycled plastic bottles, after he lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, as a consolation gift.

Last year, as Sanders was running again for president, Ellis learned that he was wearing the mittens -- ""people were calling them his oven mitts"" -- but had lent them to someone else.

Ellis said she was so touched that she sent Sanders another 10 pairs.

The senator's homely brown and beige mittens featured prominently in a photo from the January 20 inauguration showing Sanders sitting alone in a folding chair, bundled up and seemingly unimpressed with the pomp and circumstance.

The image by AFP photographer Brendan Smialowski became the first viral meme of the Biden era, with the apparently aloof Sanders superimposed on everything from ""Star Wars"" scenes to Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper.""

""Many, many of you have reached out looking to buy a pair of these awesome mittens. Sadly I don't really make them anymore. But I want to make sure that you get a pair,"" Ellis said in a video on the Vermont Teddy Bear Company website.

""Everybody who wants these mittens will get them,"" she said with the enthusiasm of, well, a second-grade teacher.

Ellis told AFP three days after the inauguration that she had received around 13,000 emails from people who want to buy her mittens.

""Not just one pair -- people want lots of them,"" she said.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

Set in the desert, the models all wore white, including lacy hoodies and pants. The traditional dishdasha robe worn by men across the Arab Gulf was featured, but revisited with a slit down the front.""The world around us is changing, so too are attitudes towards fashion, and nowhere more so than in the Middle East,"" said Mohammed Aqra, chief strategist at the Arab Fashion Council.

""Arab Fashion Week-Men's presents the breadth of menswear beyond formal attire and street wear and paves the way for men in the Middle East to embrace a more adventurous wardrobe,"" he added.

The council organised the event, which will be broadcast on YouTube for the three day duration, to showcase some 15 regional and international designers, including from France, Britain, Iran and Lebanon.

Also on show Thursday were ""Puro Teatro"" (pure theatre) creations by Spanish designer Arturo Obegero, including high-rise pants, tops with crinkly waists and others with huge bow ties hanging from the back.

The first day of the Arab men's fashion week also featured designs by Zardouz, including animal print shirts and pants, as well as others by Anomalous and Boyfriend The Brand.

"Jan 27, 2021","Is Charles de Vilmorin about to be the next big thing in French fashion? The omens seem propitious and judging from the collection video he showed Wednesday evening during Paris couture he certainly has the design chops. 
Barely 24 years old, de Vilmorin’s birthday is on Christmas day – another good omen. The designer burst into the fashion filament this fall when he was chosen for GucciFest, taking that mini festival of young designers by storm, with his Count Dracula reinvented video entitled Repugnamtam.
 
What also sets him doubly apart is that in an era where many creative directors boasting hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers can barely draw like potato diggers, de Vilmorin is a great illustrator. And he does have a coolly dark side, seen in GucciFest and in this collection he unveiled online Wednesday.Charles spray-painted his opening ideas in his latest video clip; where the models have the most marvelous makeup – canary-yellow faces; green eye shadow and blue lips; their heads topped with swatches of gros-grain ribbon and mini chandeliers.
 
Two acrobatic spirits lift a diaphanous black silk dress off his one beauty to reveal a phantasmagorical jacket and pinafore all printed with Charles’ dramatic drawings.
 
Shotgun in hand, the couturier briefly turns around to mock-shoot at two more ladies: one dressed in a fantastic floral gown, as if a Niki de Saint Phalle statue had suddenly come alive. The other like a latter-day Reine Margot in balloon frock then starts sewing thread into the pal’s flower-patterned fabric breast.
 
Young men appear in his quilted and hooded courtier’s jackets with dragon motifs or surreal butterflies. Charles even constructs a one-meter-long fan with a great sketch of a naked Grand Guignol dancer. 
“I like fantasy in my illustrations, my references are people like Tim Burton. I like in my work the idea that you don’t know if it’s a human or a demon,” says de Vilmorin, whose other influences include Klimt, Symbolist painter Odilon Redon and Picasso.
 
He recalls that a wall of rapid sketches done on newspapers or scrap paper by Picasso in his museum in the Marais, “really stunned me and that’s where my monsters came from.”
 
Got to hand it to de Vilmorin -- he has a singular vision. And a great sense of color. And a born sense of the theatrical, like having a Brazilian parrot fly into the video, in colors that appear in the collection.
 
Before ending his video posing – with red and gold face paint - before his cast of 14 beauties. Talk about A Star is Born.
 
It also doesn’t hurt that Charles is the spitting image of Yves Saint Laurent; make that a grandson of Yves given the age gap, a resemblance that does not irk de Vilmorin.
 
“People have been this saying for years. Especially when I wore leather jackets like him when I was a teenager. And I don’t terribly mind the likeness. It’s actually quite flattering. Looking like one of the true icons of fashion doesn’t seem like such a bad thing,” laughs the bespectacled de Vilmorin, over coffee two days before his show video.
 
Born in Saint Germain-en-Laye, and brought up in the provincial city of Compiègne, he originally wanted to be a theatre director – loving the mix of sounds, lights, costumes, and the attitude of people wearing them. He even wrote some early plays as a teenager. But had began starting to sketch at the age of five. 
His father was a financial director of a mass fashion brand, and explained to him the ropes of the industry and how a dream could be become a métier. Eventually entering the Chambre Syndicale school of fashion when he was 18.
 
“I was less interested in how to make a perfect seam, that experiment with volume,” he muses.
 
Apart from doing a one-week summer internship with Alber Elbaz’ Lanvin, upon leaving college he launched his own marque.
 
“It was not really planned. After doing my masters program I was meant to do six months’ work study, but when I finally got around to looking, all the houses had their interns. So with nothing planned, my folks said either find a job or come home. But by hazard a private collector bought most of my graduation collection, and he wears them with nonchalance. So I stayed in Paris,” recalls this soft-spoken yet self-assured young man.
 
He still has not staged a runway show, nor a presentation. But he did show in GucciFest. And now he is a bona fide Paris couturier. Meteoric is an understatement.
 
In short, his work recalls the energy and optimism of the Années Folles, the last time the West emerged from war and a huge pandemic known as the Spanish Flu.
 
“Launching myself into couture was never planned. But I loved the idea of artisanal, unique pieces,” says de Vilmorin, whose fashion heroes are all Anglo-Saxon – Galliano, McQueen and Jacobs.
 
Like those stars who rose from fashion bohemia, de Vilmorin doesn’t even have an apartment, and has been staying with friends in his favorite triangle – from Pigalle to Opera to the Marais.
 
“I like their idea of presenting clothes with a narrative. It makes everything more coherent. And I’d like the audience to find the video a little bubble of positivism and fantasy,” insists Charles, brushing one of his wavy locks of hair away from his face.
 
Just like Yves.

"Jan 27, 2021","Alber Elbaz debuted his brand new AZ Factory Tuesday evening in this week’s Paris haute couture season, marking a dynamic change in direction by one of fashion’s most influential designers.
 
The collection was instantly recognizable as the work of Elbaz, famed for his cocktail hour sophistication, superlative draping and ability to enhance feminine beauty with an exotic and artistic finish.
 However, where in his previous career at Lanvin his price point meant his ideas were only obtainable by an elite, this collection will reach a far wider demographic audience, while still containing the essential of Elbaz’s DNA.
 
Besides broadening his target audience, Elbaz also broke a few rules with his launch. Staging what he called “show fashion” - a mock variety TV show with mid-range price clothes. Unheard of in the buttoned-up world of uber expensive couture that has an audience of barely 2,000 rich ladies worldwide.Named AZ Factory after the first and last letters of his name, Elbaz’s project is an intensely personal voyage. It also marks a significant moment for his financial backer, Richemont, the giant luxury group based in Geneva.
 
Richemont is regarded as the ruler of hard luxury, whose stable of watch and jewelry brands – Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, IWC, Jaeger Le Coultre – dominate that sector. But many of its string of soft fashion houses – Chloé, Dunhill and Alaia – are seen as laudable marques yet loss-making also-rans.That may be about to change, given the fresh investment Richemont’s CEO and controlling shareholder Johann Rupert has authorized to carefully pour into Alaïa, and now AZ Factory. 
 
Judging by this collection, Richemont’s new soft power project is off to a good start.
 
Its key elements were “anatomical” little black dresses made in a variety of forms. Best were the knit dresses, sculpted with diverse levels of stretch across the torso. Some cut with one shoulder, finished with round gold buttons. Engineered dresses with ergonomic sleeves. 
 
For a little va va vroom, a deep gorge dress cut with bouffant shoulders and leg of mutton sleeves; or a perfectly judged cocktail with huge back bow. All told 11 pieces, rolled out every few weeks, fresh deliveries appearing in varying palettes of colors.
 
“But this is not a capsule collection as that reminds me of antibiotics!” quipped the Israeli designer.
 
All made in XX small to XXX extra large.
 
“I know too many women who go to the children’s department to buy dresses! This is a solutions orientated project,” stressed Elbaz. 
 
His other clever trick was placing zips on the front, just like they tend to be in easier men’s fashion. And when Alber did place the zip at the back it came with an elongated pull string. Or he took fishbone used in corsets and put them in the back for support. 
Happily, there is relatively little pain at the cash register prices vary from 230 euros to 1,200 euros.
 
“People ask me about synergies with Richemont, but we are the smallest company in their portfolio. So we can say we are only doing 11 dresses, and then only pajamas. A big brand has to fill a three-floor flagship. It is time not to be scared of change,” said Elbaz in a pre-show zoom with FashionNetwork.com.
 
He called evening looks 'Diamonds and Pearls', with black décolleté columns finished with crystal logo necklaces and dangling earrings; or multiple necklaces of oversized pearls.  His other key decision was dressing his cast in in a new elongated pointy toe pump shaped sneakers. He called this 'Sneaky Pumps'.
 
“It’s the same cook, but different ingredients in the kitchen,” he cracked.
 
The third key element was using high performance fabrics in taut, elongated sportswear dresses, where fit gals danced and exercised enthusiastically during the AZ Factory talk show, formatted like a Saturday afternoon Italian TV spectacle.
 
Attired in a black shirt and red bow-tie, Elbaz introduced the event in a witty monologue, winning a burst of applause when he referred to his “fabulous” start-up team of just staff of 24. 
 
“We are not disruptive; we are just what we think is right for today,” said Elbaz, sat at the desk of a megalomaniac TV host with sketches and swatches. 
 
Nonetheless, the roll-out is definitely novel - just two sources – Farfetch and Net-A-Porter. Before moving to big boutiques and department stores in a couple of months. And his price range is nearer to when his Lanvin did a collab’ with H&M.
 
His most novel notion was 'Switchwear' – hoodie and legging looks with embroidered logos, that can be altered by adding a duchesse satin skirt, duchesse tuxedo or loose sweaters made of recycled yarn of polyester. Ready-to-go fashion where women are dressed to go from zoom to yoga to restaurant. All made with molecular fabrics in micro filaments. 'Super Tech Chic' Elbaz termed it, allowing him to create bubble dresses that held their shape perfectly. 
“Haute couture stands for experimenting and individuality so I feel we are right to be in couture,” he argued.
 
His cutest visual pun was a series of fab 100% silk pajamas made out of cartoon characters, or images of generic movie stars hugging and kissing – all the things he missed in lockdown - by five artists he met on Instagram.
 
Super Tech to Super Chic, inspired by Alber noticing runners along the Seine were dressed in outfits made of micro fiber of nylon. Leading him to factories in Spain and Amsterdam to invent textured materials with couture finishes. Used in tuxedos or nylon bubble frocks – high-fashion in the most technical fabric ever. Eco-dyed active couture; all packaged in a new white box with his eyes in reading glasses logo.
 
Turing to the commercial side, Alber underlined: “Richemont really adopted me like no one else. So a big thanks to a really special man Johann Rupert. 
 
“We had a three-hour meeting in London and then Johan said, ‘we go.’ And here we are today. It was that simple. They are great partners. Total mutual respect,” enthused Elbaz, in his pre-show zoom about this London meeting in the summer of 2019.
 
Since then, he has been working in the top floor of the Ateliers Jean Nouvel, designed by the Cartier Foundation. 
 
His half-hour show was shot in a suburban Paris studio, opening with drone shots of backstage of AZ Factory, where the TV producer is played by actress, Amira Casar.A bank of fashionstas –like Anna Wintour, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Rick Owens, Suzy Menkes and Marc Jacobs – turned up to cheer his return. While his cast was a mix of new faces and veterans like Georgina Grenville.
 
“When this pandemic ends, I want to fly for 48 hours, cause I miss flying and eating cold plates on planes. But I don’t think that we will all be partying. In the 1920s after WW2 and the Spanish flu we had Les Années Folles, which had its center in Montparnasse where we are now. The years of Hemingway, Dali, Cocteau, Josephine Baker and Charlie Chaplin. Wow! And the birth of jazz, a music you play with no notes but with intuition and that’s the word we are aiming for, a world of love,” mused the creator.
 
“I wanted to approach fashion from a different perspective,” explained Alber, who in his interregnum after departing Lanvin, felt he needed to fall in love with fashion again.
 
“Boredom was a key part of creativity. So I went back to the past to imagine the future. And began giving master classes in New York, Italy and Asia. I wanted to learn from the next generation. Everyone told me my social media manager had to be 15 and my CEO 21! And this next generation is great. They don’t drink and they don’t eat junk food, but their brains are packed with info – who, what, when, and where. So, sometimes I wondered is there any room left to dream!”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 26, 2021","Donning chic neck-to-toe abayas, models saunter in high heels around a swimming pool in a glitter-filled fashion show staged in the unlikeliest of places: Saudi Arabia.Haute couture displays are rare in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom and have usually been restricted to women or avoided female models altogether -- one even displayed dresses dangling from drones.

But a private event in Riyadh last weekend -- which showcased a new collection of abayas, a billowy, figure-concealing robe -- opened up to a small but mixed-gender audience at a time when social restrictions are slowly being eased in the country.Draped in shimmering embellishments, half a dozen models, most of them Saudi or of Saudi origin, displayed the collection that sought to redefine the abaya as a stylish overcoat suitable not just for Muslims but for women everywhere.

""The stigma around the abaya and the hijab around the world -- I wanted to change that,"" said Saudi Princess Safia Hussein Guerras, a former model who designed the collection in collaboration with Belgian designer Christophe Beaufays.

""If I bring it to a level of chicness and acceptance... maybe our generation will (fully) embrace the abaya.""

While many see the abaya, which has been obligatory public wear for Saudi women for decades, as a symbol of chastity and piety, feminists generally view it as a symbol of oppression.

The dress code was once fanatically enforced in the kingdom by the now-defanged religious police.'Fashionable'In 2018, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has spearheaded a sweeping modernisation drive -- said during an interview with broadcaster CBS that the robe was not mandatory in Islam, hinting the dress code may be relaxed.

But while it was announced the following year that it was not obligatory for foreigners, Saudi women are still required to wear the garment in public.

In a brewing cultural rebellion, however, the once all-black garment is now repurposed in bright colours and many women leave their cloaks open at the front.

Despite the risk of riling arch-conservatives, a handful of bold Saudi women have taken the rebellion a step further -- they have stopped wearing the abaya.

But Princess Safia, 50, said she hoped to make the garment ""fashionable"", a crossover between tradition and modernity that blends Arab motifs and patterns with contemporary fabrics.

The designs would appeal to women from different cultures and religions who share views on ""modesty and elegance"", said Beaufays, who is based in the kingdom and works for Jeddah-based Lomar which designs traditional ""thobes"" for men.Liberalisation driveThe fashion show, unthinkable in the kingdom barely four years ago, was organised at the residence of the Belgian ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

It comes amid Prince Mohammed's contentious drive to shake off his country's ultra-conservative image by allowing cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas.

But despite the liberalisation drive, organising the event appeared to be mired in government red tape.

Two sources close to the organisers told AFP that Saudi authorities initially refused to grant the Belgian embassy permission to host the show.

There was no public comment from authorities or the Belgian embassy. After heated diplomatic wrangling, the show was eventually allowed to proceed, the sources said.

The event toasted the stylish abayas, which Princess Safia says will go on sale in the kingdom.

There was however hardly an abaya in sight in the audience, which was restricted to roughly three dozen people amid the coronavirus pandemic, including Saudi royal family members, diplomats and social media influencers.

Despite the small crowd, the show marked progress compared to previous fashion events.

In April 2018, Jean Paul Gaultier and Roberto Cavalli headlined the kingdom's first ever Arab Fashion Week -- a women-only event that barred not only men but also cameras.

And in June 2018, a video of dresses floating in the air, suspended from drones, at a fashion show in the Red Sea city of Jeddah went viral on social media.

It was ridiculed widely as a ""ghost show"", with comments online peppered with ghost emojis.

"Jan 26, 2021","The dream of travelling to Paris to show your collections to the world has changed for designers. The desire to win over the fashion capital is still a goal for Spanish designers, but the journey there is now virtual and the long dreamt-of runway shows have been converted into bite-sized videos, with which brands must catch the attention of journalists, buyers and fashionistas. Saved by their talent and creativity, Spanish designers Arturo Obegero and Alled-Martínez managed the difficult task of standing out from the crowd during Paris' latest online menswear fashion week, which wrapped up on Sunday, 24 January. Palomo Spain, which opted out of fashion week this season, tends to be the first Spanish brand that comes to mind when Parisians are asked to cite menswear designers. Experts on the matter – regulars at Florentine men's fashion trade fair Pitti Uomo, for example – might also recall the capes and Cordovan hats produced by Oteyza, which presented its latest collection in the French capital a few days ago. 

However, they are not the only brands from the country that are hungry for international acclaim. Setting themselves up as independent designers, Arturo Obegero and Alled-Martínez round out the Spanish contingent in Paris, presenting highly contemporary collections, which point the way towards an avant-garde vision of masculinity.A native of Tapia de Casariego, in the region of Asturias, who trained at Lanvin, Obegero is a breath of fresh air in the Parisian runway calendar, and only nine months after founding his own eponymous brand. ""I want there to be soul and poetry behind it. I don't want to create a product, there are already lots of those on Instagram,"" said the designer in an interview with FashionNetwork.com when he launched his label. 

As he continues on the path to maturity, the emerging designer has presented ""Puro Teatro,"" his Fall/Winter 2021 collection. The series of velvet looks incorporates structured bows, enormous scarves and strapless necklines, evoking the red roses that were once thrown onto stages at the end of each show. Obegero reclaimed old stage curtains from theatres in cities including London and Sidney, in shades of crimson, blue and black, using them to dress a single model, who poses as though for a lookbook photo shoot, while Ravel's ""Bolero"" sets the pace. Finally, the camera zooms out to reveal the whole picture, as the model removes his makeup behind the scenes of his own little theatre. 



Barcelona's Alled-Martínez, on the other hand, chose to take his presentation down a more narrative path, creating a kind of fictional trailer, which was directed by Bárbara Barberà and stars influencer Marc Forné. This season, the London-trained, Paris-based designer, who received the LVMH Graduate Prize in 2018 and was nominated for the French group's main award in 2020, opted for a vision ""of desire, darkness and speed"" based on ""a true story.""

An intense journey featuring driving, hitchhiking and drag, the video depicts furtive moonlit encounters in cars, by the roadside and in motels. This trip through liberated sexuality presents a collection made up of tailored pieces, strapless jumpsuits, trousers and fitted turtleneck sweaters. The offering therefore goes beyond knitwear, the specialty of the designer, who cut his teeth at Givenchy and who has, for the first time, designed a line of womenswear, which will be unveiled in full in February.

"Jan 26, 2021","The menswear season in Paris boasts literally scores of nationalities, and plenty of designers who concentrate on wearable clothes with a twist, and a point of view. We look at a four creators who summed up the impressive range of the French season.
 Hed Mayner: Groovy giantismHed Mayner keeps on getting better. There is a growing maturity to his work, and a greater sense of polish about this Israeli designer’s artfully constructed tailoring. 
A fan of big volumes, Mayner manages to make them look flattering, never implausible. Whether his superhero chairman of the board double-breasted suits with rippling sleeves or his modern-day Alpine slope shoulder zoot suits. While Mayner’s Dali Lama dandy white puffer with soaring high collars, finished at the back in beige knit, cried out for a magazine cover.
 
Plus, his elegiac arty gent cutaway wool sweaters and cardigans have oodles of attitude, as do his uber wide sailors deck pants.
 
Finished with soft kepi hats and, softer leather boots, this was a super accomplished collection from Mayner, a former LVMH finalist, who has honed a singular vision of modern menswear tailoring.Ungaro: Comfortable and coolOne house enjoying something of a menswear renaissance is Ungaro, whose designer Philippe Paubert focused on two key elements this season: comfort and knitted fabrics for both tailoring and casualwear. 
“It’s all about allowing movement, performance and giving freedom to the final customer,” explained Paubert, who began at the house over a quarter-of-a-century ago working with founder Emanuel Ungaro.
 
Using the noblest of fabrics, Paubert sewed up impeccable double-face pea coats in mixes of wool and alpaca; and double-face blousons, with interior prints of figurative chimera.
 
Born in Brittany, but living much of the year in Nice, he also showed excellent new takes on traditional Aran Island sweaters, made in mixed up yarns and seen in natty cable pullovers. All seen in a neat collection shot in the atelier of sculptor, Jean Charles Mainardis.
 
For evening, he showed a great tuxedo in turquoise velvet – worn with 16-gauge merino wool. To be worn with sneakers or antique finish wingtips boots. Plus, he whipped up some great logo knit jacquard jackets using the original historical logo. Though his best idea was a putty gray, super soft alpaca and wool cut, like a dressing gown. Comfortably cool, like we said.
 
“'I want my man to be liquid', Emanuel used to say, and I think this guy is,” Paubert, who worked with Ungaro since 1992 and has created over 30 collections for the house, said in a pre-show zoom.

BotterA video of acting and speaking up to save the coral reef system of the Caribbean, specifically in Curacao, from the Botter duo of Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh.

Hence, images of divers swimming in a coral nursery on that island taken on Jan. 10 of this year. Fledgling coral attached to racks tied on the ocean bottom, as volunteers actively fight to restore the reef. 

“This is the idea we have for a better world. This is the idea we have for the Botter world,” reads the film’s statement. 

Eventually, runway models appeared in a huge hanger in a show named 'Romancing the Coral Reef' – a phrase seen on the opening stretch tops worn under crisp suits. One black serge wool suit even comes covered in fishing lures and hooks. Other guys don lure necklaces and buoy bags.

Botter’s signature cut open tailoring ricks throughout, where the jackets are half-completed. All the way to the sailing gear cut with interior stanchions to stand off the body.

Botter, who leapt to fame by winning the Hyères Festival in 2018 with a collection of conceptual Caribbean fishermen, doing what they do best. And for a great cause.Etudes 
Tap dancing, sort of, in Les Halles underground shopping mall, in the fashion flick of Etudes -- a French brand that plays with publishing as much as clothes.

Think French neo-Brutalist fashion, with bearded dude models in trucker jerkins and denim; posh punk red heads in khaki trousers; hippie floral shirts; brass colored nylon flight jackets; or broken big cat print cardigans.

When the lights go down in Les Halles, now known as Westfield, there is break dancing outside; and classical street wear inside – in Etudes’ case that is a cheap laundromat.

In a word, hard to understand what the point of the exercise was.

Namacheko: Kifta Chic

“I like clothes that are a little heavy. That signifies quality to a Kurd,” smiles Dilan Lurr, founder and designer of Namacheko.
 
The son of a Kurdish immigrant who grew up in Sweden, Lurr became a designer almost by accident, after a Paris boutique bought all the costumes he made for an indie art movie.
 
Five years later, he is one of the more intriguing voices in the Paris menswear season, who showed a series of fantastic dense wool double-breasted gentleman coats, cut and worn with swagger. While his deep-pile cardigans and chunky faux-sheepskin jerkins looked ideal for the stormy weather hitting Europe this week.
 
Something of a multi-disciplinary artist, Lurr even accompanied his collection with an excellent lookbook meets magazine, named Somnambulism. Though far from sleepwalking, Lurr is very much alive and his inventive collection manages to encapsulate a mix of Kurdish folkloric culture with Scandi solidity. Call it Kifta Chic.
 
Boramy Viguier: Disney in Winterfell

One has to hand it to Boramy Viguier for effort. The young French designer invented a whole cosmos for this collection – sort Game of Thrones meets a daffy Disney.
 
A luscious elfin babe introducing the history entitled Resurrection. “After the sixth mass extinction the known cosmos is ruled by the evil king, Atlas the First,” she explains before illustrations of the rotten ruler and police state bullies.
 
Fortunately, a few knights resisted the dominant power, and wisely chose to get dressed by Boramy Viguier. Named the Phoenix Troopers they appeared in russet-hued velvet capes; chunky hand-knit ethnic sweaters studded at the shoulders and black leather monkish cassock puffers.
 
Before it all ends with rumble in a gothic courtyard, a dragon flying overhead. Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

"Jan 26, 2021","The opening day of Paris haute couture week ended with three experienced, yet still very youthful designers -- Giambattista Valli, Julie de Libran, and Olivier Theyskens at Azzaro, showing collections that captured the unique energy that couture still ignites.
 Giambattista Valli: Cultural melting pot couture 
“My clients don’t want luxury ready-to-wear they want fantasy, big statement couture,” explained Valli, the fittest couturier in Paris, who in between designing collections gets boxing lessons from his personal trainer. 
He pulled no punches with his latest couture collection; maximalist couture of fantastical proportions that nonetheless manages to be delicate and uber refined. Unveiled Monday evening in a video where a dashing male ballet dancer serenades a series of elusive beauties. A terrific courtship dance juxtaposed with images of historic Seville.
 
This summer, the Roman-born couturier wants his faithful fans in capes made of cascading layers of multi-frilled silk taffeta; or balloon shaped tulle pleated skirts topped with embroidered lamé brocade waistcoats.
 
For more seductive moments, draped silk screen goddess gown trimmed with ostrich feathers or clouds of tulle cocktail dresses embroidered in porcelain flower ramage; a special concoction of hand-cut, tulle-backed leather petals and flowers delicately sewn onto many looks.
 
Valli divided his Christmas break between Rome and Seville. The first allowing him to lunch for multiple hours in open restaurants; the second served as the inspiration for this collection.
 
“I find Seville, and also Tangiers, as both fascinating. Because there is this meeting of two cultures – Hispanic and Islamic -  that leads to the creation of a third culture, a hybrid culture where the best of two world mingle. And after the last few years, we need open borders and open minds again,” stressed Valli in a personal preview with FashionNetwork.com.
 
Flamenco fantasies wandered beneath Moorish towers. Pointillist coque-tips and ostrich feathers evoked the beauty of the gardens of Alcazar, while glittering polka dot ball gowns and golden dusk silk chiffon evening looks captured the Golden Age of Seville when Magellan departed on the first circumnavigation of the earth.
 
Valli’s work has achieved a new élan ever since he took on Artemis – the investment vehicle of the Pinault family – as a minority partner two years ago. There’s an increasing lightness to the designs and greater levity in their construction.
 
“It’s been a very beneficial investment. I can concentrate on what I do best, and I believe my work is stronger than ever,” concluded Valli.
 Azzaro: Cinematic chicThe only thing missing was Romy Schneider in the latest collection for the house of Azzaro by Belgian creator, Olivier Theyskens.A retro-modern homage with gallons of gumption; the collection was displayed in a dashing black and white video, shot near Maison Lafitte just outside of Paris. Moody metallic mode dissected by razor sharp cheekbones.
 
Playing with the house’s origins in 70s, high-octane glamour and metal cluster codes, Theyskens showed a hyper focused collection that will turn thousands of heads this summer.
 
Silk and viscose crushed velvet columns; glittering anthracite crystal sheathes; A-Line dresses in transparent organza fully embroidered in jet; or screen goddesses in crepe with metallic thread.
 
His ionic look, and opening image in the video, was a triple ring motif cut-out in a crepe dress. Triple ring holes then cut into multiple looks.
 
“For me haute couture is seasonless,” explained Theyskens, who deep dived into the Azzaro archive collection in the 11th arrondissement and saw the dresses the founder created for Dalida.
 
In a co-ed collection, he also showed rock star silver mesh suits; and classy impresario coats dusted in crystals. The lone guy and lone gal model circling each other in this homage to the Nouvelle Vague.
 Julie de Libran: At home with Camille RoweJulie de Libran is such a self-confident couturier she even appears in her own video clips. This season lighting a cigar for a willowy beauty Camille Rowe in the opening image of her video, before the two enjoy a dance in crystalline sequined party frocks. 
That’s right before Rowe, a green-eyed French American beauty, gets into a bath; where, French style, she enjoys a glass of Bordeaux. Time lapses of her show the model throwing on frilly mini dresses; or charming micro-floral wrap gowns.
 
De Libran, the hippest indie couturier in Paris, also ventured into tailoring with a great double-breasted boyfriend’s blazer and mini white jackets.
 
All shot with grace by director Sonia Sieff in Julie’s elegantly eclectic Parisian modernist Saint German apartment. The clothes had all the charm one associates with that every trendy neighborhood, and the accessories – jewelry by Goossens and shoes by Manolo Blahnik - were impeccable. However, for a contribution to Paris couture week, while charismatic and cool, this felt a little slight.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 25, 2021","Copenhagen Fashion Week said on Monday that H&M Studio will be joining its digital edition for this season, showing the direct-to-consumer SS21 collection.The Swedish retail giant’s digital presentation will be part of the official schedule of the event at 14:00 CET on February 2.

It’s an important move as fashion weeks work to stay as relevant as possible and to grab as many headlines as they can in a world without the physical runway shows on which they once relied. H&M has always shown itself to be very adept as getting publicity for its H&M Studio line so the link-up should be mutually beneficial.

""We are happy that H&M have chosen to show their H&M Studio SS21 collection in Copenhagen as it continues to emphasise the importance of Copenhagen Fashion Week as a key global fashion week, for both its showcase of the leading Nordic brands and its dedicated focus on positive change in the fashion industry,"" said the event’s chief executive Cecilie Thorsmark of the news.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 25, 2021","Jennifer Ellis has never met Bernie Sanders but she is enjoying a taste of his celebrity as the woman behind the mittens that gave the Vermont senator his viral moment at President Joe Biden's inauguration.Ellis, a 42-year-old elementary school teacher, lived a quiet life in the Vermont town of Essex Junction -- until Wednesday.

She was teaching class online like any other day, as Biden was being sworn in, when her phone started pinging with texts.The messages were all the same, Ellis told AFP via a video interview: ""Bernie Sanders is wearing your mittens!""

Not your typical hand warmers, they are made from repurposed wool sweaters and fleece made from recycled plastic bottles for the inside lining.

The ones Sanders wore are big and thick and in shades of brown and beige. And they have story behind them.

Ellis, a fan of Sanders, sent him a pair of mittens after he lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, as a consolation gift.

She learned through a common acquaintance that Sanders liked the mittens.

Last year, as Sanders was running again for president, Ellis learned that he was wearing the mittens -- ""people were calling them his oven mitts"" -- but had lent them to someone else.

Ellis said she was so touched by this that she sent Sanders another 10 pairs.13,000 emailsThat earned her a buzz of notoriety but it was nothing compared with the fuss since the inauguration, when people saw Sanders wearing the mittens.

And Sanders's overall look -- in a frumpy winter coat, his legs crossed, no glamor whatsoever -- prompted a gush of light-hearted memes.

Ellis' phone will not stop ringing and her email inbox is exploding.

One of the memes placed Sanders on a bench next to Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"", another put him in detention with the teenagers from ""The Breakfast Club"" and he also made it into numerous ""Star Wars"" scenes.

""I mean, people are so funny. And that's what we need right now: it's a very tough time for a lot of people, people have had a rough year, and they need something to laugh about that's totally harmless and not political,"" Ellis said.

""The thing that I wish for everybody is more joy,"" she added. ""And you know, if you have something and you give it away, and it brings somebody joy and then it blows up and the entire world experiences joy, that's amazing.""

Ellis could make a lot of money because in two days she says she has received around 13,000 emails from people who want to buy her mittens.

""Not just one pair -- people want lots of them,"" she said.

But she could never satisfy that demand, with her 30-year-old sewing machine, and her job as a second grade teacher. And she does not even want to.

""I think it would just ruin the beauty of it if I started price gouging people,"" she said.

She prefers to spend time with her family, including her five-year-old daughter.

And if others are out there selling mittens on the internet, she wishes them well.

On Friday, some websites were advertising mittens they said were identical to Ellis's creation, for $85 a pair.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Jan 25, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic has confined fashion weeks to the web, but this is only “an interlude”, said Pascal Morand, executive president of the French Fashion and Haute Couture Federation, who believes in the future of the Paris Fashion Week.Can we still talk about a Paris Fashion Week when everything is happening online?

Pascal Morand: This third digital fashion week is nothing new for us, we were very quick in setting up a website [to live-stream catwalk shows and presentations last summer]. The second fashion week was phygital, a mix of physical presentations and web shows.For the latest, we were ready, there were no surprises. In future, when we’ll return to physical shows, a digital dimension will remain. What was initially an element of resilience, has become a driver of innovation and creativity.

We’ve fully plunged into the 21st century. In yesterday’s world, digital was a complement to physical, now it's the opposite. Across all market segments, the share of e-tail sales has grown from 13% to 25%.

Only what can’t be digitalised stays physical. We’re all tired of Zoom meetings, where basic sensory needs are far from fulfilled. [On-screen] visualisation is never the same [as reality], and this is especially true in fashion, where there's motion, fabrics, fluidity and precision.

The digital dimension is very far from a specifically human kind of visual resolution, in terms of contrast, colour and depth.

There is something of an interlude in the way we are experiencing life, and it's affecting all [fashion] capitals. But Paris’s appeal for emerging labels remains unchanged. Paris is where they want to make a name for themselves.

How is the crisis impacting the sector?

PM: The impact is significant. Looking at the French apparel market in the narrow sense, in 2020 it slumped by between 17% and 18%. The better-equipped labels are those that have greater digital clout, and are exporting to China.

Luxury labels export up to 90% of their revenue, notably in Asia and China, and often have a well-established digital presence. This is perhaps a survival factor, generating resilience and the ability to bounce back in the present situation.

Being embodied in a designer or creative director gives labels an extra asset. The labels showing at the Paris Fashion Week have enough strength to navigate this period. It's tough for younger labels, and we're supporting them.

Some labels have dropped out of the official calendar, others present fewer collections, smaller labels are developing a taste for the web. What will happen to fashion weeks after the pandemic?

PM: The risk inherent in going digital is losing the sense of rhythm afforded by fashion weeks.

Certain rituals are disappearing, but it is by no means the case with us. There is a great need for creative expression. We’re noticing how creativity is extending to other domains, with film and video-makers, comic-strip and video-game designers getting involved.

When normal life will resume, we will need to reconsider how to stage catwalk shows, how to create physical events with a digital complement.

If everyone drops out of the system, everyone loses out. In the current situation, it’s good that there are safeguards, elements of credibility. The official calendar has always been a democratising factor. Everyone on it enjoys equal standing, both major labels and those that have recently joined, despite the huge difference in revenue and reputation.

And audiences are a way of channelling influence, of communicating, they breathe life into events. They also have an impact on the digital dimension, because show guests disseminate information.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Jan 24, 2021","The Millon auction house is presenting ""Chantal Thomass '40 years of fashion'"", an auction dedicated to the most emblematic pieces of the famous fashion designer's unique offbeat, freewheeling and irreverent style. More than just a sale, it is a retrospective of her work and visions of femininity in the 1980s and '90s, which collectors and enthusiasts will be able to discover on March 5.If Chantal Thomass is often associated with the world of lingerie -- and rightly so, we should not forget that she has also made significant contributions to redesigning the contours of ready-to-wear and femininity, in the '80s and '90s. This auction, orchestrated by Millon, will therefore not only offer a selection of undergarments, however emblematic they may be, but also pay homage to her entire body of work, from ready-to-wear to undergarments, shoes and accessories, to name but a few.

The auction will be held at Paris's Drouot auction site on March 5, under the direction of Chantal Thomass herself, in partnership with Didier Ludot, a renowned expert in 20th century haute couture and luxury ready-to-wear. Collectors and fashion enthusiasts will have the chance to bid on more than 270 pieces of ready-to-wear and accessories that will go under the hammer.This sale provides an opportunity to look back on the career of the designer, from the beginnings of the Chantal Thomass label in 1975 to her role as artistic director for Coca-Cola Light in 2014 and the launch of her first perfume in 2002. A career that perfectly illustrates the versatile, multifaceted quality of the designer, renowned throughout the world. This retrospective sale will also allow the public to (re)discover some of the most emblematic pieces of the designer, and some that are offbeat, even a little bit cheeky.

Fashion lovers will be able to appreciate the ""vase and flowers"" hat in multicolored straw from the spring-summer 1992 collection, a ""telephone"" shoulder bag in black patent from fall-winter 1984, ""mask"" mules in red leather and black leather with rhinestones from fall-winter 1992, or this ""strapless"" backpack in orange nylon lined with mink from winter 1990. Spectacular fashion pieces will also be in the spotlight, such as this unique ivory quilted ""parka"" dress from a collaboration with Moncler for fall-winter 1992. 

Ahead of Millon's sale taking place at Paris's Drouot on March 5, following three exhibit days, there will be an online sale starting in mid-February. This sale will bring together no fewer than 355 pieces designed by Chantal Thomass.Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2021","Casablanca, the upbeat party-hearty French brand enjoying explosive growth, debuted its first womenswear collection this weekend with a Casino Royale-style after-party video shot on the Champs-Élysées. 
""It’s my image of the team of season: Formula One in a Casino in Monaco – all dressed in Casablanca,"" explained founder and designer Charaf Tajer, who shot his show video inside the Traveller's Club, a 19th-century mansion built by a courtesan on the Champs-Élysées, with rooms for gents and a tony casino.
 
Shot on Monday, and edited over several nights, the show video was unveiled Saturday night and featured a cast of fictive Grand Prix pilots, lovers and glamazons.For women: capes in red checkered flags, saucy black and white checkered cocktails, silk blouses with stocks, or snazzy 70s pantsuits. All the gals guzzled on champagne; one combed the hair of a giant white poodle. The boys poured the bubbly constantly. 
 
There was even a groovy Greta Garbo figure, in a skull cap and a Vionnet-worthy pale green cocoon coat, secretly whished through the marble foyer to her suite. The gals sported green eyeshadow, the same shade as the scores of tropical plants placed around the club. 
 
Casablanca guys – a diverse cast reflecting contemporary France – donned male versions of the Chanel suit, but with pants and made in colander-weave cotton; preppy yellow and pink Ralph Lauren pants and trompe-l’oeil tuxedos.
 
It was all almost an enormous pastiche, were it not for the fact that Charaf is a first-rate print specialist – mingling Art Deco gothic, race-car illustrations and retro card designs. In a word, he is the Roberto Cavalli of the Côte d’Azur; or maybe the Versace of the Atlas Mountains.
 
Last summer, Casablanca debuted a women’s capsule collection on Net-a-Porter to test the market and it was a major success, encouraging Charaf to launch a full line. In the end, there were 50 looks each for men and women in this big party, which was shot respecting Covid rules. 
""I love every look. They are all like my kids. It’s a real pleasure to create a Casablanca wardrobe for women for our first co-ed show. She is stronger than the man,"" smiled Charaf, speaking from a studio in Paris, in the 18th-arrondissement neighborhood of Barbusse, rented for casting and fittings.
 
Asked which women he would most like to dress, Charaf replied – Jackie Onassis, Sade, and Gabrielle Chanel. Sounds like another great party. As indeed was this show video, named ""Grand Prix,"" the name of probably the greatest sporting feature film made, that managed to include both Françoise Hardy and Juan Manuel Fangio in its cast.
 
Strong women clearly appeal to Charaf, who only launched his brand with a Spring/Summer 2019 collection in June 2018. His opening showroom was his mother’s living room in Belleville, the bustling neighborhood in northern Paris. Now, barely five seasons later, Casablanca retails in over 200 doors, including top-line destination retailers like Browns, United Arrows, Maxfield, Smets and Isetan. The likes of Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber have all been seen wearing Casablanca.
 
Quizzed about his company turnover, he responded: ""I’m French and don’t like to talk about my money, just my dreams.""
 
Though based in Paris, half his creative team and management live in London, bringing further logistical headaches.
 
""Technically we have been harder hit due to pandemic. Most of the team couldn’t come to Paris – as most have UK passports. Deliveries are late and several factories closed,"" he shrugged.
 
Nonetheless, the Covid crisis didn’t alter the Casablanca aesthetic. ""What did change was that we are dreaming harder and loving more and dreaming bigger. As I believe that today the notions of dreams; putting on clothes, freedom and travel are amplified,"" he insisted.
 
Charaf is such an uber-focused marketing man, he plastered his interlocking double C logo over most anything – negligee dresses, leather weekend bags, silk mechanic’s shirts. Talk about gall – Charaf made a mock Marlboro cigarette packet, inserted the word ""Casablanca,"" and made that into a silk playboy shirt.
 His next dream is to open a flagship, even as the web grows more important. 
 
""I only want a few stores, five or six in major cities like Tokyo, Paris, London, New York, LA and Shanghai... oh, and Casablanca. Where each would be more like a Casablanca embassy. More an experience or a retail moment than just a shop,"" he explained.
 
Alfred Hitchcock style, Charaf even managed to make a brief appearance in his own fashion film, playing the piano. Bow your head, John Frankenheimer, Yves Montand and Toshiro Mifune too.
 
""Yes, I take risks yes but wearable risks. If not, it is not interesting. Because people want to feel part of something in important moments in their life – vacations, meetings or family,"" concluded the ever-smiling designer.
 
Like it or not, Paris fashion establishment, Charaf is the next big thing in French fashion.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2021","The architecture was almost as much a star as the clothes in the latest ""performance broadcast"" by the esteemed house of Hermès, which unveiled its Fall 2021 collection for men on Saturday.  
Hermès was by far the biggest brand showing on the fifth day of a six-day 68-brand Paris menswear season, which, due to the pandemic, is taking place entirely online.
 
And the location was pretty ideal for the collection, as polished an example of classy modern menswear as one can imagine in 2021, and one in keeping with the current zeitgeist. Lockdown leisure clothing where comfort, not cool, is of the essence.Teaming up for the second season with filmmaker Cyril Teste, the house’s menswear designer Véronique Nichanian staged her show video inside the Mobilier National, a massive multi-story modernist structure by architect Auguste Perret, the master of reinforced concrete. The space houses valuable furniture from ministerial buildings, and its rectangular stairwells, geometric metal railings and opaque glass walls were an ideal setting for these smart, swish clothes.
 
Shearling jerkins with reverse panels, Baracuta jackets with prominent zips, natty chesterfields, deerskin smocks and party shirts – all had the signature Hermès high-end allure. Plus, Véronique showed some great pants, cut with a beveled thigh and split at the ankle
 
Besides being a great self-editor, Nichanian is a first-rate colorist. In a season of plaid her tartans looked the freshest – in particular the pale blue and putty windcheaters worn with matching vests. 
 Handsome guys hanging out inside the light-filled building as the music by Emmanuel Jessua built to a synth climax with ""Cape Town"" by Sides.
 
Nichanian, however, should probably consider revamping her casting. Too many ideal future son-in-laws can get dull. And a fair few of the sneakers were decidedly twee.
 
That said, the clothes looked ready made for the kind of smart guys who have just taken a Silicon Valley unicorn public, as they truly reek of discrete luxury.

"Jan 23, 2021","Fashion’s latest show-in-a-book came from Loewe, in a collection unveiled Saturday that revolves around the estate of Joe Brainard, the American artist who worked in various formats including Pop Art, subversive comic books, faux religious collage and, ultimately, a literary autobiography entitled I Remember. 
Pre-show, favored friends of the house were shipped a handsome package with multiple examples of the work of Brainard, a key figure in the New York art underground a half-century ago.
 
Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson employed the artist’s collages of pansies in oversized floor-length wool cardigans and translated his flower series into other Loewe mediums like intarsia leather bags.Anderson even showed triangular tent-shaped trousers – two huge floral rectangles when pulled out – worn by a model dancing awkwardly inside a photo studio.
 
The best effect was probably the pale blue mega patchwork shearing coats featuring panels of Brainard’s petal paintings, mice sketches and photography. However, the designer got rather carried away with his multiple garments – from a double polo shirt to a triple mohair sweater, riffing on Brainard’s concept of repetition.
 
This was, as Anderson chose to put it, part of creating “a conceptual object within fashion.” The best example of which was the striking leather biker pants, zipped up from ankle to waist and finished with multiple belts up and down the leg. Hyper posh punk looks, in stark contrast to the girly folds of knit shorts for boys.
 
""I like this idea of taking feminine clothes and re-cutting them out of menswear fabrics… showing a double-face cashmere that looks kind of sensual,"" said the designer, perched on a stand-away stairway, his words seen in subtitles, in both English and Chinese.
 
The show book also contained images of the women's pre-collection and again Brainard’s floral paintings, seen in smocks and baseball caps. All the way to a t-shirt, the print of which incorporates most of the looks. 
The key to Anderson’s meteoric rise within the LVMH luxury empire – which owns Loewe – has been based on the striking success of his many bags for this Spanish luxe marque. This season he plastered Brainard’s images – sleeping whippets, or sphinx-like teens – all over leather totes and logo wallpaper handbags to great effect.
 
Above all, the show book captured some of the energy and exuberance of New York in its heyday, fondly remember by those of us who had the pleasure of enjoying our coming of age in the heart of the East Village in the 70s and 80s. That said, though a distinctive voice in the canon of New York modern art, Brainard is hardly a Bacon, Botticelli or Braque.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 23, 2021","Black culture encountered British classicism again at Wales Bonner, where the leitmotif this season was the poetry of Derek Walcott, the Nobel Prize winner born on the small Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. 
Like much of Walcott’s remarkable poetry, which references his back-and-forth between his hometown of Castries, and his time as a professor in New York and Boston, the mood of this collection by Grace Wales Bonner was rhapsodic and nostalgic.
 
Opening with shots of a Caribbean forest – wind blowing though huge banana tree leaves – and capturing Walcott’s calls for a return to traditional life as an antidote to colonialism, the five-minute film is the concluding chapter of a trilogy designed to illuminate the world of ""Caribbean Thought and Black British Intellectualism.""A young gent in a houndstooth check jacket reads poems from works like The Prodigal or The Gulf, by Walcott, a statue of whom stands in St Lucia’s capital.
 
Seconds later, there appears an exceptional black and white shirt with a beautiful image of a small fishing boat heeling in a windy gulf. Though shot in Jamaica and London, the film captures the sense of longing for one’s homeland in the work of Walcott and his longing for Saint Lucia, a particularly beautiful island famed for dual southern volcanic peaks, the Pitons.
 
Perfectly cut Norfolk jackets in beige checks with contrast collars; pristine white tuxedo jackets – from a collaboration with Savile Row tailors Anderson & Sheppard – with band collar shirts and charming pajama pants in broad stripes. All mingled in with Wales Bonner’s collab with adidas, adding a kickier note to the fashion film, where the light seemed to caress the entire cast, lingering over the beauty of youth.The video, by the designer and Jamaican filmmaker Jeano Edwards, who also read the poems on the soundtrack, was entitled ""The Light of Black Sunlight."" All told, it was a touching expression of Black nobility at its sartorial best. Which rather sums up Wales Bonner’s whole career and aesthetic.
 
Surely this film would have appealed to Walcott, whose poem ""Statues"" reads:
""Boys will be boys.
Who can instruct them where true honour lies?
Instinct or choice,
Proclaims it lies within
War’s furious, dandiacal discipline.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 23, 2021","Not many designers can ever boast that they have entered the second half-century of their career, but Sir Paul Smith can, and did, this week – celebrating with a remastered menswear collection of many of his greatest hits.
 The fashionable knight riffed through multiple eras, and musical genres – including the Two Tone and Northern Soul – in an impressively wearable collection.
 
""It’s a very Smithy collection. Because I have been in this studio for the whole year sometimes on my own, with no travelling and restaurants and museums closed. So, I thought I want to tap into all those British sub cultures but in a modem way, with a Paul Smith mix of check with check and pattern on pattern,"" explained Smith in a phone call from London.Though based in London, Smith has shown his menswear collection in Paris for many decades. Maintaining the tradition, he unveiled his show video in this week’s entirely digital Paris menswear season on the official Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode website.
 
""No zoom! I still use a pencil,"" cackled Sir Paul, who showed several great tartan suits that riffed on The Specials and lead signer Terry Hall’s fondness for strictly cut suits.
 
Smith also sampled Mod mode with natty Harrington jackets that themselves referenced Ivy League Brooks Brothers jackets and short Baracuta jackets.
 
Like a lot of his colleagues, the knight designer played with mohair – the wool of the current season – but gave it a grunge reference; before playing on an idea taken from an old Aquascutum raincoat in weatherproof material, but reinvented in cashmere and wool.
 
""The suits industry is very complicated right now. So, we like more of a workwear jacket, though ours is made in a Loro Piana fabric,” explained Smith, who even showed donkey jackets. Traditionally made with leather shoulders for coalmen to carry heavy sacks, Smith’s donkey version came in orange cashmere twined with wool, and was paired with a new loafer with a crepe sole.
 
Referencing his beginnings with his original shop in Nottingham, Smith even produced some Hawaiian shirts.
 
""Back then the Wigan all-nighters would come down to my shop on a Saturday in a pack of Ford Cortinas to buy Hawaiian shirts for dancing and raving all night,"" he laughed.
 And the nostalgia for foreign travel was evident in a series of ikat woven patterns, once again remastered in abstract versions and made in Como, Italy. Smith discovered ikats on his first visit to India in 1970s.
 
""I bought a suitcase full of ikats and came home delighted, only to realize that in Southall you could buy them all there from the Indian community. He he!"" Smith mused.
 
Now that he has passed the half century, has Sir Paul ever thought of retirement?
 
""Retire? That’s a foreign word in this office! I’ve still got the legs of a teenager and and am blessed with a good young team around me. There’s lovely energy in company,"" he harrumphed with a huge laugh.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 22, 2021","Maybe we should rename Paris as Tokyo on the Seine; or greater Shanghai, or even suburban Taipei? 
In a fully digital menswear season featuring 68 brands, videos by Asian designers stood out for their energy, ideas and no-holds-barred fashion audacity. Barely halfway through the six-day Paris menswear fashion week featuring Fall-Winter 2021 collections, a gang of a dozen Asian creators grabbed attention for their upfront style, novel ideas and excellent castings.
 
Few schools of designers appear to have profited from the lockdown to rethink their DNA as smartly as these creators.Take Kidill, a Japanese label whose video recalled the Transavangardia of '80s Italy, even as it referenced UK goth punk and street graffiti.
 
It could easily have been a mess, but Kidill’s designer Hiroaki Sueyasu is also a gifted tailor so his absurdist, angry black-and-white face prints ended up looking bold and brilliant.
 
In a co-ed clip entitled Desire, Sueyasu also showed white denim jackets punked up with mini black-and-white photo appliqués; floral graffiti kimonos and poetic velvet suits for young literary lions - Jean-Paul Sartre in Shinjuku.

The soundtrack mingled slashing guitars and wailing in Japanese, sounding like a witch out of a Kurosawa epic. His cast marched screaming around a battered studio like characters from a Samuel Beckett tragi-comedy.
 
Or consider Sankuanz, China’s hippest designer, who managed to stage a stealth video underneath and inside the Eiffel Tower in the middle of the night. Talk about Chinese chutzpah.
 
And respect for Kolor by Junichi Abe, the Comme des Garçon alumnus who always commands lots of attention. His one-hour video took 45 minutes before it actually began. It turned out to be an actual co-ed show set in a dreamy wood, where the cast appeared in Abe’s latest version of amalgamated fashion, a composite collection where garments intermingled. 
Like a brilliant double sweater – part cable, part cricket  – where one neck hole became a shoulder; or a very chill Japanese figure in a series of bravura tweed parkas finished on one shoulder with half a hunting vest.
 
For the gals, a fab coppery Aran tank, one side of which was absent, seen over a classy wool caban;  to a majestic triple-lapel ensemble of three jackets – hacking jacket, Scottish tweed and football-star caban on an Asian beauty with an afro – part of an excellent Kolor cast.
 
In a word, the most mature and commercial collection of an already acclaimed and truly influential designer.
 
Mihara Yasuhiro
Shinjuku chic from Mihara, who showed a great clip – wannabe yakuzas downing whiskey in a karaoke bar. Where the videos are of hipster youth – guys and girls – in composite clobber from the Japanese designer with the most range. Posh punk; bourgeois grunge and upper-middle-class skateboarders all got a look in. All of them the epitome of cool, as the bar exploded into an after-party. Exactly what makes Tokyo the world’s most foreign major capital.
 
Juun.J
Juun named his collection Persona, and its Grand Guignol chic in a Tokyo high school had voluminous authority. From the ballooning flight jackets for guys to the Catherine de' Medici nylon widows dresses for the gals. Fashion packed with personality for those with the guts and gusto to wear it. 
Yoshio Kubo
Revamped workwear from this young designer, who founded his brand in Tokyo in 2014, and shot his show video inside a woodworking shop and furniture factory. All very much hybrid style – anthracite surgeons’ smocks with patch pockets; elongated judo jackets; tie-dyed parkas with fly fishermen detailing; and a marvelously oversized duffle coat. Eat your heart out General Montgomery.
 
Due to the lockdown, designers have legitimately been complaining about the lack of models in Paris. Turns out many of the best have been hanging out in Japan. Yoshio hired a gang of them.
 
Angus Chiang
The less said about this collection of oversized David Byrne of Talking Heads suits; tatty-glam golden cocktail dresses and bulbous red carpet looks by Angus Chiang the better. Still, the staging was gutsy – a mock movie premiere, with a toothy TV host gushingly introducing mock Chinese stars. Okay, not every Asian talent got it right.
 
Sulvam
One can also include a very honorable mention for Sulvam, with its fishtail smocks; cut-out sweaters; retro soul-singer leather clubbing jackets and chainmail-print pajamas – for guys and girls. In yet another cool display by designer Teppei Fujita, a former pattern maker for Yohji Yamamoto who opened his own label, Sulvam, in 2013. A Tokyo Fashion Award winner whose precise sense of deconstruction is always eye-catching.
 
Taakk
Plaudits for the train journey video to a rocky seashore from Taakk, the subtlest of the new generation Japanese fashion designers. Soft yet quirky materials; marvelous green moiré velvet jackets; perfectly styled modernist M-65 jackets and orchid-blotch print sweatshirts.
 
Plus the grandfathers of Asian fashion – Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto – were both in fine fettle. 
Miyake’s newest Homme Plissé collection was called Never Change, Ever Change.  And the familiar yet novel corduroy plissé vest and jackets; perfectly cut band-collar shirts; nipped-at-the-ankle pants and classy chesterfield coats all looked uber flattering. As did a ribbed purple duster that was to die for.
 
Added to that the samurai on the kimonos in zig-zag prints and crushed microfiber futurist spy coats, and this was a brilliant statement of natty nesting style by the designer who dreamed up the notion decades before any pandemic.
 
Finally, the Neil Young de la Mode himself, Yamamoto-sama, who sang his own bluesy soundtrack – in Japanese. The 77-year-old master holding an actual behind-closed-doors show in Japan.
 
Gun motifs of satin coats; padded polyurethane foam cloaks; saddle-stitch rayon safari jackets with metal trim.  Lots of script over half the collection: from 'Are You Bohemian,' or 'Born to be a Terrorist' or 'I am Proletariat.'
 
While capturing the world’s dark moment – metal mesh masks and gloves; S 'n' M straight-jackets; mock dog muzzles. 
 
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn.

"Jan 22, 2021","Ahead of the 2021 fashion season, Australian Fashion Week has gained a new title sponsor as it evolves its mission to focus on accessibility, diversity and inclusion, and sustainability. Afterpay Australian Fashion Week (AAFW), previously known as Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, is set to take place May 31 to June 4, at the historic Carriageworks and other select venues throughout Sydney, where designers will showcase their latest Resort ’22 collections.   

Afterpay's new partnership with IMG will champion Australian fashion and “ensure Australian fashion continues to have its unique voice heard”, all while welcoming a new “dynamic experience” championed by new values. As part of its mission to be more inclusive, AAFW is opening its doors to the public and inviting consumers for the first time ever to purchase tickets to select shows on the official schedule and access VIP packages. 

Consumers can now purchase tickets to the opening and closing night runway show, as well as see-now, buy-now runway shows from Bassike, one of Australia’s leading designer fashion brands, and Kit Willow of KITX. 

Moreover, an ongoing series of conversation, dubbed 'The Talks', will be open to consumers including a dialogue around sustainability in fashion called 'Fashioning The Future' and an event with Australian fashion’s next generation of designers called 'Generation: Next'. 

“AAFW: The Experience opens the doors of fashion week to directly advance designers’ retail businesses and creates opportunity to drive loyalty amongst new and existing customers,” said Natalie Xenita, executive director of IMG’s fashion events group, Asia-Pacific region.

“We are thrilled to reconnect with live audiences at Carriageworks with this curated program of runway shows and informative fashion events, to entertain and engage fashion’s most passionate consumers.”

The 2020 edition of Australian Fashion Week was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

IMG was expecting about 1,600 industry professionals from over 20 countries to hit Sydney to see the Resort 2021 ready-to-wear collections.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 21, 2021","Paul García de Oteyza and Caterina Pañeda, the couple behind Spanish tailored apparel brand Oteyza, have returned to Paris Fashion Week this season, having joined the calendar last winter. In light of the health restrictions that have once again pushed back the return of physical runways, the label made a digital presentation entitled ""Arcadia"" on 19 February, unveiling its latest offering for the Fall/Winter 2021-22 season. Swapping out the traditional guest-lined front row for a trip into the great outdoors, where only two models shared the responsibility of displaying all of the collection's pieces, Oteyza looked to nature in order to reflect a return to the brand's own roots. This visual metaphor was also manifest in the classic elements used to produce the brand's pieces, such as Spanish merino wool and organic cotton. 

The purity of the textiles was combined with the traditional aesthetic of the garments, which were all reinterpreted with an avant-garde twist and strong hues, ranging from intense mustard and deep blue, through palettes of browns and greens, to the characteristic Spanish black present in all of the brand's collections. The silhouettes embraced the most classical patterns of the country's traditional tailoring and played with balanced asymmetries, seen in skirts and flowing capes. Showing during men's fashion week, the brand, present for many years at Florentine menswear fair Pitti Uomo, opted for a fusion of genders this season, blurring the boundaries between masculine and feminine. Walking among corn oaks, iconic Spanish model Laura Ponte made the collection her own, effortlessly donning tailored suits, topped off with classic Cordovan hats, alongside Enrique Fariñas.

Founded in 2012, the company currently operates one boutique atelier in Madrid, on Calle Conde de Xiquena. Three years ago the brand received Spain's Premio Nacional de Moda al Emprendimiento and, only a few months later, was named as a finalist in Vogue's ""Who's On Next"" competition.

"Jan 19, 2021","Can we give it up big for Sankuanz, who managed to pull off a brilliant agit-prop style video, shot in the depths of night, using the underneath and inside of the Eiffel Tower as its catwalk?Founded by the designer Shangguan Zhe in 2013, Sankuanz is very possibly China’s single most influential indie fashion marque. The clothes are eye-catching, aggressive and confrontational; mashing up eras and moments – nightclub rockers encountering skateboarders; femme fatales bumping into techy amazons.

There is nothing terribly subtle about Sankuanz, but that is the whole point of the exercise. His fashion is intended to jolt as it juxtaposes eras and attitudes.The result: dystopian dandies in fringed chain mail tops; hand-painted camouflage battle coats or tuxes embroidered with crystal crosses. Dark-hearted moody babes in leather firemen’s coats; pagoda-shoulder lurex nuns' dresses; lime-green hoodies and broken-chalk-stripe bankers' suits.

The cast marching angrily underneath the giant tower, or scowling directly into the camera as they paraded around the wrought iron corridors of France’s most famous tourist sites. Several wearing metal studded masks worthy of Pulp Fiction.

All appearing in an excellent fashion clip, mixing fashion images with dipping drone shots of the Eiffel Tower, directed by Feng Liang. Quite how he managed the shoot remains a mystery. Call it Chinese chutzpah.

Talk about a great video and tough-chic collection from the softly-spoken Zhe, a 2015 LVMH Prize finalist and the designer who – after a modest teaser video from the opening house, Berluti - got the latest Paris menswear season off to a dynamite start.Taakk on the tracks“Is there somebody out there who knows where we will be in 10 years, 20 years? I’d love to meet them. Maybe I already have,” intones the narrator in a charming fashion video from Taakk, the subtlest of the new generation Japanese fashion designers of recent years.Shot as a train journey along railway lines and a rocky seashore in Japan, it carefully highlighted this collection’s strengths – soft classy yet quirky materials; marvelous green moiré velvet jackets; perfectly styled modernist M-65 jackets and orchid-blotch print sweatshirts.

In a completely digital season, designer Takuya Morikawa sent editors a package of three fabrics highlighting their subtlety – transforming cotton into nylon trim, all the better to make an M-65 hang as it should. A gentle touch from a gentle designer and house.Bluemarble’s bad-boy mashupThis fresh French brand began its show video with a young man arriving late in an office, even if he was a noticeably dissolute after-hours sort of youth. Using slick video montage techniques, designer Antony Alvarez took his models on an extended tour of the planet: from university lobbies and gilded mansions to giant cellars and massive vistas of Icelandic expanses.For fall, Alvarez wants his Bluemarble boys in wide pleated pants with studded metal pocket piping; mightily billowing trousers; cloud-print bomber jackets; gold necklace-print silk disco shirts; parachute parkas in yellow and pink. In a word, Instagram-driven rather than sartorially succinct.

Perhaps not the next big thing, but a proper fashion statement from Alvarez, who only founded his house in 2018, and full marks for the inexpensive brand enhancement thanks to this snappy, punchy video directed by Hedi El Chikh.

Whatever else, a fully digital fashion season does unearth some talented film directors.

"Jan 19, 2021","It says a great deal about the current Covid confusion in fashion weeks when the Paris menswear season for fall 2021, the biggest annual series of menswear collections in the world, began on Tuesday with a teaser. 
The source of the leg puller: the house of Berluti, who unveiled a clip of a mere one minute and one second, entitled Living Apart Together, with the added missive that one would have to wait a further six weeks to see anything more. Until March 5, in fact, where there would be a rendez-vous “to discover the full story of the ≠Berluti Winter 2021-2022 collection by Kris Van Assche,” according the brand’s Instagram account.
 
Maybe we should rename the teaser 'Showing Together Apart'?  After this curious method to kick off the six-day Paris menswear catwalk season, which ends Sunday evening, Jan. 24.
 
Instead, the 126-year-old house is planning a live presentation in Shanghai in March. And, given travel restrictions, neither Berluti designer Kris Van Assche nor any of his Paris team will attend that event in China. Instead they will extend this teaser to a 10-screen format.
 
For this fashion amuse-bouche Van Assche teamed up with Russian artist Lev Khesin, whose multi-layered silicone daub paintings were used to great effect in some dashing mohair sweaters.
 
The designer’s pal Yoann Lemoine, AKA French indie rocker Woodkid, was hired as sound designer for the mini clip which was helmed by video director Olivier Casamayou. The teaser had a pop constructionist feel, with quirky graphics, though nothing worthy of Rodchenko, you understand.
 
The precious little fashion one could see did look strong. A very natty burnished leather jerkin in the house’s signature patina; the same material used in some square-toed brothel creepers that marched across the white pop art flooring.
 
Van Assche is a skilled colorist, playing smartly with Egyptian blue pants; dip dyed Clongowes Wood College purple and Olympic blue shirts; or fuchsia trousers worn under retro check raincoats. Quite why he fitted out his cast in abstract daub print felt cloche hats was hard to understand, until he showed one with a matching mohair sweater in Khesin’s great colors.
 
Berluti, a company within the LVMH luxury behemoth, controls 10 stores in China, where it will shortly open a pop-up on WeChat. We are sure fans in China and elsewhere will dig this collection when they, finally, get to see it. Though it certainly didn’t start the Paris collections with a bang.

"Jan 18, 2021","Elie Saab has called off his haute couture presentation scheduled for the Paris season next week, as the couturier delays shooting any look-book video in the wake of the crisis in Lebanon.
 
Saab had been scheduled to unveil his next collection during the four-day fully digital haute couture week, on Wednesday, 27 January.  
However, due the pandemic and major health problems caused by coronavirus, the house will not shoot any video for Paris. The past two seasons, Saab shot inventive videos both for ready-to-wear and couture in historic and elegiac settings in the mountains north of Beirut.
 
“The couture collection is ready. But we have had to take this decision to postpone the shoot due to the current situation, where the virus is growing exponentially. There are 7,000 cases a day in Lebanon officially, which compared to our population is very big number. The health care system can not afford any more cases, there is not enough oxygen and respirators in hospitals. So we take care to prioritize health and well being and not take risks. That would be unfair unethical and not responsible,” Elie Saab Jr., the managing director of the Beirut-based fashion brand, told FashionNetwork.com in a call from Beirut.Saab, the Phoenician couturier, is one of the leading shows on the Paris calendar, which next week features over 25 couture shows on the official calendar.
 
Saab Jr. stressed that the house hoped to shoot the video in the next several weeks.
 
“We create beauty and we cannot do that jeopardizing the well being of everyone. But we will do a look-book and video, in a new concept and online presentation; streamed and sent to clients, press and stakeholders,” he insisted.

Saab’s headquarters located in downtown Beirut were partly damaged in the giant explosion that rocked the city in August 2020 and left 190 dead. However, the repairs were completed quite quickly.
 
“We were able to renovate immediately, and up and running 10 days after. We managed to deliver all our confirmed orders. We had a fair amount of business despite Covid-19,” said Saab Jr.
 
Currently, many of the Saab sales force are in Paris, showing the house’s ready-to-wear pre-collection for fall 2021, albeit much of it online.
 
Like the Paris ready-to-wear season itself, the house still has to see whether it can stage a runway show during Paris ready-to-wear week in the first week of March.
 
“March? We still don’t know. Who does? Whether online, phygital or catwalk,” he noted. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2021","The six-day French menswear catwalk season debuts on Tuesday, with a bumper crop of nearly 70 brands, albeit without a single runway show in Paris, due to stringent lockdown rules.Reacting the strict no-live-events rules, the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM), French fashion’s governing body, has amped up its website, with a new editorial team of contributors and linkups with the US' Cable News Network and Kommerzant in Russia, FHCM told FashionNetwork.com. The FHCM’s video feed this season will also be available on four major Chinese platforms -  Tencent, WeChat, Weibo and Douyin.

The link-up with CNN follows on from last season’s fresh partnership with the New York Times and Asahi Shimbun in Japan, which have both created dedicated pages to show the Paris runway and collection videos. All the brand displays are also available on YouTube.Notwithstanding the global pandemic, a total of 68 brands have signed up for coveted slots on the official calendar. The season kicks off on Tuesday, Jan. 19 at 2 p.m. with master tailoring marque Berluti and ends on Sunday, Jan. 24 with fledgling house 1017 ALYX 9SM. The busy week also includes such major global brands as Louis Vuitton, Dior Men, Hermès and Paul Smith.
 
“I believe that the number and quality of the designers testifies to the importance and strength of the Paris season, during a very difficult health crisis,” argued Pascal Morand, Executive President of the FHCM.Paris will also feature multiple influential designer brands like Yohji Yamamoto, JW Anderson, Rick Owens, Dries Van Noten, Vetements, Loewe and Thom Browne. Along with up-and-comers Louis-Gabriel Nouchi; Kolor and Taakk, both of Japan; and Wales Bonner from the UK.

Together with such hot local names as Cool TM, which is planning an installation in storied passage Galerie Vivienne, and Casablanca, which will unspool a video inspired by an imaginary Formula One after-party in Monaco and shot inside the ultra-exclusive Traveller’s Club on the Champs Elysées.

However, in a late decision, Celine pulled out of the Paris season, informing FashionNetwork.com that it will present its collection “a little later” in 2021.

Underling the international magnate that Paris remains in la mode, the majority of houses showing are foreign-based, even if the season has lots of new French faces. A quartet of debutants is composed of Arturo Obegero, Basscoutur and Valette Studio, all from France; and Kidill from Japan.The Federation has also bumped up its website online magazine, renamed Insider, and brought on board a “team of curators,”  including Amy Verner and Gianluca Cantaro.

“In my view, a collection video is an example of augmented creativity. Making them induces an additional time constraint, but they can add so much to a brand and a house’s image,” added Morand.

Like menswear, the haute couture season, which runs from Monday, Jan. 25 to Thursday, Jan. 28, will be an entirely digital season. Morand cautioned that, so far, the FHCM has made no decision on the exact format of the following season – women’s ready-to-wear, scheduled for March 1 to 9, 2021.

“That will be up to our executive committee to decide. But given the recent past, it’s understandable that we will all have to remain flexible. Whatever happens, in the future when we can again have physical shows, the Internet platform we have created will still be a very vital resource,” Morand concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic is once again shaping fashion weeks this season. Rather than New York or London, it's down to Milan to open the Fall/Winter 2021-22 season, which will take place exclusively online this January. Running from 15 to 19 January, Milan Fashion Week Men's will feature 39 brands, few of which are widely known.   
Indeed, most big-name Italian brands have disappeared from Milan men's calendar. Dolce & Gabbana, for example, will be absent from the Milanese runways for the first time in the label's history. The brand was forced to cancel its show at the last minute due to the ""uncertain situation related to Covid-19,"" which meant that the necessary health and safety conditions could not be guaranteed. 
 
The four other houses that had planned a physical show have also had to rethink their approach. Fendi and Etro will both reveal their collections at closed shows, on 16 and 17 January, respectively. K-Way, which is set to make its runway debut in the Lombard capital on Sunday, will now only be able to welcome some 30 guests. As for Korea's Solid Homme, led by Woo Young Mi, which was also supposed to host its first Milanese show on 18 January, the brand has opted to unveil its collection digitally. In terms of exclusively digital presentations, aside from Ermenegildo Zegna, which opens Milan Fashion Week on Friday, 15 January, at 3 PM, and Prada, whose show is scheduled for 17 January, there are hardly any big names this season, which features Iceberg on 16 January, followed by MSGM, Tod’s and Sunnei the next day, and A-Cold-Wall, Magliano and Les Hommes on 19 January.

Gucci, which made its big comeback at Milan Fashion Week Men's last January and participated in its first digital edition in July, has chosen to follow a different rhythm this time around. Also present on July's calendar, Moschino has opted out of this season's event as well, revealing its menswear collection on Thursday, just before the official opening of the Milanese fashion week. 
 
Philippe Plein, Ermanno Scervino, Salvatore Ferragamo, Dsquared2 and Missoni have also all disappeared from the programme, with most of them planning to present their menswear collections with their womenswear offerings in February, alongside Giorgio Armani and Versace.
 
In order to compensate for this exodus, the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana has had no choice but to open its menswear calendar up to new names, including several emerging brands, both homegrown and international. 10 new labels will therefore be making their Milan debuts this season.  
Notably, the event will shine a spotlight on young African, particularly Nigerian, design, which will be represented by three brands. The first of the Nigerian labels on this season's calendar is Lagos Space Programme, which was founded by designer Adeju Thompson in 2014 and emphasises craftsmanship and sustainable fashion. The brand will be joined by Faith Oluwajimi's genderless label Bloke, founded in 2015, and Tokyo James, which is led by Nigerian-born British designer Ineyie Tokyo James. 

Lagos Space Programme will have the privilege of following Ermenegildo Zegna on Friday, a first day which will end with the new project from Florentine designer Federico Curradi and hatter to the stars Nick Fouquet, with whom the Italian previously collaborated for the Rochas menswear collections.
 
Among the other newcomers on the Milanese calendar, K-Way and Solid Homme, mentioned above, will rub shoulders with Moldovan-born, Italy-based designer Dima Leu, who won the Who's On Next menswear category this year; emerging label Vaderetro, founded in 2019 by couple Hanna Boyer and Antonio D'Andrea; Dalpaos, led by up-and-coming designer Nicola D'Alpaos; and New Delhi-based Indian designer and entrepreneur Dhruv Kapoor. 

No other special activations are planned, aside from a few physical presentations and some parallel virtual events, such as Fashion Film Festival Milano, launched seven years ago by Constanza Cavalli Etro, which will participate in Milan Fashion Week for the first time this season, offering a selection of 220 films from 58 countries. 
 
Milan's White trade fair will also be taking place, with a new concept entitled ""WSN Fashion Reboot"", showcasing 40 sustainable brands with either menswear or genderless offerings. This edition of the trade show will run from 16 to 18 January, debuting a fully digital format. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 13, 2021","England may be in lockdown at the moment, but London Fashion Week will go ahead next month, although there will be no live audiences allowed and the week (actually five days) will be fully digital. The British fashion Council said on Wednesday that it has been “discussing with Government the appropriate way forward with regards to London Fashion Week considering the current backdrop to a public health emergency”.

The result of those talks is that the event will run from February 19 until February 23. “Shows, presentations and installations can be filmed and photographed but should not take place with an invited audience,” the BFC said.UK Covid guidance means that filming and shoots can continue for now under secure guidelines.

The event’s home will be www.londonfashionweek.com, which will include all designers showcasing new content and selling new collections with the digital content “accessible to everyone throughout the year”.

The BFC has been engaging with the authorities not only about LFW but about allowing the creative fashion sector to continue functioning more widely.

BFC Chief Executive Caroline Rush, said of all this: “The BFC continues to ask Government to engage in support of the fashion industry. One of the main active requests is to allow key creative and model talent to travel to and from the UK with a phased introduction of quarantine exemptions for the fashion industry, in order to carry out essential business, to protect the competitiveness of the British fashion industry.

“This further lockdown is incredibly challenging for businesses, freelancers and individuals. Our industry is one of amazing creativity and this is more true in the UK than any other country. The majority of businesses and individuals we work with are independent businesses and creatives who contribute significantly to the cultural and creative reputation of our country. 

“We will continue to push for support and champion our extraordinary businesses to global audiences. Despite all the challenges the last few years have brought, I truly believe that the creativity, agility and business savvy of our sector will prevail and the societal conscious of our British businesses and fashion workforce will see us re-calibrate to not only be strong creatively but strong sustainably too.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 12, 2021","Last year the LVMH Prize had to abandon its final due to Covid-19, choosing instead to reward all eight of its finalists. In 2021, the competition for young designers, which was created by the French luxury giant of the same name in 2013, is getting back to business and has already opened applications for its eighth edition. The competition will not, however, be returning to its traditional format. According to a press release, ""as a result of the health crisis, which has imposed certain restrictions, this year the semi-final will, as an exception, be organised as a digital forum, from Tuesday 6 April to Sunday 11 April 2021. The forum will allow each of our international experts to discover and select the lines presented by the competition's designers."" This format is similar to that devised by the organisers of the ITS competition, in Trieste, which was held entirely online in 2020. 
 
Applications can be made exclusively through the dedicated lvmhprize.com website. The competition is open to international designers who are under 40 years old and have produced at least two womenswear, menswear or gender-neutral collections.The winner will take away a prize of 300,000 euros, while the receiver of the special Karl Lagerfeld Prize will claim 150,000 euros. In both cases, the awardees will receive one year of mentoring from LVMH's teams. As usual, the luxury conglomerate will also give awards to three young fashion school graduates leaving their respective institutions in 2020 or 2021. 

Since its launch, the LVMH Prize has spotlighted a number of designers who have gone on to show on some of the most prestigious runways around the world, such as Paris and London. Past success stories include the prize's 2019 winner, Thebe Magugu, Marine Serre (2017), Jacquemus (special prize 2015), Rokh (special prize 2018), Grace Wales Bonner (2016), and Marques'Almeida (2015).

In 2020, the LVMH Prize decided to award its eight finalists – Ahluwalia, Casablanca, Chopova Lowena, Nicholas Daley, Peter Do, Sindiso Khumalo, Tomo Koizumi, and Supriya Lele – mentoring and a prize of 40.000 euros. The competition also created a fund dedicated to supporting the winners of its six previous editions, in order to bolster the development of their brands in the face of the economic difficulties caused by the pandemic.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 9, 2021","Two Paris Fashion Weeks scheduled for this month – menswear and haute couture – will not feature any live runway shows, after the government informed the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode that audiences attending any catwalk show would be in breach of the rules of the current Covid-19 restrictions on public gatherings. 
The decision emerged after discussions between the Préfecture de Police in Paris and the Fédération, which informed the participating houses of the decision on Friday.
 
It also follows the latest address from French Prime Minister Jean Castex on Thursday evening, January 7, in which he emphasized that restrictions would remain in place in France. Restaurants, cinemas and ski resorts have been closed since December as the country struggles to slow down the Covid-19 pandemic.Nonetheless, the Fédération insists the seasons will continue, albeit overwhelmingly online. 
 
""Yes, we can confirm that there cannot be any public gatherings at any fashion show. But our two Paris Fashion Weeks are going ahead and we remain very optimistic for both the menswear season and haute couture,"" insisted the Fédération’s executive president Pascal Morand.
 
He added that many houses were still deciding on the exact format of their shows, but stressed that houses could still present shows with models on the web, though behind closed doors.
 
""Fashion maisons are also allowed to organize professional RDVs and presentations, naturally respecting the rules about the number of people in any given space,"" he added.
 
""We still  in France and we have to remember that. This is a decision that comes from the government and prefecture and we will naturally respect that also,"" Morand added.
 
""It does make everything very complicated but we have planned to go ahead. We have a state-of-the-art platform, where people can see every collection on the web. So, everything is in place for it to work,"" he said.
 
Paris had already published significant schedules of shows, highlighting the desire of many houses to present collections. As noted, the menswear season is scheduled to be staged from Tuesday, January 19 to Sunday, January 24, while the haute couture season will take place between Monday, January 25 and Thursday, January 28. 
 
All told, there are 71 houses listed on the menswear calendar, including such powerhouse marques as Louis Vuitton, Dior Homme and Hermès, along with influential designer brands as Yohji Yamamoto, Rick Owens, Dries Van Noten, Vetements, Paul Smith, Loewe and Thom Browne. The couture calendar features 32 houses, such as Chanel, Armani Privé and Jean Paul Gaultier.
 
Reacting to the news, a spokeswoman for Hermès noted that many houses had not made any final decision about staging until after hearing Prime Minister Castex's speech.
 
""There will be no défilés in Paris this month. We have been informed. It’s official,"" the Hermès spokeswoman said.
 
Last season, Hermès menswear designer Véronique Nichanian staged a live online event, a mock look book shoot inside the brand’s headquarters, successfully showcasing a cool patrician collection.

""This time we will do a video. We are still working on that. But exactly how is still a secret,"" the spokeswoman added.
 
Christian Dior has two shows on the calendars: Dior Homme and Dior couture. Asked about the house’s plans, a spokesman responded: ""There can be no live show. This is the choice that has been made. It’s unfortunate, but it’s true. And naturally we will respect that decision. It’s force majeure due to the pandemic. So, expect to see a digital fashion show.""
 
Experts in France are warning of a coming surge in infections in the wake of extensive family travel over the Christmas break.

Restaurants will remain closed until at least mid-February and ski resorts are not expected to open before the February holidays. A nightly curfew will be extended until at least January 20 and further national restrictions could not be ruled out, Castex said Thursday. 

France is still reporting over 20,000 new cases daily of Covid-19 this week, still very far from the government's target of fewer than 5,000 daily infections. 

The Fédération has been working closely with the Préfecture, especially since the terrorist attacks of November 2015. Security is tight at any major show, and plain clothes detectives attend many Paris catwalks events.
 
""We are in contact with Préfecture regularly. It’s like being partners. The one thing we will never compromise is public safety. There can be no question of putting anyone at risk,"" stressed Morand.

"Jan 8, 2021","Y/Project is changing its strategy. The designer label, which has been led by Glenn Martens since 2013, has resolved to slow down the rhythm of its collections. As at other houses, the Covid-19 crisis has had an impact on the decision, but it is not the only factor being taken into consideration. Along with the pandemic-induced pause for thought concerning the evolution of the fashion industry and the company itself, the brand has undoubtedly had to take another significant element into account: the fact that the timetable of its Belgian designer has become a lot busier since he took over as creative director of Diesel last October. ""Glenn Martens has decided to break with the intense rhythm of four runway shows a year, in order to allow more time for creativity and experimentation. As of the Fall/Winter 2021/22 season, Y/Project will combine its men's and womenswear into a single collection, which will be presented in January and June, during Paris Fashion Week Men's,"" announced the house in a release. 
 
""In order to better protect our company and the fashion that we love, we have taken the decision to no longer follow the extreme rhythm of four runway shows a year,"" explained the brand's creative director. ""By freeing up more time, this period of six months between each show will give my team more freedom to explore, more time to perfect the surprising creations that you expect from us.""""During this year of pandemic, I have reflected on the essential reasons for our existence. My team and I take enormous pleasure in experimenting, constantly pushing concepts further and further, developing all of our patterns in house, challenging aesthetic codes by pushing boundaries and transcending limits. We create clothes that question what is expected and accepted, and we celebrate craftsmanship and creativity,"" continued Martens, highlighting that Y/Project ""has never aimed to be a 'standard' fashion brand, or to create clothes only to respond to the expectations of certain markets.""

The launch of the brand's first coed collection, which seeks to be ""more sustainable and even more ambitious,"" will take place online, on Sunday, 24 January, at 4 PM, and will be presented both on the label's own website and on Paris Fashion Week's digital platform.

"Jan 6, 2021","As Denmark transitions to its highest Covid-19 alert level, Copenhagen Fashion Week has announced that this February’s edition will be a fully digital event, while the city’s trade fairs have been cancelled. 
The announcement comes shortly after a briefing on Tuesday, during which Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen revealed that the country would be moving into the highest level of the national government’s five-tier Covid-19 alert scale.
 
All shows and talks featured on the Copenhagen Fashion Week programme will therefore take place as scheduled, from 2 to 4 February, but will now be presented via a dedicated digital platform, set to launch on 14 January.The event’s runway schedule, which features the likes of Ganni, Baum und Pferdgarten, Gestuz, Samsøe & Samsøe, Rotate Birger Christensen, and Stine Goya, has already been published, while the programme of talks will, according to the fashion week’s organisers, be revealed in mid-January.
 
Although Copenhagen Fashion Week has been able to adapt to tightened coronavirus restrictions with an alternative format, other industry events scheduled to take place in the Danish capital next month will be forced to skip this season. With all trade fairs banned in Denmark until the end of February 2021, both the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair (CIFF) and the Revolver trade show, which were supposed to run from 3 to 5 February, have had to cancel.
 
“Due to the current development of Covid-19, we have been forced to cancel all physical events this time, including the trade fairs,” explained Copenhagen Fashion Week CEO Cecilie Thorsmark in a release. “Even though it is definitely unwished-for, it is undeniably the right thing to do, and instead we look forward to being able to meet physically again for the August 2021 fashion week.”
 
Last summer, Copenhagen was one of a number of fashion weeks, including Paris, Milan, London and New York, to experiment with a hybrid “phygital” format, allowing brands to participate with either physical or digital presentations.
 
The fashion week’s decision to opt for a fully digital calendar this season follows discussions with CIFF, Revolver, Dansk Fashion & Textile, and Danish fashion association WEAR, and received approval from all parties involved in these talks.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 23, 2020","Adidas has announced a new long-term partnership with Jerry Lorenzo's Fear of God. As part of the partnership, Lorenzo, the founder and owner of the luxury streetwear brand, will drive the creative and business strategy for Adidas basketball globally. The deal will also solidify the establishment and formation of the third pillar of the Fear of God house, Fear of God Athletics. The new pillar will focus on performance basketball and active lifestyle products that complete Fear of God’s triune nature and compliments the brand's other two pillars, Essentials and Fear of God’s luxury mainline, Adidas said. 

""This is a fearless move where shared vision and conviction are at the heart of the accretion of two brands shaping sports and culture, with the purpose to truly multiply our nuanced strengths to revolutionize the performance basketball industry forever,"" Lorenzo said.""Adidas and Fear of God share the same dream for the future of basketball, on and beyond the court, and we look forward to changing the face of the industry through a new model that will unfold before us in the coming years."" 

“The global impact that Jerry Lorenzo and Fear of God has had on culture and the industry is undeniable,"" added Brian Grevy, Adidas executive board member responsible for global brands. 

""[Lorenzo] is a creative visionary and embodies a true expression of the entrepreneurial spirit today. Jerry’s authentic connection to sport, deep understanding of the footwear industry and past, and ability to reinterpret heritage and visualize the future excites us. We look forward to working with him to inspire the next generation of basketball creatives, athletes and communities.”

The partnership comes as the global activewear market is projected to reach $353.5 billion this year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on retail, according to a recent report from Spanish investment firm Comprar Acciones.

"Dec 22, 2020","Almost last but very definitely not least, Junya Watanabe unveiled his latest menswear ideas in a handsome book this week, one of the final collections to be presented in 2020, in the never-ending fashion season caused by Covid-19. 
This arty yet earthy collection would surely have looked powerful on any catwalk; it certainly looks great in his book, entitled Co-ordination Manual Junya Watanabe Comme des Garçons Man.
 
Photographed in various Japanese cities by photographer Keizo Kitajima, it features a series of 13 gutsy characters from samurai sword-makers and auto mechanics to DJs and barmen, all captured at or near work.
 
And all done up proudly in the quirky yet classy style that is the signature of Watanabe. Like professional fly fisherman Yutaro Sugisaka, casting his rod proudly in the Kansa river in scratchy print waterproof jerkin. Eat your heart out Brad Pitt. Or bonsai master Masashi Hirao strolling the countryside in an erratically saddled stitched denim jacket. Each image referencing a certain book.
 “This season I found myself reflecting on the power of the books around me - precious items that I value, though I may not open them every day. Many of the pieces in this collection depict and introduce these books,” said Watanabe.
 
A cast of authentically weathered yet noble faces in a collection that also included broken script print cotton jackets; grandfather shirts with pop art motifs; patchwork distressed linen blazers and great kicking fabric jackets worn by the mechanics in their oily garage.
 
Very much a designer’s designer, Watanabe traditionally stages small, tightly packed shows in Paris, which are very much cult events for fashion aficionados. His backstage is often off limits and when it is open Junya rarely speaks much, never mind giving an interview.

But this season in his book, he even provided a further quote: “I hope this letter finds you well. For the Spring Summer season I am presenting the Junya Watanabe Comme des Garçons Man collection in a book entitled Manual. Please find it enclosed here. Thank you for all your support – I do hope you enjoy it. Best regards, Junya Watanabe.”

"Dec 21, 2020","Inspiration for high fashion can come from strange places. For one Taiwanese designer, it’s upcycling old wires and bolts from the power industry.Wang Li-ling, 36, scours dumps, picking up old bits of metal and wires from Taiwan’s main electricity supplier to add extra flair to her clothes.

“For example, there’s quite a lot of material from Taipower that they have phased out,” Wang told Reuters in her studio.“These materials have been used for more than 20 or 30 years. At least more than 10 years. So their colour or the mottled feeling they give you is different from new material.”

The wires and other materials are stitched onto dresses and other items of clothing, giving them a futuristic feeling, and drawing a warm reception at a fashion show in Taipei on Friday.

“Actually, it is my first time seeing a Taiwan fashion designer turning recycled things into new ideas,” said Taiwanese lifestyle influencer Andrew Chen, who was at the show.

“Everyone knows the fashion industry is about fast fashion. And it is wasteful. It expanded my horizons today that I saw how to use old materials to create something new, and then present it with creativity.”

A popular destination for trendy tourists in pre-coronavirus times, Taiwan has an up-and-coming fashion scene, whose designers are starting to make an impact on the world stage.

With many global events shuttered or moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan put on Taipei Fashion Week in October featuring live shows, a testament to the island’s successful efforts to control the spread of the illness.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Dec 21, 2020","Think of Valentino’s brand-new brand experience in Shanghai as the ultimate in semiotic chic from the Italian house staged in China’s biggest boomtown.

Entitled “Valentino: Re-signify Part One Shanghai,” it’s a multi-disciplinary display of photography, fine art,  film and fashion in an exhibition designed as “a revision of the signs and codes of maison Valentino,” according to Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of the Rome-based house.Roland Barthes couldn’t have put it any better.

“It’s about keeping the codes of the house open for today; and being be relevant for today. It’s more an experience than an exhibition, connecting the codes of Valentino to art and underground cinema.  It’s about sharing a sensibility and not a lifestyle,” explained Piccioli to FashionNetwork.com on a Zoom call from Rome.

“We wanted an open project and a beginning of a different perspective. Opening our house to another world. Beginning with the birth of the house in 1960 to the very first Valentino red dress and arriving at accessories from the atelier, all the way to red carpet and daywear,” added Piccioli.

Re-signify is being staged in the city’s hottest new art institution, Power Station of Art, the site of the Shanghai Biennale, from December 19 to January 17. The space is divided up into galleries, chambers, a library, a Dungeon club and even an Empathy Room.

“Shanghai is a very far away culture. Our past much is less known in China than in Europe and the US, so it is great to present this concept in Shanghai,” said the designer, explaining the choice of location.

Highlights include Cao Pei’s video installation COSPlayers, where art cosplay bohemians meet Power Rangers; to Robby Müller’s multiple Polaroids, reimagined with back projections; to images of the house’s nerve centre in Rome, Palazzo Mignanelli.While the library contains triangulations of the house’s varied archives – from Stanley Mouse Haight Ashbury visions and Sølve Sundsbø’s graphic photography to prints by founder Valentino Garvin or the Diary campaign shot by Piccioli.
All the way to a central Piazza, where a video shot by Nick Knight of hyper elongated haute couture dresses from the fall/winter 2020 collection, first seen in a phygital show in Cinecitta this summer,  are projected. While scaffolding allows visitors to approach the out-of-scale dresses.

All the way to the Dungeon, replete with studs, the defining emblem of Valentino under Piccioli, and a meeting of what he calls “a distinctive and recurring feature that redefines and identifies today’s Valentino style, combining classical Rome with the rebelliousness of underground culture.”

Whole walls are covered in the house’s iconic rock-stud high heels, mules and sandals, set before silver mirror multi panel walls and images of studded Renaissance palaces in Rome.

“Ten years ago we first had the ideas of punkness to create a very important break in the codes of the house. And now in rules of the romance which you are seeing today. Our shoes can be seen as punk, but you also see rock studs on any Roman door. And Valentino is the only Roman couture house,” smiles the 53-year-old Piccioli, whose modern romantic style has been hugely influential in fashion the past half-decade.

He hopes to take a variant of this brand celebration – curated by Mariuccia Casadio and Jacopo Bedussi - on tour, though has not yet decided on the next location. The expo marks the first major event by Valentino in Shanghai since its epic runway show staged in a former cruise liner station on the Huangpu river, which coincided with the opening of a 700 square-meter flagship in the city centre.

China remains a vital market for Valentino, which a year ago opened another flagship in China, the hipster district of Sanlitun in Beijing. However, after several years of rapid growth, business has been sluggish internationally for the brand. Turnover in 2019 saw a tepid rise of 2.4% to €1.223 billion, leading to the departure of long-time CEO Stefano Sassi and his replacement by Jacopo Venturini in June.

Staged in the Danish capital, the season opens with the noted Swedish menswear brand Schnayderman's, led by Creative Director Hampus Bernhoff, on Tuesday morning and ends with the region’s single most acclaimed independent designer, Denmark’s Henrik Vibskov, on Thursday evening.""We are happy to present a very strong line up of 33 brands for this season who will be presenting their upcoming AW21 collection in a variety of innovative formats adapted to the times we are in. Like last edition, this fashion week will uphold all regulations to concur a safe experience for our physical guests and an extraordinary connective experience for our digital guests,” said Cecilie Thorsmark, CEO of Copenhagen Fashion Week, in a release.

Expect a collation of digital showcases supported by a selection of physical shows, staged in light of recent new Covid-19 restrictions in Denmark. This week, Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen ordered a second national lockdown from Christmas Day as cases of coronavirus continue to spiral.

The country has also be rocked by Frederiksen’s decision to cull 17 million mink, after they became infected with Covid – an unfortunately botched project that led to lorry loads of mink escaping into the countryside, and buried mink potentially contaminating drinking supplies.Nonetheless, the season will feature a string lineup - with such happening brands as Ganni, from a husband and wife team that now retails in over 400 doors worldwide and Marimekko, the print-driven Finnish lifestyle brand. Along with Designer’s Nest, a fashion incubator for young local talent; and the London-based hipster label Rixo by Henrietta Rix and Orlagh McCloskey. A slew of local Scandi houses have also returned to the season - Rotate Birger Christensen, House of Dagmar, Wood Wood and Stand Studio – bolstering Copenhagen Fashion Week.

""We are very excited to be part of the coming edition of Copenhagen Fashion Week. This is the first time that we are showing on an official schedule as we believe Copenhagen Fashion Week is a great platform to reach both a Scandinavian as well as an international audience. We are also very impressed by how Copenhagen Fashion Week has adapted quickly to the current climate, mixing digital and physical formats in a progressive way,” said Schnayderman's Bernhoff.

Finally, organizers announced the finalists for the Zalando Sustainability Award, a new addition to Copenhagen Fashion Week's sustainability goals, spotlighting three brands making exceptional steps in their sustainable efforts. This season, the international jury that includes Arizona Muse and Global Fashion Agenda's CSO Morten Lehman selected Marimekko, Danish designer Louise Lyngh Bjerregaard and the Swedish brand House of Dagmar as the three finalists.

"Dec 18, 2020","Not a great deal appears to have changed since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. In January 2021, the fashion weeks will start off their seasonal marathon again, and will be chiefly staged virtually, as they were for their last summer sessions.

The Milan Fashion Week Men is scheduled on January 15-19 and will again feature a hybrid format, with a mix of digital and physical events, and the same number of participating labels as in the summer, 37. The announcement was made on Thursday by Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian Fashion Chamber, in a video conference.Five labels will stage genuine physical catwalk shows, and seven new names - presenting their menswear (and womenswear too for some) collections for the Fall/Winter 2021-22 - are included on the official Milanese calendar, which features about 10 presentations each day. 

As they did in recent editions of the Milan Fashion Week, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and Etro will stage physical shows. K-Way and Korean label Solid Homme by designer Woo Young Mi, both showing for the first time in Milan, are the other two names on the physical show list.The other debut labels on the Milanese calendar are Italy-based Moldovan designer Dina Leu, who won the menswear prize at this year’s Who’s On Next competition; emerging label Vaderetro, created in 2019 by designer duo Hanna Boyer and Antonio D'Andrea; Dalpaos, by talented emerging designer Nicola D’Alpaos; New Delhi-based Indian designer and entrepreneur Dhruv Kapoor; and Tokyo James, the label by Nigerian-born British designer Ineyie Tokyo James.All the top Italian fashion names are of course on the calendar, like Ermenegildo Zegna, which will stage the fashion week's opening event on Friday January 15, followed by Les Hommes. Prada, Tod’s and MSGM will follow suit on Sunday January 17. Some labels are mulling whether to take part in the January fashion week or in the February one, presenting their men’s and women’s collections together.

As in July, the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) will deploy a website dedicated to the event with plenty of content. Besides featuring the official calendar and the labels’ video presentations, the site will also give access to pages with various conferences and interviews. Each participating label will also have its own digital showroom on the site.

"Dec 15, 2020","The house of Saint Laurent returned to Morocco, the home away from home and frequent source of inspiration of its founder Yves, and the setting for a stylish and succinct collection by its current creative director Anthony Vaccarello. 
The designer unveiled his latest ideas Tuesday afternoon in a video entitled I Wish You Were Here, filmed amid the undulating ridges in the Sahara desert with tremendous élan.
 
Drone shots set the scene with the house’s legendary YSL logo beautifully carved 10 meters long into a Saharan hillside.  The youthful cast almost miraculously marching along a sand runway sculpted on a curving ridge – in boots and high heels from early morning until twilight. His opening look: cropped hair in peroxide blonde with the strictest of belted military jackets, its collar finished with a pink metal cactus flower, worn over rider shorts walking moodily over the sand dunes.
 
Sheer tops and lots of chiffon tunics finished with caribou feathers; worn on a cast many of whom sported hair all shorn away at the side. The sky varying from pale cyan blue to a mottled azure in the background, as a red-haired Nicole Kidman lookalike marched sultrily in a sleeveless jumpsuit. A pencil-thin silhouette throughout.
 
Mica Argañaraz at her moodiest best in a black belted jumpsuit with large white collar blouse; followed by some great mini tuxes and mess jackets; one gal in just a mannish wool waistcoat and pants.
 
Everything smartly accessorized by some striking body art – cactus flowers, oversized insects, chunky crystal pendants - by Claude Lalanne, the remarkable jeweler who passed away in April 2019. A close friend of Yves, for whom she created a sculptural bar in his Paris apartment, she went on to write a famous page in fashion history - the stunning bronze bust modelled in 1969 by uber-beauty Veruschka.
 
Practically all the looks in mono-color except for floral pants, earrings and a superb caftan worn on a black model, recalling the great black models of Yves, like Katoucha Niane and Mounia. A reminder that long before inclusion was buzz word in fashion, Yves and the house of Saint Laurent were championing diversity by having the most multiracial casting of models of any catwalk.
 
“I wanted to focus on the essence of things. I think it’s a sign of the times. But I didn’t want anything bleak or heavy. The desert, to me, symbolizes that yearn for serenity, open space, a slower rhythm. The clothes are also softer, the spirit of the collection is more gentle (sic), stripped back,” explained Vaccarello in cryptic program note.
 
The house of Saint Laurent skipped the last Paris runway season in September, announcing that it will in future show in varied and different cities. Since then, its one collection display was a high-energy video that went online before the Paris shows of menswear shot on young guys dashing around famous global locations from Montmartre to the Great Wall of China. Like today’s video, the menswear video was shot by Nathalie Canguilhem and electro DJ Sebastian.
 
Synth-pop background music again courtesy of Sebastian in the Sahara as the female cast appeared magically out of the vast expanse in pony skin coats; four-pocket jackets; short leather cocktails with chauffeur’s tunic tops; and tights topped by lacey underwear and sheer shirts.
 
For his finale, Vaccarello set his runway on fire, the flames illuminating the cast as they strode off into the desert night. Almost following the spirt of Yves, off to his final resting place in the Majorelle Gardens of Marrakech, where his ashes were scattered amid the palms and giant cacti of his walled oasis.

"Dec 14, 2020","There is the calm before the storm, and then there is the party after the pandemic.
 
Christian Dior released the lookbook and video of its Pre-Fall 2021 collection on Monday and these are definitely not clothes for blushing violets. Clearly the house of Dior expects the good times to roll by in the second half of next year. That much was evident from the opening looks; a perfectly cut three-button bar jacket but made in a brown leopard print paired with a lace blouse and multiple chain necklaces; or chain mail pop art minis worn with fishnet tights, worthy of a latter day French Ye-Ye singer. All styled far more for after hours than cocktail hours.
 
Before heading out on the prowl, these Dior ladies don enormous black sunglasses worthy of Jackie Onassis escaping Ron Galella; chain belts shown over lots of exposed tummy; and scores of mini dragon pendants and pearl baubles.The collection’s starting point was actually a vintage leopard print Dior trench coat designed back in the '50s, a reiteration of fur coats and accessories much favored by Mizza Bricard, one of Monsieur Dior’s most legendary muses, and the woman said to have invented the term Miss Dior.  A lady, it was said, who never rose from her bed before 2 p.m., and always dressed in animal prints and pearls.
 “I felt that her remarkable character, her inimitable extravagances of taste, would have an excellent effect on the phlegmatic temperament which I had inherited from my Norman forebears,” Monsieur Dior would write about Mizza in his autobiography.
 
And just like Bricard, Dior’s creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri is not afraid to jumble up eras and ideas, which she does to great effect for Fall 2021. Chiuri even dipped back into her own Italian youth with the shiny happy insouciance of Fiorucci. An influence apparent in the brilliant new take on the Oblique print, seen in a see-through plastic cape with hood. Or also with silver jumpsuits; saucy silver minis with CD buttons or silver jockey caps worthy of another influence on Chiuri’s thinking - the K-pop all-female group Black Pink. The biggest girl band sensation on the planet since the Spice Girls or TLC, Black Pink became the most subscribed group on YouTube in September 2019. The group’s lead singer Jisoo is already an ambassador of Dior and featured in the launch of Dior’s new Bobby Bag.
 
“Fashion cannot solve the problems of the world, but it can help create more optimism. Yes, ours is complicated work, especially now in this year. But sometimes we need to see fashion as a game, that needs to be played for the pure enjoyment,” argued Chiuri in a pre-show Zoom with editors.
 
And even when Maria Grazia whips up a millefleurs motif brocade frock, she shows it splayed open at the front with a contrast dyed green lace bra apparent. Her self-assured contemporary heroines appear in black leather plissé minis; and lace shirts worn underneath S&M leather bustiers, topped by Parisian berets. Adding to the sense of fun, Chiuri requested Maripol, the famed chronicler of the 1980s downtown New York art and music sense, to shoot much of the collection on Polaroid, giving the atmosphere tremendous kick. It was as if the ghost of the Mudd Club backrooms had made it all the way to Dior’s Avenue Montaigne boutique. Club couture with embroideries adorned with dangling sequins or mirror discs with a stroboscopic surface.Call it a youthquake at Dior, as Chiuri captures the joie de vivre of growing up, and the sense that fashion offers endless possibilities for individuals to reinvent themselves.
 
Throughout there was also a mixed cross current of ideas from Richard Hamilton’s surrealist English pop to the Day-Glo cartoon iconography of Marco Lodola to Andy Warhol’s psychedelic revamp of  Renaissance master Paolo Uccello, and his legendary image of St George and the Dragon. Adding a certain grandeur to the groove.
 
Reflecting on the past year, Chiuri recalled her last life runway show for Dior in a tent in the Tuileries in September, as “a pretty surreal experience. To see an empty backstage is very strange. To see the city of Paris empty too. Because cities are not built to be empty… Coming to work, it’s still very quiet day by day. Nor do we know  what’s going to happen with the couture show. Yes, we are creating the collection but let’s see about the show; who knows?
 
“In the studio we have had ups and downs. Yes, sometimes great enthusiasm, but then not. Let’s be frank,  fashion is not what it was – especially this year. The system was often attacked, even by ourselves. But fashion is also a new form of humanity. Coming from the need to use clothes to change ourselves. We should be honest about that. I’ve seen so much criticism of our sector, but I like to remember that here at Dior we create beauty,” Chiuri concluded.
 
Though developed in the pandemic, the collection will begin retailing in May, “if all goes well,” she added.

"Dec 10, 2020","Few creators have created as distinctive a body of work as Jil Sander, generally regarded as the greatest minimalist fashion designer in history.Her refined forms; obsessive use of subtle detailing; insistence on tactile fabrics and innate understanding of the human form have allowed her to build a unique body of work in a career that has now spanned five decades.

Sander’s latest expression is her new collaboration with Uniqlo called +J, which reviews a link-up she first made with the Japanese retailing giant back in 2010. The collection – for men and women – debuted last month in Germany, but due to the global lockdown has only gradually begun to appear in Uniqlo flagships internationally.Though born in Wesselburen, in a military hospital near the North Sea, Jil founded her own fashion house in 1968 in Hamburg, even using her mother’s sewing machine.  She immediately gained a reputation for her ability to dress clever and sophisticated women in an understated yet patrician style; before successfully launching her company on the stock market in 1989. By 1999, when the house had revenues in excess of $200 million, she initiated a joint venture with Prada, before both retiring and returning to her brand twice, and then seemingly laying down her scissors for good in 2013. Until that is Uniqlo came calling again.

Independently, Sander had also created her own fashion consultancy and her first client was Fast Retailing, for whose Uniqlo division she developed the first +J collection a decade ago.So, this latest 2020 collection from Jil Sander for Uniqlo offers fans the chance to acquire clothes that are both cerebral and sophisticated at a price that causes little pain at the cash register. It features simple yet superb dark down parkas; refined mannish shirts and hyper professional blazers for women; and classy cardigans with droplet spots; ideal light blue work shirts and gentlemanly chester topcoats for men.

Which is why we caught up with the legendarily discreet Frau Sander - the greatest living designer in Mitteleuropa - to learn a little more about her dreams for this collab and for fashion; her view on today’s fashion shows and her opinion of her ultimate successors at the house of Jil Sander.


FashionNetwork.com: Why did you want to create this collection with Uniqlo?
Jil Sander: I wanted to react to disposable fashion with a collection of high quality and contemporary 3D shapes at democratic prices.

FNW: What do you enjoy most about working with Uniqlo?
JS: I am impressed by Uniqlo’s buying power, logistics, and global distribution network. The possibility to reach many people all over the world makes me happy. Uniqlo supports me in my vision of sophisticated modern uniforms for everyone, regardless of class and ethnic differences.

FNW: What did you want to do differently this time compared to your previous collaboration?
JS: The mood this time around was very different which is reflected in more generous, soft and protective silhouettes. Also, the collection was to be quite concentrated. Creatively, it was a real challenge not to lose the content in reducing and to achieve a whole instead of just separate parts.

FNW: People have been queuing outside Uniqlo stores in Berlin to buy +J . How does it feel to still have such influence in fashion?
JS: I was surprised and impressed by the queues, since they implied that I haven’t been forgotten. Maybe the moment was right to offer a design which looks for purity and tries to be truly contemporary.FNW: I believe you are working on a book project. What sort of book are you planning?
JS: The book is meant to put my life’s work into perspective, to show how all my efforts were inspired by the same attitude and the same vision.

FNW: Do you miss staging runway shows yourself?
JS: Lately, shows have turned into big events. But in the last year, due to the pandemic, it was very difficult to stage this kind of format, and people worked on new creative ways to present their work. I always tried to be very precise in my fashion shows and to focus on the actual wearability. But I am open to different possibilities, and with +J, we followed a low-key virtual presentation which was okay with me.

FNW: People generally describe your style as minimalist. Do you think that does justice to what you create?
JS: Myself, I never speak of minimalism. For me, it relates to certain tendencies in art and architecture. But if you work on the human body, there is a limit to reduction. I want to create clothes that highlight the individual, and the process to get there can be very complex. The final outcome for me is purity, the impression that the wearer is in harmony with his or her body, with their dignity, and also with their times.

FNW: If you are going to be remembered for a single great contribution to fashion, what would you like it to be?
JS: I would like an overall vision to be remembered. My approach to fashion is my approach to life.  I believe in changing things for the better and to co-design the present moment in order to do so.  I also believe in discarding things that no longer have any meaning. I want my work to be relevant and help us focus on the future.FNW: You created a museum show in Frankfurt, do you plan any others and where?
JS: Right now, because of the pandemic, all talk about exhibitions is off. But in the future, I would like the exhibition to travel.

FNW: Since you quit designing collections annually, you devoted a good deal of time to gardening. What’s the biggest difference between designing a garden and designing fashion?
JS: The difference is not so great. A garden is constantly changing, and you have to adapt to new conditions and create new harmonies. The same goes for social and cultural changes. You get tired of things past and crave new cuts, proportions and textile solutions.

FNW: What does it feel seeing the collections of Luke and Lucie Meier for Jil Sander?
JS: I am glad to see that Jil Sander is in their able hands.

FNW: Who are the other designers you admire, both in the past and today, and why?
JS: There are many designers I am interested in, but I prefer not to name them individually.

"Dec 10, 2020","Pantone has named its new Color of the Year and has actually selected two with Pantone 17-5104 Ultimate Gray and 13-0647 Illuminating being “a marriage of colour, conveying a message of strength and hopefulness that is both enduring and uplifting”.The colour specialist said the two independent shades “highlight how different elements come together to support one another, [to] best express the mood for 2021”.

Illuminating is a bright and cheerful yellow “sparkling with vivacity, a warming yellow shade imbued with solar power”. And Ultimate Gray is “emblematic of solid and dependable elements. which are everlasting and provide a firm foundation. The colours of pebbles on the beach and natural elements whose weathered appearance highlights an ability to stand the test of time, Ultimate Gray quietly assures, encouraging feelings of composure, steadiness and resilience”.The combination is meant to be “practical and rock solid but at the same time warming and optimistic”, with a feeling of “strength and positivity. It is a story of colour that encapsulates deeper feelings of thoughtfulness with the promise of something sunny and friendly”.Clearly, this has all been influenced by the extraordinary events of this year globally and how “we need to feel that everything is going to get brighter”.

Pantone said people are seeking ways ""to fortify themselves with energy, clarity, and hope to overcome the continuing uncertainty”, which means that “spirited and emboldening shades satisfy our quest for vitality”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 7, 2020","It’s been a never-ending season in fashion in 2020 due to the pandemic, with designers unable to stage live runway shows and forced to create collection videos to highlight their latest ideas. One by-product is a lot of creative and personal video statements from talented designers,  few done more succinctly than Brandon Maxwell, who presented his Spring-Summer 2021 collection late Sunday night. 
Maxwell’s nine-minute video began with a show producer calling the cast to attention in a mock backstage, before a cast of 16 girls took to the backlit “runway.” Forget anything like pandemic loungewear. That is not something on Brandon’s radar. Instead, we witnessed a tremendous display of high-octane, all-American glamour, presented on a great cast – starring Lindsey Wixson, making a Brandon Maxwell show debut.
 
From a bitter lemon semi-sheer plissé cocktail or marvelous black moiré mini frock, to a superb pink faille spring coat worn by the beautiful Brionka Halbert; and revealing bias-cut jersey dress with huge slashes on Japanese stunner Chiharu Okunugi. Maxwell’s clothes can seem deceptively simple, but their precision cut and understanding of the human figure made every look appear very special – even in simple materials, like the flawlessly draped gray jersey dress worn by Jasmine Daniels.
 
Maxwell’s origins as a stylist apparent in his unerring eye for the latest in contemporary beauty. Every one of his cast uber-secure, staring straight into the camera or twirling around self-confidently to a moody opening soundtrack featuring Moby’s ballad This Wild Darkness.
 
All finished with small mountains of eyeliner and mega eyelashes in Roman purple and cobalt blue, courtesy of makeup master James Kaliardos; and bedecked with multi-strand golden chain bracelets; chunky necklaces and large loop earrings. Every second passage featuring belt-bags and transparent fanny-packs, as the show climaxed with Free Woman from Lady Gaga, who helped put Maxwell on the map when she named him her personal fashion director.Alongside the show video, Maxwell packaged a Making the SS21 Runway Experience video starting from car ride along the Hudson River to fittings in Pier 59 to the still photo set by Marla Weinhoff and runway set by John Torres. All the way to the designer calling the gals to order with his own mini megaphone.
 
Brandon termed this collection an exercise in “cleaning and clarifying” after a challenging year, where he felt transported back to his very first days in design. “It’s a representation of our path form dark to light. We are grateful to be joining you now with a renewed purpose and reality… Here’s to a bright and beautiful year.”
 
Maxwell originally came from Longview in east Texas, a small city of some 80,000, noted for producing multiple American football stars, but also two great thespians – Matthew McConaughey and Forest Whitaker – before he debuted his eponymous women’s collection in Mr Chow’s nightclub in New York five years ago.
 
Texans are known for their generosity, and Maxwell is no exception. When the bearded designer took his bow, dressed in grey hoodie and baseball cap; he showed off an Apple iPad featuring images of all his design team and backstage staff.
 
Four decades ago, when Dallas was the world’s first global soap opera, describing someone as a Texan fashion designer would have sounded like an oxymoron to anyone living in Milan or Paris. Not any more. That was before Tom Ford went on to become a superstar at Gucci; a status he has skilfully maintained ever since; and before the explosion of Brandon Maxwell onto the fashion firmament in New York.
 
“I hope you will be able to go into work and dream again. And I hope that the future of Brandon Maxwell is filled with dreams,” concluded Maxwell, as he drove – himself – around Manhattan.

"Dec 7, 2020","There are worse places to shoot a fashion video, especially during lockdown, than the white cliffs of England. 
And that’s the location for a bold video from the house of Alexander McQueen for its spring-summer 2021 menswear collection, a series of clothes largely made of stock fabric. Think rude-boy-meets-indie royalty.
 
The clip, shot at Newhaven in Sussex, and digital lookbook mark the latest online unveiling of an important collection from an influential runway brand in this year of the pandemic.
 
To her great credit, ever since she took over the reins of the house following the passing of the founder a decade ago, Sarah Burton has maintained Alexander McQueen as one of the dozen most influential bellwether fashion shows anywhere on the planet. In recent seasons, the brand has skipped the menswear catwalks and often shown by appointment to press and buyers in either an ex-factory showroom in the Navigli canal district of Milan or in a storied East London location. 
This year due to lockdown, the house’s latest menswear ideas come to us digitally. But despite the virtual connection this collection is unquestionably one of the best in menswear this year.
 
Bursting with ideas from its tightly structured tailoring to its Escher-like combinations of different garments. Like a poly-faille flight jacket that morphs into gentleman’s 19th century frack; or the natty New Wave suits finished with giant micro-faille bow lapels; to the stunning tuxedo meets Blade Runner spy coat.
 
All the way to the vertically divided meetings of grey parka and city gent wool coat; or a classic trench coat encountering a deer stalker’s tweed coat. Respecting the founder’s Scottish roots, an Aran fisherman’s wool intarsia waistcoat connected to gent’s dressing gown.
 
Though the most spectacular elements were the over-dyed double-breasted suits in denim blue and rose in drip-dyed and squidgy board prints. Finished with jewelled brooch embellishments; posh bovver boots and embroidery inspired by the studio team’s notebooks, this was cultured rock star glamour to the max, and a truly fresh fashion statement from Britain’s most important living designer.

"Dec 7, 2020","Balenciaga debuted a novel new runway show format on Sunday afternoon – though not a Paris catwalk, but instead in a customized video game named 'Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow'.
 
The game did require a rather long wait, as guests were greeted with the message: “Please wait to access the game (your queue number is above). Do not reload this page.” 
Duly warned, with cappuccino in hand, one attended patiently before entering Balenciaga’s Tomorrow. A digital clock listing your place in the queue. After gaining admission, the game’s architecture turned out to be a jumble of modernist boutique: concrete bunker, futurist Eldorado, and inner-city garden. 

Twiddling one’s thumbs led one on a tour of the boutique -- whose design echoed Balenciaga’s Paris flagship -- itself a former garage on the city's Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, with graphic flooring, high-gloss stainless steel shelves and techy hangers.Interspersed within the virtual world were models, mannequins and avatars wearing the Fall 2021 collection designed by Balenciaga’s creative director, Demna Gvasalia. In yet another power packed series of clothes from the Georgian designer: Oversized rock star bashed-up wool suits; crisp calico blazers; giant trenches that looked cut three sizes to large; massively wide shouldered spy coats – all finished with sleeves that ended at the finger tips.
  
Nearly all the cast wore elements of Arthurian armor – with metal greaves, sabatons and cuisses. Though all reimagined in a lacquered material much lighter than the traditional steel. Each model posing as if ready for a royal rumble in the Demna’s Age of Tomorrow game. After hours Lancelots of the Lake.

The collection had certainly oodles of kick and attitude. No designer does volume with as much credibility as Gvasalia, whose aesthetic manages to impart downtown cool, along with a sense of heroism.
 
Plus, fans of his logomania will find lots to acquire in this array - from white shirts with Balenciaga written as if for an oil can, to new NASA Balenciaga satchels. In fact, the highlight of the whole display were the silver astronaut parkas and blue NASA flight jackets.  
But, if the collection was a strong clear fashion statement, the virtual journey felt like a long-winded detour. Those of us old enough to have been alive when the last Catholic president - JFK – was in the White House will struggle with this convoluted video game. One kept on ending up in gray mortar backrooms or behind bushes. Quite what the pre-show trumpeted “allegory of 2031” was exactly very hard to fathom. 
 
But, one should praise the house for at least attempting a new format in the midst of the pandemic, when entire fashion runway seasons were forced to cancel. 
 
Besides, King Arthur, and Cristobal, probably would have liked the clothes very much. They were that good.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 4, 2020","Tod’s has announced plans to present the first fruits of its Tod’s Academy project linking up with students from Central Saint Martins during London Fashion Week in February. 
A total of 33 young designers, selected by Central Saint Martins, have been busy working on their own interpretations of one or more of Tod's codes, which they will unveil in two months during the UK season.
 
The concept, which was conceived by Tod’s chairman and controlling shareholder Diego Della Valle and coordinated by Fabio Piras, course director of Central St. Martins MA Fashion Course, will be presented in a digital exhibition.
 
“Growing up in such a unique time, our new generation of creatives must be supported and promoted. In this spirit, Tod's announces the collaboration… a special project in which young creativity dialogues with Tod's values and expresses itself totally freely,” the Italian luxury marque explained in a release.
 
As part of the process, each participant was assigned a “fashion master,” from a selection of international editors, journalists and designers to help and enrich the students. So, February will also reveal how these mentors have performed.

"Dec 3, 2020","The British Fashion Council unveiled its newly-digital Fashion Awards on Thursday evening and instead of just replacing the usual live event with an online version, it changed the format completely to reflect the momentous change that’s happening at present.Instead of recognising the top designers in various categories, in a digital film premiere and in four groups, it hailed the 20 individuals and brands “who led change in the fashion industry in 2020”.

The Creativity group was a roll call of major names, both long-established and newer to the industry. They included Graces Wales Bonner for “her designs [that] continue to evoke the rich history of African culture and challenge the gender norms of Black male masculinity and identity”.Also on the list was Jonathan Anderson who “redefined the possibilities of what a show can be with Covid-19 restrictions by pioneering show-in-a-box and show-on-the-wall concepts for both JW Anderson and Loewe. The collections were a defiant celebration of fashion and craft, impeccable quality and attention to details”.

Kim Jones made the grade for creativity that “knows no boundaries and each new collection both surprises and intrigues”. And the Prada label, plus Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, were also honoured for “the power of creativity and the importance of conversation and coming together to reimagine fashion for the future”.

Last but not least in this group, Riccardo Tisci and Burberry were awarded for Tisci’s “extraordinary creative thinking teamed with Burberry's core values of inclusivity and sustainability [that] reaffirm the brand's position as a global creative powerhouse and leader of change”. The BFC also highlighted innovative use of technology.Then there was the Environment category that included Anya Hindmarch, who “has dedicated extensive time and effort into research and development to help reduce waste in fashion's supply chain”; Christopher Raeburn who “has championed sustainable practices to build a responsible business while being a fantastic spokesperson for how things can be done differently without sacrificing creativity”; Gabriela Hearst who “redefined modern luxury by championing luxury with integrity”; Stella McCartney, described as “the industry trailblazer for sustainable practices in fashion”; and The Fashion Pact that has almost doubled its signatories in the last year, bringing together 60+ leading companies to drive sustainability in fashion.

The next group was Community and this also featured some diverse names such as A Sai Ta, who’s ""part of a new generation of East Asian designers who reflect on their culture through a uniquely British lens with a brand message of Actively Standing Against Injustice”. Chanel was honoured too, for its contribution to positive change and enriching the communities in which it actively participates. In response to the pandemic, it made significant charitable donations, manufactured PPR and focused on cutting its carbon footprint.Bethany Williams, Cozette McCreary, Holly Fulton and Phoebe English, were recognised for setting up the Emergency Designer Network in response to the pandemic and helping create PPE. And Kenneth Ize was chosen for his support of the communities of weavers, artisans and design groups across Nigeria and of the LGBTQIA+ community through his work.

The final name in this group, Michael Halpern, was hailed for his tribute at London Fashion Week to frontline health workers and his contribution to the production of PPE.

Finally, the People category recognised those “who have led change by encouraging equal, diverse, empowered workforces from head office to supply chain and shop floor”.They included Aurora James for her efforts to “bring change to the fashion industry through her campaign for systemic change to promote black-owned businesses and through her traditional design practices”; Vogue Editor Edward Enninful “for his outstanding contribution to diversity” through the magazine; Lindsay Peoples Wagner and Sandrine Charles for the Black in Fashion Council group of editors, models, stylists, media executives, creatives and industry stakeholders aiming to bring diversity, inclusion and accountability to the industry; Priya Ahluwalia for her work in pioneering sustainable fashion while telling the stories of those who make her clothes and the communities she works with; and Samuel Ross who created the Black Lives Matter Financial Aid Scheme.

The awards for Community were presented by Priyanka Chopra Jonas, the awards for People by Lewis Hamilton, the awards for Environment by Aja Barber and Maisie Williams, and the awards for Creativity by Rosalía.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Dec 3, 2020","It's confirmed: the new, much-anticipated brand from Alber Elbaz will make its debut in Paris next January. Born of a partnership between the famous designer, who led Lanvin for close to 15 years, and Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont, AZ Factory will unveil its first-ever collection during the French capital's prestigious Haute Couture Week, scheduled to take place from Monday, 25 to Thursday, 28 January. The committee of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture met on 19 November and selected the brand as an invited member. AZ Factory will therefore appear on the Haute Couture calendar alongside two more newcomers: French designer Charles Vilmorin, and American artist Sterling Ruby, both of whom have also been chosen as invited members. 

Furthermore, France's highest couture authority has again called on the following 12 fashion houses as invited members: Aelis, Aganovich, Azzaro, Christophe Josse, Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Julie De Libran, Rahul Mishra, Rvdk Ronald Van Der Kemp, Yuima Nakazato, Ulyana Sergeenko and Zuhair Murad.Although no introductions are necessary for Elbaz, who will be making his big comeback to the Parisian catwalk with this invitation, the two other new brands are worth a closer look. 23-year-old Charles de Vilmorin, for example, crossed paths with Alber Elbaz during a work experience placement at Lanvin when he was still a high school student.

Having then gone on to study at the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, de Vilmorin made his debut in the middle of quarantine by launching his women's and menswear brand via Instagram at the end of April. And it looks like there's no stopping the young designer, who was among the emerging talents selected by Gucci to be present their work during the recent GucciFest. 

Born into a family of artists, de Vilmorin quickly gained attention for his exuberant and colourful designs drawing on a fantastical universe with a childlike, fairy-tale aesthetic channelling, but also for his genderless approach and the experimental techniques used in his embroideries and textures.
 
As for multidisciplinary artist Sterling Ruby, he has also been making noise in the fashion world. Known for his ceramics, sculptures and vibrant paintings, as well as for his subversive collages and videos, he made his first incursion into fashion ten years ago, when he collaborated regularly with Raf Simons, during the designer's time at Dior and then at Calvin Klein.

In June 2019, the American artist launched his own S.R. Studio LA. CA. brand with a debut runway that caused a stir at Florence's Pitti Uomo, before moving on to Paris' womenswear fashion week in September. In July, Ruby revealed a collection of unique, fully handmade pieces. 

The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) has confirmed the dates of January 2021's fashion weeks and those of Haute Couture Week and menswear week, which is set to take place from Tuesday, 19 to Sunday, 24 January. The association has not, however, specified the format of these events, which risk being affected by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. It's possible that, similarly to this September's fashion weeks, January's events will feature mixed programmes with both physical runways and digital presentations.

"Dec 1, 2020","The British Fashion Council has unveiled its ‘New Wave Creatives 2020’ list of its 50 “most innovative and young creative talents from around the world”.Highlighting the most creative new talent across disciplines in fashion other than design, this year’s list has been cut from 100 in previous years “to allow for deeper dialogue with, and support of, these talents.”

Established in 2018, New Wave: Creatives is part of the BFC’s annual Fashion Awards that take place digitally for the first time in 2020. It highlights the emerging talents across multiple disciplines, including artists, activists, casting agents, commentators, florists, hair and make-up artists, image makers, nail artists, set designers, stylists and writers.Among this chosen this year include creative directors Betsy Johnson, Louis Burguet and Yasser Abubeker, stylists Flora Huddart, Marie Higuchi and Ola Ebiti, and image makers Carlijn Jacobs, Quil Lemons and Huang Jiaqi.

This year, the ceremony will take place virtually on 3 December and winners will be announced in The #FashionAwards 2020 film premiering on Fashionawards.com. 

“Continuing the initiative, in a year when creatives were facing cancelled contracts and a lack of government support, was crucial”, said BFC chief executive Caroline Rush.

“This year has been extremely challenging for our community of creatives and freelancers. Many of them in the UK are still struggling with issues such as decreased incomes due to lack of work, termination of contracts and exclusion from government support”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Nov 29, 2020","Like apparel, shoes and accessories, spectacles have been in ""green revolution"" mode for several years, looking to eco-friendly and natural materials, each as original as the next. Now, Wood Light has a particularly special innovation to present, with a pair of spectacle frames featuring shards of Volvic volcanic rock. The frames are the fruit of a collaboration involving an optician and a Michelin-starred chef.Three entrepreneurs from very different worlds -- but united in their love for the Auvergne region in central France -- joined forces to work on this new kind of spectacle frame. The Michelin-starred chef, Adrien Descouls, the optician and founder of Optic Dome, Thibault Randoin, and Wood Light brand founder, Julien Douzal, pooled their ideas, their creativity and their expertise to develop a capsule collection of spectacle frames combining wood with shards of Volvic stone. This volcanic rock is sourced specifically from quarries not far from the town of Volvic, known for its mineral water as well as its famous stone.

The story goes that it was Adrien Descouls -- who famously took part in France's edition of the ""Top Chef"" TV show -- who spoke to Thibault Randoin about wanting to get some unique glasses made that would celebrate the volcanoes of Auvergne. The optician then turned to Julien Douzal and his brand of artisanal glasses, made in the Puy de Dôme, to help bring this original project to life.Artisan-crafted in FranceBut these special spectacles weren't made in a day. The final result took several tests and prototypes -- plus around 30 stages and several hours of production. The famous stones were first broken to get a fine powder, which was sifted then encrusted in clear acetate to make the front face of the frames. This sits in contrast with the arms, which are made with a multi-layer plywood of walnut and ash.

""The transparency lets you see the shards of rock as if suspended -- it's a striking effect,"" say the trio behind the glasses. ""This dusting of black rock is also reminiscent of pepper, an extra nod to the work of Chef Adrien!""

This capsule collection is available online at Woodlight-boutique.com, priced from €259 to €299 (approx. US$309 to $356).Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Nov 22, 2020","Afro-Brazilian models Shirley Pitta and Gloria Maria Fonseca Siqueira had dreamed of the catwalk since they were girls, but in a Brazilian fashion world much whiter than the country itself, it remained a far-away fantasy until recently.In a sign of changing times in Brazil and elsewhere, the pair saw their dreams come true at this year's Sao Paulo Fashion Week.

SPFW, one of the industry's premier events, this year implemented a requirement for at least half of every label's models to be people of color, in a move hailed by black and indigenous rights activists.""It took me a long time to see myself as a beautiful person, a person who exists. Because on television, I always saw things I wasn't,"" says Pitta, 21, whose portfolio already includes work for leading fashion magazines Vogue, Elle and Marie Claire.

She calls herself a ""black favela girl from the Northeast,"" referring to the slums of Brazil's most impoverished region.

Her modern-day Cinderella story has captured as much attention as her striking appearance.

Before she was discovered in 2018, she spent her days selling grilled kebabs outside the zoo in her hometown, Salvador.

""We were there every day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. We got there in the morning and we worked into the night,"" she told AFP in between gigs at SPFW, as Brazil prepared to celebrate Black Consciousness Day on Friday.

With her short hair, high cheekbones and piercing gaze, Pitta exudes a confidence she says does not come as easily at it might appear.

""When I was little I used to wrap towels around my head,"" ashamed of the way her hair looked, she says.

""It's important to talk about these things, because our children won't have long, straight hair when they grow up, and they need to know that's not a problem. It's something beautiful.""

In Brazil, the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery -- in 1888 -- around 55 percent of the population identifies as black or mixed-race.

But although whites earn 74 percent more than people of color on average, a national debate on racial inequality has only begun relatively recently.

The conversation was perhaps delayed by a long-held idea among the Brazilian elite that the country was a ""racial democracy"" protected from racism by the fact that most people have some black or indigenous ancestry.

So it was a sign of radical change when SPFW, which was held remotely this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, required more inclusive casting.

That opened the doors to Pitta and 17-year-old Siqueira.'I'll never make it'Tall and thin, with an exuberant afro, Siqueira says it took her a long time to realize she could have a future in the fashion world, despite people telling her she had potential as a model.

""I'll never make it,"" she remembers thinking when she saw the model catalogue at Ford Models, one of the industry's top agencies, as a 15-year-old.

Now, she gives interviews from the agency's headquarters in Sao Paulo.

""I wasn't confident. I thought I wasn't beautiful enough,"" she says.

""But now I know I can travel the world through this.""

The youngest of seven children from a lower-middle-class family, Siqueira grew up admiring models like Naomi Campbell and Adut Akech.

She sees Brazil, home to supermodel Gisele Bundchen, as a country of diversity, something she would like to see it embrace for its positive aspects.

""Sometimes people feel like they're less because they're different, and they try to fit a standard that isn't them. They don't realize that being different is unique,"" she says.

Pitta sees the industry at a turning point.

""We're breaking through. I'm not going to sit there thinking about the past. We're moving forward,"" she says.Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Nov 19, 2020","The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body, has announced the dates for its next menswear and haute couture runway seasons in January 2021, confirming that these two major fashion events will actually take place early next year.The Federation made the announcement  one day after Pitti, the giant trade fair in Florence, revealed that it was pushing back its next event from January to February due to continued concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

However, here in Paris the Federation announced that it will host two full seasons next January. The dates of the next two catwalk seasons in Paris will be as follows: menswear from Tuesday 19 to Sunday 24 January 2021, and for haute couture, from Monday 25 to Thursday 28 January 2021.In a related move, the Federation also released estimates of the global media impact of its most recent catwalk season. The last Paris Fashion Week, dedicated almost exclusively to womenswear, took place from September 28 to October 6. All told, 82 houses were listed in the official calendar, with 17 staging live fashion shows; 19 physical presentations and 46 exclusively digital events.  The two upcoming seasons are expected to be similar mixes of live shows; physical rendezvous and online unveilings.

The entire content from the 2020 September/October season was presented on the platform developed by the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) in partnership with Launchmetrics. Extra content by the fashion houses, diverse media and cultural partners of the events furnished the offer, conceived as much for the professionals as for the general public.

Collectively, the video content of all houses registered on the official calendar reached a total of 153.5 million views; of which 135 million views on YouTube; along with 18.5 million cumulative views on Weibo, Tencent Video and Wechat. While the actual PFW platform cumulated 230,000 visitors and 606,000 page views.Using learning algorithms Launchmetrics, the brand performance cloud for fashion and luxury, estimated that the combined media impact value of this latest PFW stood at $123 million.

This audience was complimented by the visibility brought by The New York Times, The Asahi Shimbun and Canal+, adding a further 1.5 million pages viewed, and “helping to increase the visibility of the PFW and the houses in their communities and in the territories they cover respectively,” the Federation said in a release.

“Google, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Canal+, The New York Times, The Asahi Shimbun and Hylink (for the Chinese networks), have formed a network of partners essential to the amplification of this new… form of PFW, contributing to bring the diversity and creativity of the houses on the official calendar to the international scene. To date, the FHCM is pleased to share the success of the system set up, offering PFW an extended impact as a sign of its digital acceleration,” the Paris-based organization added.

"Nov 18, 2020","Alber Elbaz has unveiled the visual identity and logo of his new fashion house AZ Factory, one of the most keenly anticipated launches in fashion today. 
In a quirky release, Elbaz also confirmed that he will launch the project – which is backed by the giant luxury group Richemont - in January 2021.
 
“I am so happy and very much looking forward to an exciting launch in late January,” said Elbaz in a release.“We design beautiful, solutions-driven fashion that works for everyone. It is a reset, it is the birth of a Factory. A digital luxury brand based on innovation, technology, and, above all, a place to experiment and try new ideas,” Elbaz added.
 
His new visuals capture the wry wit for which he was known at his previous position as creative director of Lanvin, where from 2001 to 2015 he established himself as one of the half dozen most influential designers in the world. A round logo face with no mouth but smiling eyes that mimic the designer’s signature intellectual glasses is also featured among the phrase Albert & Amigos. The same name turns out to be the “consumer experience program” of his www.azfactory.com website.
 
“We are built around the core ideas of love, trust, and respect. We speak to our clients as we do with friends. Because we care,” added Elbaz. 

Since he was fired in a legendarily unwise management decision by Lanvin five years ago, the Israeli-raised Elbaz has kept a relatively low profile – with just a few collaborations, most notably with two collections of bags and shoes for Tod’s called Happy Moments. This year, however, the 59-year-old designer has been busy working from new offices in Montparnasse, inside the Cartier Foundation, the luxury jeweler that is Richemont’s single largest brand.
 
Elbaz also set up AZ Factory accounts on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and LinkedIn. Each featured the same message: “This is a reset from @alberelbaz8. This is the birth of a Factory. Our Story, Our Stories.” 
On his own Instagram account, Elbaz has been sharing images of his personal yoga trainer; Parisians packing shopping carts with large quantities of wine and a visit to the opening of the Cindy Sherman retrospective in the Louis Vuitton Foundation where he mugs for selfies with the artist – his one trip to a museum in the past six months.
 
Though financed by the very deep pockets of Richemont, Elbaz has promised that his new house will be a “dynamic and innovative start-up, built to transform dreams into reality.” 
 
As reported by FashionNetwork.com, Elbaz has also hired the former CEO of The Webster, Laurent Malecaze, to be his new CEO for AZ Factory.

"Nov 12, 2020","Accra might have had to cancel its fashion season this fall, but a quintet of the Ghanaian capital’s most happening new designers have been able to present their latest creations via a novel photo shoot backed by Mercedes-Benz.The city had been due to relaunch its catwalk season in October, but like runway weeks worldwide, was forced to call off the event due to the global pandemic. Instead of live shows, the luxury automobile marque selected five promising new talents to showcase their ideas in a series of photographs by photographer Carlos Idun-Tawiah.

Mercedes-Benz has been a highly active supporter of international fashion seasons for a quarter of a century; providing financial support and fleets of their limousines and high performance models for editors, buyers and VIPS to attend literally thousands of shows. This year, the German carmaker turned its focus on African talent – specifically five houses: Larry Jay, Steve French, Hazza, Atto Tetteh and Chloe Asaam.The shoot captures the energy of Accra, a city of 4.2 million people, using a documentary style to highlight the creators' diverse and eclectic styles. And this being 2020, the year of in-the-box collections, Mercedes Benz sent editors a box containing a toy viewfinder of images of the capital; mini cassettes of local tunes; bottles of Ghanaian cacao and even some dried plants – from Nigella and Phalaris to Setaria and Eucalyptus. The box a classic Ghanaian criss-cross print.

Enamored of the matriarchal figures in Ashanti mythology, designer Chloe Asaam showed delighted local ladies with fantastical Rasta-style-meets-courtesan wigs; colorful flutter-sleeve jabots and a great askew white cotton blouse worn on a beautiful model who sported Mercedes-Benz logo earrings.   While menswear designer Atto Tetteh unveiled bold cricket stripe pants paired with leather vests, and a marvelous white cotton tunic with traditional red motifs worn by a veteran gent posed before a classic model Mercedes.Hassan Alfaziz Iddrisu of Hazza focused on graphic African prints used in party shirts, and tops starring embroidered roosters seen in a family group portrait as seven locals stand around a late model Merc. The Ghanaian love affair with hand-painted graphics was evident in the work of Steve French, a series of white cotton tops hand painted excellently with ancestral motifs. Though the single most striking photo was of a father and son wearing clothes by Larry Jay, with the older gent proudly sporting a '70s glam tie-dye jacket and shirt in mixes of Imperial purple.“Aspirational design is at the heart of the Mercedes-Benz brand, and our commitment to supporting global talent who push creative conversation forward is more important than ever. The level of talent in Ghana is truly inspiring and we are excited to kick-start planning to re-launch Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Accra, when it is safe to do so,” said Bettina Fetzer, vice president marketing Mercedes-Benz AG.

Over the last 25 years, Mercedes-Benz has worked consistently internationally to aid creative talent in the fashion community. The brand currently supports Mercedes-Benz Fashion Weeks in Australia, Mexico, Madrid, Tbilisi and Berlin as well the International Festival of Fashion, Photography and Fashion Accessories in Hyères.

"Nov 11, 2020","Milan's Fashion Week will go ahead early next year with shows likely to continue employing virtual catwalks because of the coronavirus, organisers announced on Wednesday.While the men's shows will run from January 15 to 19, women's Fashion Week will be held from February 23 to March 1, the Italian Chamber of Fashion announced.

The fashion shows ""will become more digital or more physical, depending on the evolution of the pandemic"", chamber president Carlo Capasa told the Pambianco Summit, a conference for the fashion industry held online this year.Fashion is Italy's second-largest manufacturing industry and has been hard hit by the fallout from the global pandemic.

Fashion houses have had to rethink their marketing strategies and boost their digital offerings, and event organisers have been forced to innovate.

Last month, the British Fashion Council cancelled its men's Fashion Week in London, which had been scheduled for January, because of the pandemic, Brexit and what organisers said was a desire to rethink the event.

Instead, they are encouraging men's designers to take part in the women's week from February 19 to 23.

Milan's last fashion week in September, in which 156 collections were presented between online presentations and physical fashion shows, resulted in some 45 million views, Capasa said.

""This has been an Italian resilience operation,"" he said, adding that organisers ""hope to be able to return soon to the moments of physical encounters"".

According to a survey by Confindustria Moda, the sector's main employers' group, the industry in Italy lost 29 billion euros ($34 billion) in global revenue in the first nine months of the year.

In the third quarter, those companies surveyed recorded a 27 percent drop in sales, following decreases of 39 percent and 36 percent in the second and first quarters, respectively, said Confindustria Moda President Cirillo Coffen Marcolin.

"Nov 11, 2020","Stüssy and Comme des Garçons have come together for an end-of-year collaboration. On the occasion of Stüssy’s 40th anniversary, the Californian streetwear brand has chosen to continue its partnership with the Japanese label. After partnering to reimagine Stüssy’s signature Varsity Jacket at the beginning of the year, the brands are back at it with a collection of exclusive pieces that will be released in mid-November.
 The range includes a green satin-nylon military bomber jacket, a pinstripe jacket with matching trousers, graphic t-shirts which play with the logos of the two brands, a cotton tote bag, and a bucket hat.
 
The collection will be available from Friday November 13 on both brands’ e-commerce stores as well as in Dover Street Market  stores in New York and Los Angeles and a selection of Stüssy stores. The campaign which accompanies the launch was shot by London-based photographer Theo Sion.However, Stüssy does not intend to stop there. To celebrate, Stüssy is also announcing a series of collaborations with some of the most acclaimed designers of the moment, which the brand will unveil next week. 
 
Considered a pioneer in the streetwear sector, ex-surfer Shawn Stussy launched the label in 1980 in California’s Laguna Beach. The brand’s clothing and accessories collections quickly became popular around the world, notably thanks to its highly recognisable logo, which features Shawn Stussy’s signature that he used as a marker on his surfboards. 
 
The brand, which has become very urban, has a heritage founded in the worlds of board sports and music, after notably being popularised by the hip-hop movement. The brand has stores in the US, Asia, and Europe.

The fund is open to all gender collections and/or accessories.

"Nov 6, 2020","Only a matter of months ago, few could have imagined that a hybrid format would be able to multiply the media impact of fashion week runway shows by six. And yet, according to data presented in the latest study from Launchmetrics, positive results are still possible in the context of the ""new normal"" ushered in by the Covid-19 pandemic. It's a question of quickly adapting and reacting in order to make the most of the situation. 

Four people who know all about this are the leaders behind the ""big four"" fashion weeks: Pascal Morand, executive president of France's Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM); Steven Kolb, CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA); Carlo Capasa, president of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), and Caroline Rush, CEO of the British Fashion Council (BFC). Launchmetrics invited all four to take part in a special session at its first ever digital Performance Summit. ""Fashion week is a fantastic field for innovation. In the last year, we've experienced an incredible acceleration in aspects that would normally have taken ten years,"" said Morand in reference to the recent boost in Paris Fashion Week's digitalization efforts in response to the situation caused by the pandemic.

His Italian counterpart, Capasa, shares this sentiment. ""It's been a marvelous experiment on which we have to continue working in the future. It's given ordinary people the opportunity to have access to fashion shows. We're opening up and democratizing,"" explained the president of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, while also noting, with a somewhat bitter-sweet tone, that ""fashion is made to be touched and felt. It's still difficult to mix the physical with the digital.""Similar opinions about new formats were voiced by Rush, who is optimistic about the future. ""This period is allowing for greater freedom and creativity,"" said the CEO of the British Fashion Council in response to fashion journalist Jessica Michault, who moderated the conversation. Comparing these innovations to physical formats, she added, ""digital fashion weeks have given brands greater creative freedom. Smaller businesses are concentrating on how to position themselves in order to construct a direct-to-consumer (D2C) business, as well as on the idea of greater inclusivity and sustainability in the fashion industry. I hope that these influences stay.""

As for Kolb, he also expressed satisfaction with the first steps taken by New York Fashion Week in the era of hybrid shows. ""We knew that the whole season would be a challenge and that we'd need to make decisions in real time,"" commented the CFDA CEO, citing the positive reactions from both the public and industry professionals. Ultimately though, he thinks that brands ""have to do what's best for them,"" and still argues in favor of the important role of fashion weeks. Flexibility, creativity and innovation are key for the future""They are narratives in themselves, with their own cultural message. They are the place where professionals meet and they boost business in the sector, as well as the economy of the cities where they happen,"" affirmed Kolb, defending that fashion weeks will still happen in New York, even if, in parallel, the door could be opened for brands to present their collections at other times. ""Obviously, the cost is a challenge. It's not the same for a brand owned by LVMH as for an independent American designer,"" acknowledged the CEO, concluding that ""the question is how to maintain the framework of the fashion week, while also offering flexibility to different industry players.""

For the event organizers, this process of adaptation could involve coed shows, like those hosted by Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors in New York. In Kolb's opinion, this format can allow designers to ""tell the overarching story of the brand.""

Capasa, on the other hand, argued that ""Italy has a strong menswear industry which requires its runway shows to happen at a different time,"" while also pointing out that for some brands which present both men's and womenswear collections, ""it is not possible to produce both at the same time."" In light of this complex landscape of varied and specific needs, the president of the CNMI wants ""to be flexible, maintaining separate seasons, but giving brands the possibility to organize themselves,"" presenting womenswear collections during men's fashion week, for example, or exploring ""genderless"" offerings. 

All being well, Milan Fashion Week will therefore uphold its separate events in January and February. Morand also made the same commitment for Paris' dedicated menswear, womenswear and Haute Couture weeks, which will return with a hybrid format. ""Digital presentations will never replace physical shows, but we're at the start of a process through which digitalization has enhanced creativity and the visual arts,"" commented the French executive president, emphasizing the importance of establishing collaborations and implementing a video platform with its own magazine, which functions as something which is ""fun, useful for professionals and connected to the brands."" As for the transition necessary for these initiatives, in Morand's opinion, the change is already happening. ""We will continue to innovate and we won't return to the past,"" he concluded.

"Nov 6, 2020","Once fashion month draws to a close and the fashion weeks hosted by the ""Big Four"" fashion capitals –  New York, London, Milan and Paris –  are wrapped up, a number of other runways light up around the world. And this year the challenge for events both great and small was the same: trying to square the circle that is successfully organizing a fashion week in the middle of a pandemic. Having already witnessed the solutions proposed by the Western fashion powerhouses, it's worth taking a look at Asia. More specifically, South Korea, where from October 20 through 25, the Spring/Summer 2021 edition of Seoul Fashion Week took place in an exclusively digital format, featuring videos from the likes of veteran designer Gee Chun-Hee and the UK's Edward Crutchley. In a leading market for technology, the Korean fashion industry's big event went all in on innovation to adapt to the challenges of Covid-19. Someone who knows this better than most is Jeon Mi-Kyung. With a career in media and communications spanning more than two decades, including a stint as editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar Korea, she is now the director of Seoul Fashion Week, having taken over from local designer Jung Kuho last year. As noted by the editor, her role was made significantly more complicated over the last few months, due to the pandemic. 

""We are trying to make the most of this unique opportunity to turn somewhat analogous aspects of our existing fashion week into innovative changes better suited to the current digital environment,"" explained the director when discussing the event, which saw Spring/Summer 2021 collections by 46 designers presented over the course of six days, all through the medium of creative videos.WeChat Mini Program: a showcase for 400 million Chinese users a dayJeon highlighted how the event used ""various digital platforms"" to open up ""access to not only the fashion industry but also ordinary people,"" recognizing that although they lost something of the ""dramatic touch"" of physical runway shows, they managed to achieve a ""far wider reach"" for the event. Made available through the event's own site and YouTube channel; Naver, the largest web portal in South Korea; Chinese messaging app WeChat, where pieces from some collections went on sale directly during shows; and the fashion video platform founded by British photographer Nick Knight, the videos have racked up more than 670,000 views to date, according to the latest data from the event. 



Faced with the restrictions currently challenging the industry, Jeon maintains her optimism. ""More press and buyers gained access to the collection compared to previous invite lists. This was only possible because it was digital,"" she said, acknowledging that ""some of the front-row emotional impact, or direct orders on showroom visits is lost. Nevertheless, the interest from press and buyers who access shows and designers via digital platforms and videoconferences is still very much alive."" The event is therefore not dismissing the idea of taking some of the newly implemented formats forward to future editions, even if, ultimately, it intends to fuse offline and online experiences as soon as this is possible again.

In order for its digital strategy to work, it was fundamental for Seoul Fashion Week to provide support for brands. ""Helping designers get used to producing their own digital content to introduce their collection in this fashion week was a key priority,"" stated Jeon, while also pointing out the need to explore ""different ways to promote the collections and sales,"" including specific strategies for the Chinese market. The event's approach to social media was therefore notably different to that adopted by European fashion weeks, where Instagram reigns supreme. Instead, Seoul Fashion Week placed its bets on shopping options offered by the WeChat Mini Program, a platform launched in collaboration with e-commerce giant Tencent, which owns messaging services QQ and WeChat, and boasts some 400 million daily users in China. The event also set up direct shopping sessions through Naver's fashion and beauty channel and organized a ""Designer Window Exhibition.""A post-Covid-19 strategy focused on direct sales""Besides the basic support to promote the designers’ collections for B2B sales as in the past, we are expanding our support for B2C sales,"" said the event's director, explaining the choice to use the ""see now, buy now"" format and live commerce as mechanisms to support designers in ""recovering the drop in sales due to Covid-19."" Interestingly, Jeon sees more potential for this recovery in emerging design. ""The traditional corporate brands are currently struggling, but young and creative designers with unique and practical items, targeting millennials are on the rise. I have no doubt these brands, already growing in Asian markets, will advance Korean fashion in the global scene,"" she posited. The stars of the latest edition of Seoul Fashion Week were the collections offered up by 33 South Korean designers. These included former K-Pop star Park Seung-Gun and his streetwear label PushButton, the sober aesthetic of Kim Jae-Hyun's Aimons and Lee Jae-Hyung's conceptual brand MAXXIJ. Han Hyun-Min's Münn, which is inspired by 60s tailored pieces, also took part, as did Park Yun-Soo with the urban stylings of Big Park, and veteran designer Gee Chun-Hee, who celebrated 20 years in the fashion industry with a video from her Miss Gee Collection, which opened the fashion week.

The event also featured ""Generation Next,"" a selection of nine new local talents, as well as a presentation from British designer Edward Crutchley, the result of an exchange program developed with London Fashion Week. In parallel, the event organized ""Generation Next Seoul,"" a professional trade show aiming to promote South Korean fashion beyond the country's borders, connecting 91 domestic brands with up to 115 foreign buyers. 

As a market which is sensitive to trends, South Korea is seen by its neighbors as a country with ""good taste."" According to Jeon, the nation's fashion imports come from a wide range of countries, but the majority of its exports go to China, the largest foreign market for the South Korean fashion industry. Furthermore, the country's status as an important consumer of global luxury goods has also had an effect on the impact of the pandemic on the sector.  

""Despite the economic downturn, the interest and spending in fashion have not dropped. If anything, Covid-19 has slowed the growth and impact of local fashion influencers but the fashion industry is still growing, and its spectrum expanding,"" concluded Jeon.

Formerly a division of the French automotive giant Citroen, DS became a stand-alone brand in 2015, and plans to become a full electric label by 2025. Its name DS is a play on the French word for goddess, or déesse. Its DS 3 has become the best selling premium subcompact car in Europe, with a 40% market share.
 
The DS 3 Crossback Ines de la Fressange is an attempt to combine innovative technology with French craftsmanship, including a wide range of power units like the 100% electric E-TENSE model, a concept created in the Paris region.  While its upholstery comes from weavers in the southwestern Ariège region based on woven leather techniques.
 
The partnership plans to produce just 1,500 models, each coming with a Marcia range wallet from de la Fressange, with the deliveries in France in January 2021.

"Nov 2, 2020","Nobody could accuse Sir Paul Smith of slowing down, even in the year he celebrates his 50th anniversary. 
Despite spending almost all of spring practically alone in his Covent Garden headquarters – which normally houses over 200 staffers - fashion’s only knight has still managed to produce a series of men’s and women’s collections. Plus, he has just opened his own foundation, a novel organization designed to guide creative spirits on the right path, and help them avoid career roadblocks. Something Smith has considerable experience doing, as he was a part-time private tutor to Alexander McQueen back in the '90s. 
 
Smith was pretty avuncular already by that date. He opened his first signature store in his native Nottingham in October 1970, where in typically eccentric Brit fashion he made his pet Afghan hound the boutique manager.Smith, 74 in July, has also found time to produce a new book, marking his half century in fashion, edited by Tony Chambers, with a forward by Jony Ive, which makes double sense when you consider that it recounts Smith’s life in fashion via 50 of his favorite objects. Most of which sit in his famously packed office, with a humongous table and scores of shelves for his treasure trove of memorabilia.
 
In the end, the book includes everything from the Kodak Retinette camera his dad gave him and his insane matchbox collection to the beloved linen prover magnifying glass and this cycling nut’s Paramount bicycle. All kept in central London, which is where Sir Paul found himself this weekend. 
FashionNetwork.com (FNW): Hello, Paul, how are you?
Sir Paul Smith (PS): Very well, and calling from Covent Garden. I spent 16 weeks here on my own during in the last lookdown. I’d say today there are about 20 people, as we rotate staff, while before there were normally 200 people in this building.
 
FNW: How is business?
PS: Terrible! But we are all in the same boat these days, whether we are Louis Vuitton or Marks & Spencer.
 
FNW: Tell us about your new foundation?
PS: Well, we have been working on the idea for a few years and putting a little money aside every year for the Paul Smith’s Foundation. It’s not a huge sum, and we’ve been working with agency that handles our app and website and a lady to answer questions. I just thought that in our 50th anniversary year it would be nice to put some of the experience back into youth. I’d say, pre-Covid, at least once a week a school comes around to this building. Like the Art Center from Pasadena. They often come in April; a great graphic design school with amazing kids, who do a project for us and I critique it for them.
 
FNW: What’s your goal with this foundation?
PS: It’s so fascinating to demystify how you start something and how you get into a particular world. How you demystify an approach to a career – by simply asking, have you tried this college? Or tried out this idea one weekend? This is not a prize nor a travel scholarship. There is not enough money for that. It’s about helping people have clarity about where to direct their energy.
  
FNW: When did you first personally lecture on fashion?
PS: Years ago in the back of the Odeon in Marble Arch, after Terence Conran and a lady called Jean Muir. I popped my head into the room and there were 800 people and I was shitting myself! Plus, I realized everyone was reading their speech and I can’t work from an autocue as I have dyslexia.
 
When Terence Conran said, “Any questions?” nobody responded. So, I asked if I could put up photos and then the talk became very visual and then at the end I said ‘Any questions, and I will give you a prize!’ and about 80 hands went up.  So I always take a few gifts when I speak - scarves and socks and stuff.
 
FNW: Will there be mentoring?
PS: We don’t really do that, though we will respond to all questions left on the foundation website. 
FNW: But have you mentored personally? 
PS: Yes, informally, with young designers like Grace Wales Bonner or Priya Ahluwalia who does great recycling. I even helped Alexander McQueen out – when Lee was at St Martins and he was a bit lost and Suzy Menkes told him to see me. I got to know Lee quite well, and I remember he once said, ‘People want to do something under my name,' and he asked me, 'what’s a contract?’ No reason why they should know. They are designers! Smith laughs out loud.

So, it’s not intellectual advice nor supersonic high finance, but a little pushing in the right direction. Wales Bonner I’ve met three times and we just chat and she comes with a little notebook with questions and I answer the questions. When we meet for coffee she is always very organized.
 
FNW: Why did you pick an unusual form for your new book?
PS: It was Tony Chambers, who used to edit Wallpaper, who suggested not to do another load of pictures, like look 15 from 1982 or look 33 from 1983. He said why don’t you choose from your crazy office - 50 objects and write a page-long essay on each – camera, chair, drinking glass, whatever.
 
Mine is not your typical formal business story. How a young designer starts out and is taken over by a hedge fund and then they open lots of shops. I still own about 80% of everything except in Japan, because my wife wanted to sell her shares. It’s for her grandkids. I don’t think they even know yet! Smith cackles.
 
FNW: How is 2020 going?
PS: We start showing pre-coll for winter next week. Dare I say, I give us a pat on the back since we managed to pull a proper collection together from here by working with my team long distance. Quite a few buyers were complimentary as many designer have just sketches and swatches. Now, we are already working on spring 2022.
 
FNW: When do you expect to stage another live runway show?
PS: We are not sure if it feels right anymore and we are reassessing the delivery cycle. Maybe it will be more like seasonless collections to ensure fewer mark-downs. Look, the whole industry is in turmoil, and no one is brave enough to do brave things. Even the big guys. But we do have a beautiful showroom in Paris so if we are allowed to move next year despite Covid we will show there end of January. And then consider the future again.
 
FNW: I know you love Italy. Did you manage to go there this year?
PS: I managed to get Italy for three weeks starting on July 8. And I would love go back for my factory visits in Veneto and for shoes in Tuscany and the Marches, but sadly this year I cannot really, as you have to isolate both ends.

"Oct 29, 2020","The British Fashion Council, UK fashion’s governing body, announced Thursday the dates of the next three editions of London Fashion Week (LFW), even as it revealed that there would be no January menswear season in 2021.As a result, the next three LFW editions will take place on the following dates in 2021: February 19 to 23; June 11 to 14 and September 17 to 21. All three seasons will feature both menswear and womenswear.

Due to the continuing Covid crisis, the next London season will be primarily a digitally driven event, freely available on the London Fashion Week website, with some scaled back physical activations, such as intimate runway shows and showroom viewings for editors and buyers by appointment.The announcement brings to an end, at least for 2021, London Fashion Week Men’s, the standalone menswear season that was first launched back in June 2012. However, the BFC did underline in a release that “London Fashion Week January 2022 will be reviewed next year.”

Commenting on the changes, BFC Menswear Chair and UK GQ Editor-in-Chief Dylan Jones noted: “When we launched London Collections: Men in June 2012, which then became London Fashion Week Men’s, we were responding to an industry need and to the necessity to have a platform for our brilliant British menswear designers from emerging talent to Savile Row tailoring. A lot has changed since then, and this year’s pandemic made us all rethink the current system in place. We are confident that this move will help designers  reach more people via the digital LFW platform, while still allowing them to do business as early as January without the deadline of a show.”

The BFC stressed in a release that it “is in constant communication with the Government to understand guidelines and restrictions,” even as the current government constantly zigzags in its polices during the pandemic. The BFC added that it developed its strategy in light of the “challenges around the movement of goods, samples and people in the single market and customs union post Brexit.”The organization has also held surveys and roundtables with designers, and conversations with sales showrooms before making these latest decisions. Given the likely continued absence of foreign buyers in London early next year, the BFC is working on a sales-focused campaign using the London Fashion Week platform to drive reach to designer online showrooms and physical sales contacts.

“As the fashion industry moves towards a more sustainable and responsible future in line with the newly formed Institute of Positive Fashion, our aim is to continue to redefine our fashion week model, embracing digital and technological innovation while offering ideas and solutions that will work for all designer businesses. Moving LFWM into LFW in February will continue to de-gender LFW, allow designers greater flexibility to consider what collection they show when and minimize travel requirements, taking us one step closer to a more sustainable future,” argued Caroline Rush, BFC Chief Executive.

The BFC’s move to genderless seasons began this summer, which also coincided with the well-received revamp of its online platform, creating an Official Digital Hub which permits retailers, media and consumers to view and buy collections.

"Oct 21, 2020","German fashion label Boss and American sportswear company Russell Athletic are launching a collaborative capsule. Taking inspiration from the rich archives of both brands, the laid-back collection will combine Boss' tailoring expertise with Russell Athletic's sporty stylings. 
 ""Casualization is an important element in our Boss collections, so it’s the perfect time to partner with a pioneer in this field. Russell Athletic invented the sweatshirt almost 100 years ago, and it has been a great experience to work with a brand that has such a heritage and expertise in sportswear,"" commented Hugo Boss chief brand officer Ingo Wilts in a release. 

Set to launch for Pre-Fall 2021, the Boss x Russell Athletic capsule will feature a number of gender-neutral pieces, according to the brands.""When I first traveled to the U.S., a Russell Athletic sweatshirt was among my first purchases. I have always wanted to do something with the brand, so this collaboration is a very special project for me personally. Working with the team in Kentucky was absolutely enriching and inspiring,"" added Wilts. 

When it is released in March 2021, the collection will be accompanied by a dedicated campaign produced by creative agency Highsnobiety. 

""We are excited to partner with one of the biggest fashion brands in the world to create a collection that takes inspiration from fashion and sports to reinvent iconic pieces in a whole new way,"" explained Ricardo Aranda, vice president of Russell Athletic.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 20, 2020","The barriers between videogaming and fashion are blurring. Gamers are a popular demographic nowadays, with Nicolas Ghesquiere designing clothes for League of Legend heroines, Valentino’s fun foray into Animal Crossing and Longchamp’s with pokémon icon Pikachu. Gone is the scruffy geek look, contemporary gamers are a chic bunch.Four French dotcom and board sport businessmen have zeroed in on this new trend. They are the co-founders of digital infotainment broadcaster Melty, Alexandre Malsch and Bruno Maugery, together with the former president EMEA and CFO of Boardriders, Thomas Chambolle, and the former head of design and product development at DC Shoes and Element, Philippe Vial. Together, they decided to create a lifestyle label inspired by the videogame and e-sport culture.

A project founded on the finding that over 70% of French consumers say they play videogames at least occasionally, and that the market is worth $120 billion worldwide and $5 billion in France alone.The new label is called Fulllife, and its collections will include “comfy, directional apparel, with quality clothes that are sustainable and eco-responsible. [Fulllife] will also feature a range of tech products specifically designed for videogamers and professional e-sport players,” said Fulllife’s founders in a press release.

No product has been dropped yet, but Vial's design savvy ought to guarantee the new label will be stylish. Fulllife is touted as a digital native vertical brand, and the relationship with its consumer community will follow the conventions of the e-sport world, whose potential the label is keen to tap. While brands like Element thrive on the association with skateboarding, Fulllife intends to become a must for videogamers, appealing not just to pro practitioners but fans too.

The videogame market has been booming for some time, and the lockdowns imposed almost worldwide have given it a further boost. It is a sector that, like any sport, has both occasional practitioners and regular competitors. The number of e-sport enthusiasts, a well-established demographic in Asia and one that is increasingly expanding in Europe, is growing by leaps and bounds. In 2019, the e-sport industry is said to have generated a global revenue of $1.1 billion,
and it is still in its infancy.

While physical sporting events, both at amateur and professional level, have been severely affected by the pandemic, and their business model seems in jeopardy, e-sport is taking hold. Two years ago, entry-level e-sport sponsorship deals were still relatively affordable, but the figures are steadily escalating, especially now that sport equipment brands are serious about this business, and have been signing cheques worth several million euro in order to sponsor e-sport tournaments and teams, chiefly in South Korea and Asia, the discipline’s leading markets.

Lifestyle labels however have not really dared to engage with the e-sport and gaming community yet. Fulllife is playing to win, an opportunity that is coveted by others besides its founders, who have already raised €2.5 million to get the venture off the ground.

The first funding round has tapped a bank, Pyrénées Gascogne Développement, of the Crédit Agricole group, and a group of business angels, comprising influential French figures from the world of sport, the web and fashion. Among them, Jean-Michel Aulas, founder of software company Cegid and owner of French top-flight football team Olympique Lyonnais through his family holding company Holnest.

Also, Olivier Mathiot, president of The Camp, vice-president of France Digitale and co-founder of PriceMinister; Thierry Debarnot, co-founder and president of Gaming Campus, the first European training campus for the videogame industry; Marc Jalabert, a partner of Acequia Capital and former GM Marketing and Operations at Microsoft France; Jean-Philippe Hecquet, former CEO of Lanvin and Sandro; and Geoffrey La Rocca, president of the Digital Century Group and former general manager of Teads.

A group of businessmen with complementary know-how, whose resources and advice are likely to ensure a bright future to Fulllife.

"Oct 16, 2020","One brand keeping very busy despite the pandemic is Amiri, which opened its debut boutique last week on Rodeo Drive, and followed that up with a Friday morning show in Los Angeles. 
In the past few seasons, Mike Amiri has shown in Paris, but this season saw him in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence in the hills of Beverly Hills.
 
Opening the 9.49-minute show video with overalls, tank and reading glasses, the model posed at the pool of the famed location, before slinging on a Saigon soldier bomber jacket.Dudes strolling purposely across a basketball court; in preppy shorts and knit aertexes with cloche hats and loads of bags. Cutest of all, a new mini guitar man-bag with a Fender shape; and a mini basketball man purse.
 
A live DJ - legendary LA producer, The Alchemist - mixing some chill tracks as the hirsute boys march in leather shorts and overalls – all worn under polite rocker redingotes. 
 
Los Angeles glinting in the background, as the cast gradually strides up onto the villa by master architect John Lautner, a glass vessel of a dwelling that huddles in dense vegetation. A classic example of American organic architecture for a show that climaxed with some great floral prints. A James Bond set that’s been used in movies like Charlie’s Angels and The Big Lebowski that looked just right with Amiri.
 Mike Amiri began his garage punk label back in 2013. His is a blend of LA Urban Cowboy meets laid back rocker, composed of far classier fabrics than one normally associates with grungy rock 'n' roll.
 
Historically, Amiri is a novel encounter of careful tailoring and distressed materials; of classy blazers and silken soul singer shirts. Under sleek tuxedos, Amiri generally favors jeans so skinny they look glued on. His dudes even enjoy cardigans, though finished in intarsia skeletons.
 
Of Iranian origin, Mike was born in Los Angeles in 1976, and began his career by hand crafting stage outfits for the likes of Axl Rose and Steven Tyler. That led him to developing a capsule for Los Angeles most noted concept boutique Maxfield, before then creating his own eponymous collection.He has been nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s Emerging Designer Award and in 2019 nabbed the CFDA’s Menswear Designer of the Year title.
 
Underlining Amiri’s commercial appeal, OTB, the key investment wing of Italian billionaire jean entrepreneur Renzo Rosso, acquired a minority stake in Amiri last year.
 
He may not be the next Azzedine Alaia or Giorgio Armani but Mike Amiri does have a signature look; a compelling DNA and plenty of ambition. This is one brand we will be hearing plenty of this decade.

"Oct 16, 2020","The Quakers, early advocates of democracy, religious freedom and equality for women, where the key inspiration for the latest collection by Tory Burch. Even if the collection didn’t feel remotely political; more a statement about the need for restrained creativity at this very particular moment.“With so much heartbreak and chaos are around us, I looked for inspiration in memory. Going back to my childhood when I went to a Quaker school, a sect of Christianity that embraces all religions and people. And equal rights for women and men,” explained Burch, in a video conference with editors in Paris on Thursday.
 
Like so many designers, Burch skipped any actual live catwalk event this fall. Instead, she shot a video at Shaker Museum in Massachusetts,  using the early 19th century wooden structures as the ideal backdrop. Even including the Brethren’s East Shop, a mustard-colored timber building of the Shakers – an offshoot of Quakerism - that was used as a tailoring workshop to produce  the utilitarian clothes of this sect.The end result was a spring-summer 2021 collection that managed to be unfussy yet highly creative; in many ways one of Burch’s best ever fashion expressions. The season in general has also sounded a further death knell for see-now-buy-now fashion; since pretty well all of the collections shown by major designers will not be available for another three months. Burch’s collection, for instance, will start to retail on February 2021.
 
Tory’s polished puritans will appear next spring in embroidered poplin dresses or blouses, often with removable collars; striped tunics with cut-off tulip sleeves; quilted line coats in streaky  blues; and defined embroidered peacoats in raffia prints. 
For racier moments, macramé dresses paired with silk crepe pants, over lace-up sandals; and slouchy yet feminine bright white poplin gowns with macramé tassels.
 
Tory even showed a retro sweater with the image of a couple playing with their dog, which the designer said was very good “therapy,” something  her design team like to tease her and hubby Pierre-Yves Roussel about.
 
“I had to go back to an earlier time in my life. Visiting Pennsylvania craft shops with quilts; seeing baskets hanging up in the mud room of my parents farm. There is a Quaker maxim: Beauty rests on utility,” smiled Burch, referring to her family home in Valley Force, ironically for the pacific Quakers, the site of Washington’s Continental Army during the War of Independence.
 
Like the egalitarian Quakers who had women ministers well before other religions, Burch shared menswear materials with her ladies – such as a cream colored pinstripe suit that was extremely spruce, and recalled her dashing dad, as did several references to her father’s classic Moroccan caftans.Other sure-fire commercial hits included a new Capri sandal, and a new Eleanor bag made in soft leather that expands and contracts. Her accessories team even rolled out a folded loafer that is as soft as a ballet flat, which should spark a whole new trend; as might her light blue glasses for the computer.
 
The lockdown, she explained, had partly been a silver lining by granting her time to just focus; helping encourage the concept of the restraint; and the importance of integrity to fashion. She noted that during lockdown a lot of new customers were Gen Z.
 
“Which is very hopeful. Since younger people want brands that stand for things.  I try to stay away from politics, which is hard right now. I want to  stand for humanity and equal rights. What we want is to celebrate humanity and inclusion and diversity,” Burch concluded.

"Oct 16, 2020","Faced with the difficult task of defining the “new normal” and adjusting to the ongoing changes, the big four fashion weeks have now come and gone.

From New York Fashion Week -- which kicked-off on September 11, to Paris Fashion Week rounding out an unusual fashion month on October 8 -- fashion capitals have tried to provide answers, inventing new formats in line with current restrictions and needs.

Now the time has come to take stock, review the success of the new formats and prepare for next season. Who are the big winners in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic? Are major digital activations really more favourable than limited physical events? What are the marketing strategies that will help brands thrive in a post-pandemic world?

After monitoring online and social posts and articles, analytics specialist Launchmetrics brings a bit of clarity.'Hybrid' events should continue to shape the new normal when health regulations allow, Launchmetrics has claimed. According to its latest report, brands who took the “phygital” approach, like Jason Wu, Miu Miu, Fendi and Dior, fared much better than those who privileged a purely physical or digital event. In fact, the more successful brands garnered six times more Media Impact Value (MIV) per attendee. Launchmetrics also recommends brands to rethink their voice mix, using a combination of media, celebrities, influencers, collaborations and owned media and activating each with a hyper-focused strategy.

Interestingly, influencers can be just as effective without being present, the study found. Some of the top posts from the season came from influencers who did not attend in person, but yet contributed to the overall Media Impact Value while reminding followers to tune in. And while celebrity-studded front rows have become a thing of the past, the past season has shown that models can be a valuable source for generating media impact. This means that the choice of models needs to be carefully considered, taking into account their social media influence to ensure maximum impact.Media will always be an ally, owned media gains tractionThis season, owned media moved to the forefront for many brands. Launchmetrics said that using social media accounts to share campaign content whilst simultaneously increasing post rates translated into an uptick in Media Impact Value for several labels. But firms don’t operate in a vacuum, so now it’s the time to seek out mutually beneficial partnerships and create strong campaigns that speak to the target audience. Indeed, brands who were able to maintain their MIV did so in part by leaning on their official partners. Media will always be an ally, the study claims, so it’s important to create specific content that will amplify a brand’s messages across various channels. Despite the circumstances that prevented the staging of massive physical events at New York Fashion Week, Launchmetrics said that live events continued to play a key role during fashion month — even without real crowds in attendance. In a ranking measuring brands’ Media Impact Value, Jason Wu came out on top, having more than doubled the MIV of his February show to $3.6 million by staging a show inspired by his love for Tulum. Christian Siriano ranked second with an MIV of $3.1 million after generating strong interest from his backyard garden show in Connecticut. The show featured star model Coco Rocha, who walked the runway and shared 14 posts about the experience, garnering $280,000 in MIV for the brand. Finally, media outlets accounted for nearly 70% of placements and generated more than half of New York’s total MIV.  

Meanwhile, Instagram took the crown during London Fashion Week, which hosted a physical and digital schedule on September 15-25. The social media app was the strongest platform, with the number of posts shared by brands growing by 57%.

Additionally, Victoria Beckham generated the highest MIV at London Fashion Week, worth $9.6 million. The fashion designer hosted a “hybrid” show with both a physical event (attended by her famous family, who have helped drive media buzz in the past) and a digital screening. The event also benefited from a collaboration with Tiffany & Co which saw the designer wear items from jeweller’s new TiffanyT1 collection during her presentation and in a sponsored post.At Milan Fashion Week, influencers saw a decrease in numbers but big names like Chiara Ferragni had some of the highest ranked posts overall. Notably, the Italian influencer generated the most impact ($461,000 in MIV) despite skipping the shows this year by sharing one of her favourite looks from Fendi. Fendi came also first in the Milan ranking with a total MIV of $13 million, helped by a 59% increase in owned media posts. Buzz-worthy models also helped increase influencer voice, with Taylor Hill walking the runway for Etro and Irina Shayk representing Versace. Donatella Versace’s brand generated enormous buzz worth $11 million thanks to its Versacepolis campaign, with the hashtag alone generating $6.5 million in MIV. Additionally, the designer label was praised for featuring plus-size models, boosting its MIV further.

The last of the big four fashion weeks took place in Paris from 26 September to 8 October, with Dior once again emerging as the most influential brand followed by Louis Vuitton and Chanel. While the overall Media Impact Value of PFW decreased compared with the previous season, these three brands managed to see an increase, particularly Nicolas Ghesquière’s marque, which nearly doubled its performance.

Dior’s influencer strategy focused more on “quality” than “quantity”, resulting in a 25% decrease in placements but a 40% increase in MIV thanks to collaborations with influencers like Valentina Ferragni and Karen Wazen. Miu Miu enjoyed a dramatic increase, with its Media Impact Value up by 125% when compared with last season. Owned Media was a major contributor, fuelled by an increase in the number of placements from 40 posts to 124 and a renewed influencers and celebrities strategy that generated up to $2 million in MIV with 140 placements. The most valuable placement was from actress Gabrielle Union, who didn't even attend in person.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 15, 2020","Many people regard New York as the ultimate urban jungle; Michael Kors sees it more as a charming oasis. On Thursday, Kors became the latest designer to unspool his newest collection virtually, with spring-summer 2021 clothes designed to reflect nature through an urban lens. 
Underlining the theme, Kors released a video entitled 'Up on the Roof,' a portrait of the designer, his city and his inspiration by filmmaker Haley Elizabeth in which he spent more time in the community gardens of the New York Restoration Project (NYRP) than in his studio.
 
“Even in a very dark moment, I am an optimist. I am still convinced that people will do the right thing. That we can work to a better future. So, when we did take a walk in a neighborhood, I lived in all my life. I saw spring coming into bloom; whether it was a little tulip flower bed,” explained Kors, as he marched, mask on, in the West Village, by the well known liquor store sign at Grove Street.
 
Ranging about the city with shots of its iconic landmarks – from the Statue of Liberty to the Freedom Tower – Kors meets Bette Midler and introduces Samantha Diaz, or “Just Sam,” the American Idol winner. 
His goal, Kors said, was to make fashion that is “thrilling to wear now, but also good to be worn for 20 years….  Natural colors... Things that feel artisanal. So, even if machine made you know that human hands have touch it.”
 
The result was a far more touchy-feely collection that opened with knit dresses with extended tassel hems; loose prairie dresses worn under mannish double-breasted redingotes; elegant Grecian goddess dresses, with hand-rolled fabric belts, or enormous grandfather shorts, casually belted. For more va-va-voom moments, a series of great off the shoulder big bold cable knits, paired with asymmetrical skirts showing plenty of thigh.
                                                                                                                                                          
In a co-ed collection, guys got linen pajama pants and chunky woolen tanks; posh hippie woven leather satchels; or crisp light-gray chalk-stripe suits worn over to-the-knee white Nehru-collar shirts. With several gals wearing the exact same fabrics in similar outfits – from the country gent waistcoats to the granddaddy shirts to the feminist bra tops, a key look this season. 
The entire cast shot in a Bronx community garden, clutching bunches of flowers; or strolling underneath tomato trestles; just five blocks from where Kors' grandfather was born.
 
All about casual chic in the Covid-lockdown, as the soundtrack to his show video featured Just Sam singing a great version of New York singer Carole King’s classic tune, You Got a Friend.
 
Kors extolling the joys in this no-voyage moment of “travelling through live performances,” as Just Sam’s full-throated chords echo in a Central Park passage, before Kors catches up with Midler, who recalls buying 52 NYRP community gardens for people to grow their own food back in 1999.
 
“You are a great New Yorker and you step in,”  Bette says to Michael, a NYRP board member and long-time supporter.
 
“When I see a garden come to bloom, I immediately feel in love with idea of community gardens. It’s the perfect culmination of this collection which is about nature in the city. How do we find that balance… In fashion we crave texture and things which make you feel better,” explains Kors, scissors in hand at a basil plant, before exiting the scene in a 'Vote' T-shirt.

"Oct 15, 2020","The recent round of fashion weeks, heavily affected by the pandemic, marks a turning point. For the first time ever, fashion labels were able to present their collections to a global audience on the internet: only a third of labels managed to stage catwalk shows, the others opting for video presentations.

Worldwide lockdowns and the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have led the majority of labels to rethink their product range, introducing items that are much more comfortable and minimalistic, ideal for snug, everyday living in the comfort of one’s own home. Indeed, the women’s ready-to-wear collections shown in New York, London, Milan and Paris between September 13 and October 6 2020 reflected a more pragmatic approach by fashion designers, who are trimming down the number of looks and going back to essentials.

Many designers focused on their labels’ DNA and history, and heralded their collections’ inclusivity by choosing plus-size, transgender and pansexual models. This autumn like never before, in this pandemic-ridden world, fashion shows have introduced scores of new faces from every corner of the world.

1. MasksWith the Covid-19 pandemic rampant, face masks have become an indispensable accessory. In the past, a few labels did present masks, with a futuristic vibe like Marine Serre, or for pollution protection. Now, masks have become nearly ubiquitous, not to mention models with veiled faces (as at Thom Browne, Margiela and Victoria/Tomas), or swathed with scarves (Marni) or hidden behind balaclavas, like the metallic ones at Paco Rabanne. For some labels, for example Rick Owens and Eckhaus Latta, every single model trod the runway wearing a mask.

2 Self-protectionThe idea of self-protection was popular with a number of designers, considering also the need to respect social distancing. A concept that translated into scores of silhouettes hidden behind veils, while some labels developed shelter-style outfits (like Kenzo and Anrealage) and even armoured ones, like Paco Rabanne's long metallic dresses, covering the body from top to bottom. Givenchy featured stiff, square mini-capes with boxy shoulders, enveloping the upper part of the models’ bodies in a protective cocoon. Prada models were swathed in oversize stole-capes, while Fendi opted for comforters.

3. Total looks Next summer's collections are truly cutting to the chase, featuring essentials with an emphasis on simplicity and an uber-minimal style, more so than ever. In many cases, all the clothes and accessories for the majority of looks featured the same colour or printed pattern. Or better, the same non-colour, like white or black. As was the case for Thom Browne’s summer wardrobe, which was all white, from head to toes! This kind of total look is ideal for uniform-style women's outfits, especially the omnipresent trousers suit.

4. Black and whiteBlack and white combinations, in addition to total looks in white or black, were another aspect of next summer’s predominant minimalism. For example, in chequerboard or polka-dot motifs, prints, matching black and white items, and bi-colour dresses. Of course, this didn't stop designers from tapping a broad colour palette, especially in colour-block mode, featuring both intense and more watered-down hues, with aqua green highly popular.

5. CocooningLockdown and work-from-home situations have left an indelible trace on these summer 2021 collections, designed right in the midst of the pandemic. Although sportswear has been far less prominent on the catwalks in recent seasons, tracksuits and especially hoodies are making a remarkable come-back, and were featured even by a classic label like Max Mara. Also very popular were loungewear items like pyjama sets and dressing gown-style coats.
 
6. Maxi dressesGiven the prevalent cocooning mood, the notion of comfort has taken an even stronger hold, translating into an extensive array of long dresses, preferably ample and voluminous, suited to all sizes and occasions, all of them notable for their relaxed vibe: bohemian-style and country girl dresses, caftans, and highly practical tunics worn over trousers, another directional trend.

7. Genderless styleInclusivity and diversity have become key values for fashion labels. Underscoring this growing trend, models of all genders, sizes and origins are now seen on the catwalks. Wardrobe-wise, this trend was reflected in gendered outfits that were nevertheless wearable either by men or women, or in unisex clothes, as notably shown by Louis Vuitton, confirming the emergence of this long-term trend.

8. Crop tops and brasFrench high-school girls are currently baring their navels in protest against the ‘politically correct’ outfits they are required to wear at school and, unsurprisingly, crop and bra tops were ubiquitous on this autumn’s catwalks. Tops that leave the midriff bare attained the status of must-have item, and were featured in all collections. Even uber-chic labels like Hermès joined the fray, frequently combining sexy bra tops with demure suits.

9. Lace galoreDesigners are giving a fresh twist to grandmother-style lace decorations, delving into wedding trousseaux for embroidered sheets, spreads and doilies, not to mention curtains and crocheted bedspreads, with which to fashion their romantic wardrobes. Embroidered and macramé details, and lace flower appliqué, were featured on all kinds of summer dresses, skirts, trousers, tops and coats.

10. FluorescenceThe trend for fluorescent colours, first spotted on the Fall/Winter 2019-20 catwalks, is still going strong, and is ideal for energising outfits, as with the lime-coloured piping on a black lace dress at Francesca Liberatore. At labels like Akris and Anrealage, fluorescent hues added a playful touch, a light shining in the dark to illuminate our gloomy environment.

"Oct 15, 2020","The British Fashion Council is introducing a new format for The Fashion Awards this year with the December 3 event to be digital “in light of the restrictions imposed on large scale events and travel”.The BFC said it will recognise “designers, brands, creatives and individuals who have created positive change within the fashion industry this year”.

And the awards have evolved this year to put a bigger emphasis on doing good.That means highlighting “those who bravely faced this challenging period with pro-active responses to the global pandemic, showed leadership and creative resilience”, as well as those “who stood up against prejudice within the fashion industry” and fought for change. 

It’s particularly aiming “to shine a spotlight on those who made humanitarian efforts, adapted their business models and responded to their community’s needs”.

Twenty individuals and brands will be recognised and receive a ‘2020 Fashion Award’ in honour of their specific contribution. They’ll be announced as part of a short film “that will document the fashion industry in this extraordinary year, while bringing together a list of next-generation opinion leaders and creatives to share their personal vision on the most important moments of 2020”.

BFC chair Stephanie Phair said that in “a year like no other, businesses and designers have had to adapt to a new reality. It is more important than ever to recognise those in the fashion industry who played an important role in this extraordinary year, proving the compassion and resilience of our industry”.

And CEO Caroline Rush added that it’s been clear in 2020 that “the fashion industry is in need of a reset” and so it was “was important to recognise the people and businesses who played a role in some of the most important and challenging issues of our generation and champion those who raised the bar in areas such as diversity, sustainability, and community”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 14, 2020","As Covid-19 continues to push major fashion events online, Teen Vogue has unveiled a virtual version of its Generation Next Class of 2020 Presentation Week. The program, first launched in 2019 under Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner, provides mentorship and networking opportunities to up-and-coming fashion designers. This year's class consists of five designers, including New York-based designers Sheena Sood, founder of Abacaxi, and Edvin Thompson, founder of New York-based brand Theophilio, as well as London-based designers Elliss Solomon, founder of Elliss; Tolu Coker, founder of the namesake brand Tolu Coker; and Krystal Paniagua, founder of the eponymous brand, Krystal Paniagua.  

Marking the second iteration of the initiative, the 2020 presentation week will run from October 12 to October 15 and will include short film presentations from each 2020 class designer, accompanied by lookbooks of each designer's favorite New York City muses in hand-selected pieces from their collections, Teen Vogue said.

"Oct 14, 2020","Whoever said that masks couldn't be stylish was definitely overlooking the overflowing imagination and creativity of your favorite designers and labels. While masks featuring logos and matching prints of outfits are nowadays legion, a new arrival in the realm of pandemic fashion could well ""break the internet"" -- the mask dress, a combination of trend and practicality.Due to the pandemic, protective masks have quickly become stylish, indispensable accessories, even though many wearers opt for surgical ones. One need only type the keyword in a search engine to discover the variety of different masks on offer, from customizable to luxury ones, including fun patterns and stylish designs. Ready-to-wear brands are surfing the trend and regularly coming up with attractive new models. One example is the Off-White logo masks, which have been the trendiest fashion accessories for the first two 2020 quarters, according to Lyst data.

While wearing a face mask is mandatory in most cities worldwide, some brands are taking the essential one step further by offering models to match wedding dresses, complete looks or even Halloween costumes. In the past few weeks, visor-type shields mounted on bucket hats have also been spotted, but the must-have in this area of fashion is a high collar dress that serves as sexy garment but also as covid-19 protection.Retailer PrettyLittleThing is currently generating buzz after having unveiled several colorways of its bodycon mask-dress including gray, blue, leopard print and black, which can double as a ""Catwoman"" look. The long-sleeved dress is absolutely inseparable from its mask, which is rather convenient, however no mention is made of whether it complies with health norms required to avoid contamination.

While it may not be elegant or even align with the casual chic trend that is very of the moment, this jersey dress, selling for around $19, is not only selling out online, it  could very well inspire other brands and designers to come up with other approaches, such as a pantsuit integrating a mask. Certain Spring/Summer 2021 shows have already explored the mask as part of fashion recently, such as those by Marine Serre and Paco Rabanne. Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Oct 12, 2020","The cottagecore aesthetic, which implies notions of nature, rusticity and romanticism, has invaded social media with billions of cottagecore hashtags shared worldwide by many women. The trend has now spread to maternity clothing.Can we expect a coronavirus baby boom in the coming months after weeks of lockdown? It's too early to predict such a phenomenon, however, fashion research platform Stylight, has analyzed fashion trends of women who are expecting and ""momfluencers"" and showed that maternity clothing has experienced a 79% surge in clicks last summer in comparison with the previous year.Ultra-stylish moms-to-beAn increasing number of trend-driven brands are offering wide ranges of contemporary and fashionable maternity garments for every style. And a major trend this season for moms-to-be is cottagecore, with a growing number of fans worldwide, in particular since stay-at-home measures have become the norm amidst the global health crisis. 

The trend ischaracterized by floral dresses, lace, transparent fabrics as well as heavier materials with a handcrafted look. Stylight highlights a surge of 425% in clicks on clothing of these styles this year and cites many pregnant celebrities as sources of inspiration for web users.

Among the other trends that emerged from the platform for maternity style, Stylight spotlighted leather jackets (+251%), polka-dot blouses (+229%), polka-dot dresses (+185%), and dresses with big collars (+76%). Stylight also noted that crop tops are a favorite piece for moms-to-be to show off their baby bump (+20%).

Stylight also recently published figures concerning the popularity of famous pregnant women with those online. Nicki Minaj ranks highest with the most Google searches, with 246,000 monthly searches for the terms ""Nicki Minaj pregnancy."" Gigi Hadid (201,000 searches) holds second place, ahead of Sophie Turner, Emma Roberts, Leighton Meester, and Ciara.

"Oct 12, 2020","Toronto’s alternative arts and fashion week, Fashion Art Toronto, is going digital October 15 through Monday October 26, under a new format dubbed 'Virtual Fashion Week'. The 12-day online “fashion extravaganza” will be broadcasted on Fashion Art Toronto’s Instagram (@fashionarttoronto), and will feature 25 Canadian designers who will showcase their collections at iconic locations around the city of Toronto.

“We’ve really had to think outside the box and completely reinvent the format of Fashion Art Toronto this year, and it’s going to be an incredible season,” said Vanja Vasic, founder and executive director, Fashion Art Toronto.“We’ve created an engaging live virtual format that will share fashion through spectacular runway shows held at cool urban backdrops – plus we’ll be streaming a ton of creative behind-the-scenes content such as interviews, footage of models getting ready and more leading up to each show.”

Each day, a couple of virtual runway presentations will be shared via Instagram and will feature contemporary and experiential collections from designers and brands like vintage-upcycling brand House of Mannon, who will kick off the show on October 15, as well as womenswear designer, Nova Chiu; streetwear brand, Silent Simon; Kosmos Couture, and many more. 

Urban landscapes across Toronto will provide the backdrop for the runway shows, including The Bentway, Nathan Phillips Square, Ontario Place, the Ontario Science Centre and Toronto Music Gardens.

The finale on October 26 will be a takeover from Ryerson University and will feature collections from graduates of the Fashion program, at different sites throughout the Ryerson campus.

Considering viewers don’t have to buy tickets for this year’s iteration of Fashion Art Toronto, they are encouraging viewers to donate to FoodShare Toronto through a Fashion Art Toronto GoFundMe page.

The annual multi-arts fashion festival has long been dedicated to celebrating contemporary art and design through runway shows, live performances, fashion films, photography exhibits and art installations. 

“This has been a really challenging time for events and creatives alike, but often a crisis creates opportunity. The virtual format has allowed us to simultaneously promote fashion as well as celebrate the beautiful city of Toronto, while also allowing Fashion Art Toronto to reach a wider more global audience,” added Vasic. 

“We are just so happy that we can continue to provide our platform for designers and artists in a way that’s safe but still creative and engaging.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 12, 2020","Video social media platform TikTok has announced a new initiative to spotlight its Black creators. Named 'Black History, Black Present and Black Future,' the campaign will launch this month and ""[bring] key conversations in the Black community to the forefront of TikTok,"" through livestreams, as well as through the hashtag #myroots -- an in-app and advertising campaign that celebrates the unique stories and histories of the Black community on TikTok. Some popular Black fashion TikTokers set to be featured include David Fadd, Violet Ezedimora, Estare, Mack Peters, and Wisdom Kaye. 

The campaign will continue throughout October, and will include seven live discussions covering topics like Black hair, beauty and fashion; mental health; Black history in the school curriculum, as well as spotlighting comedy, entrepreneurship and gaming across the Black community, the company said. Featured guests will include TV presenter, June Sarpong; make-up artist, Anne Olayinka; social commentator, Patrick Philip Vernon OBE; comedians, Chanté Joseph and Munya Chawawa; and entrepreneur and Capital Xtra DJ, Remel London. 

The live videos can be watched on the @tiktok_uk page.

The initiative's launch comes after TikTok was accused this past summer of shadow banning creators posting Black Lives Matter content. At the start of June, TikTok released an apology to its Black creators, addressing those who ""have felt unsafe, unsupported, or suppressed.""

The company also announced a donation of $4 million to organizations committed to supporting the Black community. 

More recently, TikTok has made headlines for facing a ban in the U.S. after the government accused the Chinese-owned app of being a national security risk. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 8, 2020","Without question this has been the strangest season in fashion in the past half-century, where in the midst of the pandemic, designers have been busy asking themselves what the point of their profession is. In Paris, the French call this ""une remise en question,"" which roughly translates as questioning your own existence. And creative directors from giant brands to fledgling start-ups have responded frequently by returning to their youth and what inspired them to be designers in the very first place.

The results were some highly personal collections, which can be divided into two strangely complementary camps: romantic escapism, and clothes of high quality made with sustainable methods and fabrics. FashionNetwork.com reckons the following collections – whether shown online, in private presentations, via pre-prepared videos or in actual old-fashioned, live catwalk events – were the top 20 collections in fashion this past month.Christian Dior: Feminist fashion in a cathedral
One almost genuflected entering the stage set of Christian Dior, when creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri unleashed her latest feminist fashion opus, in a tent done up as an arty cathedral  in the Tuileries Garden. Inspired by Chiuri’s meeting with Lucia Marcucci, and the artist’s project ""Vetrata di poesia visiva,"" meaning ""Visual Poetry in Stained Glass."" Each window frame in Dior’s sacred setting captured words and reflections on women, and great works of Renaissance and modern art featuring women. Each bold new look – in a series of ikat paisley-pattern coats – cut in a forgiving yet sensuous silhouette. Elegant feminist fashion at its most private and vivid, in the latest great statement by Chiuri.
 
Koché: Cool resistance in a Paris park
No one blends athletic sportswear with French street couture like Christelle Kocher. An indie trend-setter and great showwoman, she set her live show inside the Buttes-Chaumont, a fantastic Paris park with steep cliffs and charming follies. Accompanying her cast with a quartet of bagpipes in full belt, adding a grandeur to this collection, which felt like a celebration of life after the darkness of the lockdown. The atmosphere was optimistic even in a steady drizzle. Slip dresses made in football team stripes; denim negligee dresses; athletic bras and boxer shorts trimmed with lace and marvelous hoodie cocktails done in paisley jacquard.""Why I am doing a fashion show? Well… It’s a matter of resistance. It’s a matter of emotion. It’s about being alive,"" said Kocher, summing up the remise en question that was the leitmotif of this season.
 
Coperni: Streamlined chic at Montparnasse Tower
French duo Coperni designed an excellent collection this season, and staged it in the driving rain on the on the rooftop of the Montparnasse Tower. Just 32 looks, opening with Edie Campbell in an all-white ensemble of micro-bomber jacket and stretch jodhpurs. Sculpted cocktails, sleek architectural suits and great off-the-shoulder shirts; along with what they called 3D fabrics, like knitted stretch. And one stunning all turquoise ensemble – featuring leggings, zippered windcheater jacket and matching chador – Olympic Games cool. And a great way to celebrate Cathy Freeman, the Aboriginal Baha’i believer who won the 400 meters gold 20 years ago this month in Sydney with her head fully covered.Simone Rocha: Jane Austen meets Catherine de' Medici
Jane Austen met Catherine de' Medici in the most dramatic collection of the season in London. High ethereal romanticism from Simone Rocha at her best. A social media ""Sharing Today"" event for a small audience of editors, buyers and pals in a Mayfair gallery that opened with divine ballgowns cut to envelop the shoulder in clouds of taffeta or cloqué. An almost sacred atmosphere enhanced by the color palette, which Rocha described with a biblical reference as ""amber, gold & myrrh.""

Akris: phosphorescent minimalism
Switzerland’s most inventive fashion house took a novel approach to fashion this season, with no live show in Paris, nor any typical clothes video. Instead, designer Albert Kriemler formed  a triumvirate – finding inspiration from the great German abstract minimalist artist Imi Knoebel, and then artfully recorded that collaboration in a film shot by Dutch filmmaker Anton Corbijn. The five-minute film was shot in a Dusseldorf studio before some of Knoebel's greatest works, like ""Raum 19,"" a series of often massive cardboard shapes and boxes in unexpected demi-geometrical forms. Using Knoebel's late '90s paintings as designs for leather totes and fantastic tunic dresses, phosphorescent lace pantsuits and trench-coats in front of his sculptures, in the newest twist to the ennobling modernist fashion that is Akris.
 Erdem and Emma
A beguiling video show inside a tree-lined park, referencing the love triangle in 18th-century Naples between Emma Hamilton, her husband and the legendary Horatio Nelson. Emma in the Bourbon court of Naples was attired in Directoire-style high-waisted dresses, Grecian goddess silhouettes and simple light-weight chemises thrown over the shoulder. Hair worn loose, pearls in ears, ribbons flowing from many collars and lapels, bows jutting out: the latest stylish collection from designer Erdem Moralioglu, who references the past even as he overthrows history with his revolutionary ideas.

Molly Goddard: Phygital fun
Molly had a phygital show for a succinct and sexy collection, in an art gallery, with gals striding along an all-white mini catwalk. Goddard wraps women up in oodles of puckered, gathered and ruffled fabrics, but they always look alluring, never prim. Her clothes are Instagram eye-catching but always cool, from the baby-doll-pink dresses, to the pinafores worn over baggy pants, to the splendid Victorian rocker femmes fatales in uber bright pop-art colors. No lockdown can stymie Goddard’s joie de vivre. 

Marrknull invents edgy nobility
A windy quarry, with a score of Asian gals strolling hair astray on a ridge. All looking like they had been out all night partying. One long fabulous final drone shot captures the whole scene, as a juggernaut truck swings around the ridge where the models stand in formation. Voluminous asymmetrical blouses, waxed patent-leather cocktails, darling deconstructed trousers – in one of the most inventively cut collections in ages. A unisex ready-to-wear brand from Beijing, founded by Wang Wei and Tim Shi, Marrknull is all about recomposing Chinese traditional clothing with a deconstructed bedraggled grace. All told, a brilliantly succinct vision of edgy nobility.
 
Marni: Artisanal imagination
Francesco Risso had a live concept show which didn’t really come off. Shooting a score or more of pals in over a dozen cities, partly styling themselves in a weird variety of locations. However, the actual collection, the fruit of many months of his team hunkering down alone like old-fashioned artisans in Milan, was rather magical. Intense abstract expression prints; out-of-focus stripes; masterly bold graphics and posh-hippie graffiti texts – all used in trenches, giant coats, asymmetrical cocktails and upside-down athletic tops. A reminder that the lockdown allowed the most fertile fashion mind in Milan – Francesco Risso – to unleash his imagination.
 
Versace: Sea, sex and sun
Sea, wind and storms on the soundtrack – and talk about a great set! An ancient Roman ruin, Pompei in Milan, with statues of Hercules and imperious emperors, meter-wide Medusa heads, fallen Corinthian capitals and an audience of barely a hundred perched on mini fluted columns. The cast marching around a sandy floor in one of Donatella's strongest ever collections.

Girls in pants slit along the waistline; slinky blazers with crystal starfish brooches; beautiful graphic blouses; retro computer graphic skirts cut just below the knee. Guys in crisp suits with oversized jackets, techy tops with tie-patterns, pinstripe platform flares, and multicolored beach windbreaker stripes. Tip-top accessories, from the patent leather platforms finished with thick gold chains, to the electric blue and Day Glo orange nylon satchels. All ending with excellent clubbing gear in a great new Versace seashell and seashore print seen in leggings, barely-there bomber jackets, rapper shorts and track suits, not to mention the saucy crystal micro bras.

Donatella – in the new print – took her bow, leading out a quintet of besuited rock gods with slicked back hair. Nouveau athleticism for the fit and fabulous.Yohji Yamamoto: Drapes like the devil
Those wanting to behold a pure statement of fashion creation attended the latest show by Yohji Yamamoto. Due to the pandemic there was actually only one proper runway show in Paris Fashion Week on a wet Friday. Yamamoto made sure it was a great one. Presented with élan inside the giant gilded Salle des Fêtes of Paris' City Hall, the perfect juxtaposition to an entirely black and white collection.
 
Few people anywhere can drape like Yamamoto, who sculpted, wrapped and hung intricate shards of silk and fine wool around his angelic cast. Before going on a prolonged spasm of activity at the finale, using hangers and raw wire crinolines to make fabric practically explode off the models’ torsos. A salutary lesson from the samurai of chic with multiple devilishly well-cut clothes.
 
Emporio Armani: Building bridges
Giorgio Armani skipped any physical presentation during Milan Fashion Week, but that did not prevent his video display for Emporio Armani from packing plenty of oomph and punch. Armani named the video ""Building Dialogues"" and shot it in his Milan headquarters, a former Nestlé chocolate factory reinvented by master architect Tadao Ando, and Armani/Silos, his art and fashion exhibition space across the street.
 
Giorgio’s famous non-color palette of chalk, putty, stone and light mud have rarely looked better, seen here before the elegantly austere rationalist-style buildings. Next summer Armani wants gals to dress in Emporio’s black and white Holstein-print rawhide jackets and blousons, perfectly cut black-and-gray chalk-stripe suits, halter-neck summer frocks, and mannish deep-gorge pantsuits.
 
Health concerns regarding travelling made the 86-year-old designer create an alternative form of show, one ""to reach as many members of the public as possible,"" and the net result was one of his bravest Emporio collections ever.

Dries Van Noten: Len Lye lithe
Like at the summer menswear season, the Belgian designer showed a short video. Fortunately, this one had plenty of kick. Entitled ""Video,"" by Viviane Sassen, it featured whirling dervishes of models in an Amsterdam studio, done like a hipster club with light projections. Van Noten referenced flapper dresses, boxy colonial officer looks and delightfully bright fencing shirts. For guys, camp shorts with lots of metallic tags, and skinny techy mess tops.

Though the key elements were the prints, which took this collection somewhere new. Working with the foundation of New Zealand artist and filmmaker Len Lye, who experimented with dyes, stencils, air-brushes, felt-tip pens and even surgical instruments, Van Noten developed a mesmerizing array of new psychedelic hues and blotched colors that showed the designer doing what he does best – crossing smart novel tailoring with his skills as a master printmaker. Punchy escapism at its best.
 
Hermès: Quality on a mountain top
A purist celebration of the French love of spectacle at Hermès, and the most skillfully staged show on the international calendar. Unveiled inside the Tennis Club de Paris, revamped into a mountain with ridges that rolled up into the ceiling of the brutalist concrete structure. A mountain made of white plaster cast, interspersed with giant plinths featuring images of ceramic icons, moody gods, and photos of the actual collection.
 
Designer Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski’s response to the pandemic was hyper quality, expressed in reduced adornment and unfussy styling: ideal mannish blazers, minimalist fisherman gilets or low-waist skirts in leathers so smooth they looked to be made of steel. Refined dusters, knotted-at-the-side dresses or neat blousons in double-face cashmere that called to be caressed. Exiting the pandemic, Vanhee-Cybulski sought out pure quality – durable fashion that will last for years.
 
Acne Studios: Turrell in the Grand Palais’ turrets
This will sound like a backhanded compliment, but I never thought I would write that Acne Studios was one of the 20 best shows on the planet in any given season. However, Jonny Johansson's latest collection for the Swedish brand was unquestionably an important event. Its big idea was the play of light on clothes and culture, echoing the ideas of James Turrell. Working with reflective materials, Johansson developed an intriguing collection of ceremonial clothes: wrap blouses with sleeves that ended six inches past the finger tips; marvelous cable knits with giant Jesuitical sleeves; oversized mannish crushed-cotton ecru blazers. Or semi-sheer chiffon tube dresses, tunics and swing skirts that caught the soft, key and ambient lighting. Even the handbags and clutches came with five-inch-wide, one-meter-long straps. Presented to groups of 30 editors and influential folk, in three faux galleries, illuminated with cinematic lighting. All within the Galerie Courbe of the Grand Palais. An unexpected fashion moment, by a designer to be reckoned with.Balmain: Logomania for a virtual front row
J.Lo, Penelope Cruz and a gang of editors showed up in Paris once this season – if only virtually – at the latest Balmain show. Each on their own flat screen, projecting them watching from the comfort of their own home or offices – from Beijing and Milan to London and New York. Allowing them, and several of their dogs, to witness Olivier Rousteing’s logo-drenched vision for Balmain. Catching a powerful fashion statement from Rousteing, where every second look featured a dense archive logo print. Seen in pagoda-shoulder tuxedos, naughty dressing gowns and femme fatale cocktails for gals, or rock dandy blazers, lounge suits and award-winning smoking jackets for dudes.

Paco Rabanne is relevant again
Designer Julien Dossena staged a series of mini live shows inside Espace Commines in the Marais, rebuilt inside as a large silver cylinder. What soundtrack there was came interrupted by dogs barking, honking car horns, police sirens and the yells of street photographers outside. Silver slip dresses finished with bodices and strips of leopard skin underneath. Beautiful pink slip negligees with dentelle tops, often worn under gentlemanly eight-button mini redingotes or Space Age sleeveless hussar jackets. The audience perched on metal stools, admiring the bravura finale – a series of gold or silver dresses made of shards of metallic plastic or oversized sequins.

In a word, Dossena is France’s most happening designer. Someone who has managed to breathe life into a brand that had been regarded as a charming retro relic. Today, thanks to Dossena, Paco Rabanne is relevant and even revolutionary.

Miu Miu: Olympic gold medal winners get Italian makeover
After showing Prada and her debut with Raf Simons, in Milan, Miuccia Prada unveiled Miu Miu 12 days later in Paris. Both collections were presented online and also in several cities to select groups of senior fashionistas at chic lunches. Inevitably, the question was: would Miuccia have a better collection working alone, or with Raf? On the basis of this one season, it is definitely Miu Miu – sexy, sporty, athletic chic at its best. Trackpants, taut blousons, miniskirts, sleek shorts and leotards were the heart of the collection. East German Olympic gold medal winners given a glam Italian makeover. All finished with great gusto by faux diamante trim, crystal collars and dazzling bugle beads. Unveiled in the latest Miu Miu Club, a naïve futurist setting with a score of fans – Brigitte Lacombe, Malgorzata Szumowska and Erin O’Connor – watching the show live like figure skating judges. And the winner is – Miuccia.

Maison Margiela: Tango Parisien
John Galliano promised viewers that his goal was to create a ""luxury genderless wardrobe,"" for Maison Margiela, in a virtual reportage entitled ""S.W.A.L.K. II."" Speaking about a ""video filled with love,"" in a virtual conversation with Nick Knight and hair stylist Eugene Souleiman, before viewers were led into a tango lesson on a youthful cast dancing before the mood board of next Spring-Summer 2021.

Galliano's inspiration: a voyage to Buenos Aires, the working class neighborhood of La Boca, where so many houses are painted in bright colors, and the discovery of his first tango bar. Sitting in his own drawing room, before oil portraits, the English couturier recalled a ""dilapidated garage with wild cats running around under moonlight in a private Tango club. Before an 80-year-old began dancing."" The memory of that figure in creased clothing, accompanied by an accordion and shot by Knight.

The actual clothes were slouchy Argentine style suits, padded trenches, sweaters worn under suspenders and inside-striped pants. Women in blood red silk flared frocks, ideal for dancing, and deconstructed jackets and cut-out trenches. Often with numbers on their backs, competing like in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?

The cast eventually dancing around the all-white studio of the headquarters of Margiela in the 11th arrondissement in this 44-minute opus, before ending their activities in a wedding day orgy under pouring rain. Enjoyable, frolicking and enthusiastic, even if a tad too self-indulgent, this was the video where one got to see the most of any collection this season. And, this  ""garçonniere"" aesthetic made the clothes some of the wickedest anywhere.
 
Louis Vuitton
Last but not least: blurred gender bending from Nicolas Ghesquière at Louis Vuitton, who developed a bold vernacular to address the slowly melting division between men and women in a powerful final runway show that brought an end to Paris Fashion Week.

Little politics on any runway this season, especially in Paris, but at least Ghesquière made his opinions clear. His opening model wore a loose white sweatshirt with graffiti script reading ""Vote."" Others had great explosive street graphics saying – ""Drive,"" ""Hooks"" or ""Dunce"" in macho racecar colors. Punchy designs used in taut cocktails under some great voluminous spy heroine coats.

Repeatedly cutting with bravura – fantastic mannish low-waisted double-breasted coat-dresses; and the best pants anywhere this season – billowing men’s trousers with ruffled trim, worn with officers' mess jackets. While his bomber-meets-spy-trench-coats will be huge hits – for guys and girls.

Ghesquière returning to his avant-garde roots on the top floor of the new concept department store, Samaritaine, on the Seine.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 8, 2020","Paris had scores of presentations this season, as smaller houses skipped actual runway events, and organized appointments with designers by rendez-vous. All of them offered opportunities to see clothes up close and personal with the creators – from the bohemian Marais to the posh 16th arrondissement.

Here are three contrasting collections, which collectively captured the unique ability of Paris to offer so many different voices in the world of style. Olivier Theyskens: French rock-goddess chic 
Mylène Farmer to the max this season at Olivier Theyskens, who harked back to the costumed French rock goddess of his youth in an excellent new collection.Like so many designers, Theyskens is referencing his youth, and getting back to basics with the pandemic: in Olivier’s case, when he was barely 10, and Farmer exploded all over French TV with her historic videos clips.
 
“Actually, people used to tease me for being a little naff for liking Mylène Farmer, but she encompasses a lot of what the Theyskens woman represents. Guts, character, style and independence,” explained Theyskens, who showed at his new pop-up store and atelier in a gallery in the Marais. The Belgian enfant terrible of sexy goth style has been moving spaces and showrooms over the past few months, before landing up in an elongated loft on at the eastern end of rue Réaumur.
 
From his signature seductive gothic widows in pleated Cupro gowns or slinky after-midnight cocktails to suggestive bias-cut dresses or tight leather posh dominatrix looks, Farmer would surely love this homage. Come to think of it Mylène, who made the most expensive French rock videos ever, and who still holds the record for most number ones in the local charts, should really record another opus, to give Theyskens' latest ideas their proper backdrop. 
 Minuit: French girls in New YorkOne new marque that really made a mark, excuse the pun, is Minuit, launched this season in the Marais by a Parisian duo who cut their design teeth in Manhattan.
 
A cool meeting of relaxed sophistication; lush fabrics and French je ne sais quoi, Minuit debuted its first collection in an art gallery in the Marais this past week.
 
It’s the brainchild of Laurie Arbellot, lives in Paris, and Marion Anais Forand, who lives in Williamsburg. They met while working at America’s most prominent new fashion house of the past 15 years, Proenza Schouler. And their designs have something of the modern chic of that New York house; a blend of downtown cool with uptown attitude.
 
Made of first-rate Italian fabrics, Minuit showed great indented cloqué silk pant suits; darn well draped tangerine velvet suede pants and bras; surgically cut mini boleros; saucy black negligée dresses with chain metal straps and great décolleté cotton blouses.
 
It all reeks rather rich, without even being uptight. The message was clear and concise - French girls cut a swathe in New York. Zadig & Voltaire: Laid-back sustainability 
Zadig & Voltaire’s designer Cecilia Bönström showed her latest ideas in a loft space in the tony 16th, with views over the rooftops to the Eiffel Tower, albeit during one of the wettest Paris Fashion Weeks in eons.
 
But there was nothing damp about Bönström's take on French rocker style, which the creative director termed: 'The Real Wardrobe, Sustainable Edition.' A pianist played jazzy sonatas with bursts of  Cole Porter as the hot-looking cast wandered around the art filled top-floor loft. Other youths wrote the names of visiting editors rune-style on pebbles as neat gifts for visitors to the space on rue Galilée.
 
“I wanted a fully eco-responsible collection,” explained the designer, who showed repurposed cotton T-shirts and recycled wool tanks in a veritably androgynous style. For spring-summer 2021, Cecilia wants guys and dolls in her oversized boyfriend sweaters, all held a little askew by safety pins; great track pants and shirts with extended cuffs; trousers cut with horizontal slits at the waistline and girls' white daytime tuxedos.

Back in the Bible, Jesus walked on the water in the Sea of Galilee; and was even able to feed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fish. We’re not suggesting Bönström, or Zadig & Voltaire, have these sort of powers. But at the very least it will make a lot of youth look and feel better about themselves. Which, lest we forget, is slightly the whole point of fashion.

"Oct 6, 2020","With the line between women and men increasingly blurred in society today, leave it to Nicolas Ghesquière to develop a fashion vernacular that addressed that slowly melting division in a powerful final runway show that brought an end to this Paris Fashion Week.A co-ed Spring-Summer 2021 show, and a blend of adventurous, mannish tailoring for women and women’s fabrics and finish for the men, in a striking collection presented on the top floor of Samaritaine, the latest path-breaking real estate project by LVMH.
 
Located on the banks of the Seine, the entire development also includes a five-star Cheval Blanc hotel looking down on the Pont Neuf and a giant experiential shopping emporium built in a landmark Art Nouveau former department store.There has not been a lot of politics spoken about in Paris this season, but at least Ghesquière made his opinions clear. His opening model wore a loose white sweatshirt with graffiti script reading ""Vote."" Others had great explosive street graphics saying – ""Drive,"" ""Hooks"" or ""Dunce"" in macho racecar colors. Many punchy designs used in taut cocktails under some great voluminous spy heroine coats. 
 
""Stepping into a territory that is still stylistically vague. A sensitive zone that erases gender and promises exponential creative possibilities. What does an in-between garment look like? What kind of cut can dissolve masculine and feminine?"" wondered the 49-year-old Ghesquière in his program notes.
 Repeatedly, the Vuitton designer cut with bravura – fantastic mannish low-waisted double-breasted coat-dresses; and the best pants anywhere this season – billowing men’s trouser with ruffled trim, worn with officers' mess jackets. While his bomber-meets-spy-trench-coats will be huge hits.
 
The designer garnered major applause at both his shows this afternoon, with a slew of bold face names in the front-row – Alicia Vikander, Léa Seydoux, Venus Williams, Laura Harrier, Chiara Mastroianni, Natalia Vodianova, Marina Foïs, Olympia of Greece, Hugo Marchand and Woodkid.
 
Plus, whoever does Vuitton’s casting deserves a gold medal. In a season which introduced a whole new generation of young catwalk talent – since Covid-19 prevented supermodels from flying – no house had as rich a group of vital new runway faces.
 
In a neat ploy, this season Ghesquière’s famed signature tied-up Parisian belt was finished with huge military grommets. And even if Ghesquière was not the only designer to show dense micro-sequin looks, his had the most impact. Moreover, his marbleized tuxedos for guys looked sensational – especially seen against the all green backdrop and towering murals of the 19th century store’s murals of peacocks. ""There are 20 million people every year that walk from Notre Dame to the Louvre, and this place is right in between the two of them. En route, people can walk over Pont Neuf, the most photogenic bridge in the world. What’s there not to like!"" smiled Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke.
 
Samaritaine will certainly be a new shopping concept: a blend of unique architecture, high-end shopping experiences and a culinary emporium. Its top floor will have a half-dozen restaurants, many offering exceptional views over the Paris skyline, from the Louvre all the way to the Eiffel Tower and the the Sacré Coeur.
 
""This floor will be beautiful, a beehive of activity. Mark my words,"" nodded the CEO of Vuitton, whose house will have a key boutique in the complex. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 6, 2020","Few designers in Paris are more committed than Mossi, the winner of the latest prestigious ANDAM award, a creator whose whole raison d'être is about building a fairer society. 
Mossi staged his latest collection in the back of the 5th arrondissement where few shows are held, inside the headquarters of Paris Habitat – a key organization developing public housing in France.
 
In his brief career, Mossi has already helped open a school for young designers in Villiers-sur-Marne, a distant Paris suburb, and collaborated with several highly respected couture houses. Moreover, in the era of Black Lives Matter, many people in France would love to discover a champion black designer in the new generation.Mossi, of dreadlocked gentlemanly lithe young man of Malian origin, certainly fits the profile. So, a small gang of Paris editors showed up for this show, which we are happy to report was a pretty impressive display. Mossi is an adept cutter and his lean silhouettes were flattering and real. Cleverly draped asymmetrical apron skirts; rippling chiffon dusters; a marvelous transparent gauze trench with golden lapels and cuffs and sleeveless halter neck floor-length downtown Grand Dame looks. Add in some great plissé tunics overlaid with muslin and a wonderful printed Japanese organza top with prints by Iraqi artist Hassan Massoudy’s calligraphy and you had an impressive display of grown up but never uptight Parisian style. All skillfully styled by Paris hippest stylist of color and black militant, Ahmed Jenke Tailly.
 
“Movement. In the clothes, in the patterns. But also in society and on the streets. That was were I started,” said Mossi after his show staged with great simplicity in the glass atrium of Paris Habitat. 
 
What’s best about Mossi is that he connects the craft of couture, with greater contemporary culture.  Even as he references Madame Grès, he sends out a team a break, and modern ballet, dancers.  
 
Movement too in the dancers who staged a great writhing and spinning mini routine to kick off the show, backed up by a soundtrack of fantastic French rap led by Ideal J’s Hardcore.
 
In a word, Mossi is sculptural street chic with a beat.

"Oct 5, 2020","Long before a lot of people could spell recycling, or even had any clue what it meant, Xuly Bet had single-handedly invented the concept – about 20 years ahead of his time. 
Now, it isn’t always very easy to catch the shows of many talented designers, notably those of Xuly Bet. This season, Bet staged his latest show in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb outside the Paris ring road, during rush hour on a Monday of heavy downpours. Admittedly the neighborhood does boast a zero-waste incinerator.
 
Yet a faithful posse of fans and editors made the trek along the river and over a railway bridge to the back-end of a station in teeming rain. On arriving inside a looming redbrick storage facility, everyone in masks, they perched on 1960s Formica chairs as the show began.Just as much as he eschews new materials, Bet likes a lived-in cast, or what the French call Un Casting Sauvage. This season the cast were primarily of people of color like himself, and practically no professional models.
 
The designer named this collection: Funkin’ Fashion Factory, which is exactly what it was. Jazzy tie jacquards in red and orange or green and blue rocking-horse patterns used in a mannish suits for women, or parkas and jumpsuits for guys. All paired with revamped track pants, or pumps with crocket trim.Though Bet’s best ideas are his signature remade Lycra cocktails with red trim, which on the right figure ooze downtown French chic. In case you didn’t get the idea,d several coats were embossed with gold or blood red resin texts reading Club Catalogue and Copyright Recycled.

All backed up by a dance rock soundtrack, including the fashion insiders’ favorite DJ Honey Dijon’s remix of Why.
 
Great to see the godfather of recycling back and being feted in Paris, after spending the past few years living in New York. Bet has been breathing new life into vintage clothing since the early 1990s. Rarely have they looked better.
 
“I felt it was important to assemble our world here. We need that raw feeling of a show. The sense of event, of coming together. It’s far more heart-warming than a video,” opined Bet, who took a jack-heeled bow, bouncing up and down among his cast as the crowd of 300 roared their approval.

"Oct 5, 2020","It felt as much like a happening as a fashion salon at Sphere, the new trade show for emerging talent that debuted in January and staged its latest edition this week in Paris. 
Featuring some celebrated young hopefuls and some truly novel faces, Sphere included nine designers from almost as many countries, including LVMH Prize winner Thebe Magugu; happening French label Boramy Viguier and cool Belarusian fashion project Boyarovskaya.
 
Each of the designers, who also included Germanier, Kenneth Ize, Mossi, Bluemarble, Egonlab and Mansour Martin – also showed videos. Many unveiled on specially arranged time slots with the Federation de la Haute Couture, French fashion’s governing body, which controls the official calendar of each Paris seasons. The federation also organizes the well-edited Sphere salon.
 
The live highlight of Sphere turned out to be Kenneth Ize, a 30-year-old Nigerian who unveiled his latest ideas before a live installation, a large mural painted live, where the images showed the actual clothes and models in the collection.
 
Born in Lagos, he studied in Vienna under Bernard Willem and Hussein Chalayan, before launching his own label. The younger son of two Nigerian immigrants to Austria who worked for Ikea, Ize moved back to Africa five years ago. Working with one main fabric, Aso Oke – a colorful woven in rayon and cotton, developed by the Yoruba people of West Africa.
 
“It takes five days to make one meter,” notes Ize, whose clothes however are made in plants in Italy.
 
He calls his silhouette 'Dictator Chic,' referring to the grand shoulders that riff on the strongmen who took over post-colonial Africa. His very cool multi-ethnic cast swarmed around a set, bedecked with flowers, dressed in bold striped waistcoats; flared pants or dandy belted safari jackets. All during the display, artists continued painting the mural of Mati, which featured characters in the current collection.
 “I wanted a culture in a loving space. And, I grew up in a Nigerian culture, where I never saw one flower in our Viennese living room,” said Ize, a fun-loving, voluble Nigerian, whose nail varnish is green; and his favorite drink is Guinness and tonic water.
 
His fellow African, Magugu, was unable to make it to Paris this season, but did unveil a brilliantly witty Indie spy movie video, named Counter Intelligence, about spies and counter-spies during the Apartheid era. One shirt Magugu showed was even made of a print based on the confessions of one real spy for the old regime.
 
Close by, one discovered Maria Boyarovskaya, who shows hyper adaptable clothes including a leather bomber jacket with its own strap to hang the garment over the shoulder. Echoes of constructivism meet minimalist rock-star chic in this  smart collection.
 
“We shot on the moon,” said Maria of her video, lensed on the volcanic soil of Lanzarote on the Canary Islands by her partner Artem Kononenko. A mutant-like model parades around the scorched earth vistas, an ideal setting for the Boyarovskaya look.
 
Sphere takes the place of a former salon, Designer Apartment. By adding a heftier emphasis on digital creation, and the support from wholesale online platform Le New Black, the federation has advanced this key developer of new talent to another level.

"Oct 5, 2020","Rihanna's beloved lingerie brand Savage X Fenty has revealed its expansion into men's underwear. The range of men's pieces, released as part of Savage X Fenty's fall/winter 2020 collection, includes boxers, robes, trunks and pajamas. Offered in styles meant to be gender-fluid, and colors including royal blue, black and red, the men's loungewear and underwear was designed in collaboration between Rihanna and Christian Combs, Sean 'Diddy' Combs' son. Previously during the brand's 2019 show, Combs made an appearance in custom, not-for-sale Savage X Fenty. 

Sizes for the new men's pieces range from small to 3XL, with prices ranging from $14.95 to $69.95. The new men's pieces made their public debut during the second ever Savage X Fenty fashion show, streamed on Amazon Prime Video and titled simply, 'Vol. 2.' Following the lauded premiere show from the lingerie brand, Vol. 2 delivered on similar blow-out performances from stars like Rosalía, Lizzo, Ella Mai, Travis Scott and Bad Bunny, as well as dance numbers and appearances from popular models and actors like Bella Hadid and Demi Moore. What the show lacked was a crowd -- as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic -- and the second show was filmed over the course of several days at the Los Angeles Convention Center with no audience.

"Oct 5, 2020","Designing denim would not normally seem the most apt way to become the designer at one of France’s great couture houses, but it is the career path of Matthew M. Williams, an American in Paris who showed his debut collection for the house of Givenchy on Sunday.
 Turns out it was perfectly good preparation for his new role, as Williams unveiled a perversely posh collection in unexpected materials with plenty of the classy glam and occasional downtown edge that characterized the style of Hubert de Givenchy.
 
Hence the presence of triple-baked pink denim jeans or crackled watermelon-hued jeans covered in machine washable resins. All set alongside some sleek, edgy tailoring.""I want to make clothing I really love, respecting the codes of the house while also making something modern, exciting and inclusive,"" said Williams, who has been working at the house for the past 90 days.
 
Born in Chicago, but raised in California, Williams is the sixth successor to de Givenchy, since Hubert retired in 1995. Williams grabbed attention in Paris three years ago, with a bold futurist street collection for his own label, 1017 Alyx 9SM, staged inside an empty building site in eastern Paris.
 
The American clearly has a fertile imagination. He showed a stunning silvery white coat, cut not with a collar, but with huge lapels, and held together with an athletic strap at the collar bones, made in silk organza overlaid with laser-cut silk.
 
He’s also taking plenty of risqué risks – like sheer columns dusted with crystal and metal snowflakes; or mini ponchos in snakeskin for women. While his menswear had a natty yet industrial feel, featuring plenty of articulated big buckle belts. 
Like Givenchy’s own legacy, Williams' vision of the house’s DNA is rather composite.
 
""It’s this idea of playing  with extremes, Hubert would take the most opulent embroidered and rich fabric and then work with something that was quite inexpensive. He was also the first person in couture into upcycling – like taking fabric from Schiaparelli, where he worked, and making it work for him in another context,"" said Williams.
 
""Also, [Givenchy] has this amazing place in fashion where there is haute couture and then a deep connection with pop culture and music and streetwear. So it’s a really a unique house to play on both of these worlds,"" added the designer, a 34-year-old father of three, currently sporting cropped dyed-white hair.
 
The other big news was the brilliant footwear – notably a Trip-toe shoe, so called due to the triple toe straps, which was completed with some delightfully diabolical horns and steel heels, first used by Alexander McQueen, Hubert's second successor. Pointy pumps also came emblazoned with silver hooks, while the guys wore some punchy thick tire warrior sandals.
 
Williams chose not to shoot a video, but did display a snappy look book, shot by Heji Shin, the New York-based German-Korean photographer, which were displayed on huge light panels inside the house’s grand showroom at 2 Avenue Montaigne, with mega views out through sunny showers to the Eiffel Tower.  
Shin’s images seem particularly adapted to Williams' take on Givenchy – graphic, self-assured, edgy and yet intimate.
 
His appointment at Givenchy is just the latest example of the ability of French luxury managers at LVMH to make courageous and risky choices when it comes to choosing designers for their stable of fashion houses.
 
Givenchy, let’s recall, will always be most famous for having dressed Audrey Hepburn when she played the part of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. At first sight, this collection seemed a long way from the iconic little black dress of that classic film. And yet, if that small-town southern gal who morphed into a party animal were alive today, we suspect she would love this collection.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 4, 2020","One house gaining lots of traction is Schiaparelli, where couturier Daniel Roseberry unveiled his latest ready-to-wear ideas on Sunday in a photo shoot he shot himself. 
Honing the house’s DNA and injecting lots of surrealist wit, Roseberry displayed lots of quirky takes on the classic Schiaparelli aesthetic, from snazzy tailoring to finger caps and mini lobster earrings, all while adding a novel dash of American sportswear.
 
For his debut shoot, Roseberry followed his own path from his apartment on Rue de Seine to Schiaparelli’s headquarters at Place Vendôme. Taking in some of his favorite Paris spots – from La Palette to Pont des Artistes and Café Voltaire on the Seine, including a charming salon with a Jean-Michel Frank mirror given as a present to Elsa.Roseberry unveiled three fashionable threads of thought: voluminous cocktails, nipped at the waist, which the couturier smiled and called, ""very Saint Laurent,"" and strict tailoring – like a mannish three-piece pantsuit, whose trim on one side was finished with a measuring tape, an old Schiap twist. Plus Daniel’s new American sportswear influence included fine wool sweatshirts – with an Elsa fetish, golden nipple rings – and great faded ecru jeans, with a half-dozen multiple golden back buttons.
 
Elsewhere he showered hardware over every cuff, lapel, neckline and button, cleverly imposing Schiaparelli semiotic signifiers with very few logos. Golden touches everywhere – seen on a sensationally well-cut tuxedo coat-dress worn with a giant derby hat, or on a see-through mesh top. Or with a chunky double chain necklace with a stoic goat with a mermaid’s tail pendant, worn with a femme fatale silk cocktail. While Roseberry’s golden toenail caps had diamond rings laced into them, and his finger rings were studded with mini locks.
 ""This was really just about capturing the Schiaparelli woman in her natural habitat. There were some moments in this shoot, when I really felt that I had really found her. I was really relieved. And I don’t know if I would have gotten there if I had let someone else take the photos. Finding that really modern approach to surrealism which felt fresh and very much her,"" explained Roseberry, who spent the lockdown in his downtown Manhattan apartment before making it back to Paris this summer.

The house also unveiled a video, a blend of making of from the shoot and Daniel sketching his ideas at the window of his truly luxurious corner office: the 18th-century north entrance to Jules Hardouin-Mansart’s beautiful Place Vendôme with a great view of Napoleon’s famous column. Watch the video and you'll agree; yes, it’s a tough job, but someone has got to do it.

"Oct 4, 2020","Paris Fashion Week loves few things more than a debut, and the biggest inauguration this season was the first French show of Gabriela Hearst.Very much regarded as one of the coolest new names to emerge in the New York scene this past half-decade, Hearst skipped the American season this autumn to come to Paris. She presented  inside the cloisters of the École des Beaux-Arts, her cast of 30 marching past a score of fine marble and stone statues. And statuesque is how the models looked in this very fine collection.
 
A key goal of contemporary fashion is to empower women, and few do this more so than Hearst, whose blend of New York sophistication and Latin American panache is a very winning and flattering formula.Her opening looks were in fine Napa leather; from cleanly cut bonded dresses to ideal workwear blazers with blanket stitching. For sunny evening fêtes, elegant fluid dresses and cocktails in ivory or white aloe linen – often trimmed with charming seashells. Punta del Este posh and polished, all the way to the great multicolored crocheted frocks and marvelous volcanic-hued tie-dye ensembles. 
 
Hearst is very much a lady born on the right side of the tracks – her father an important rancher in Uruguay, her husband scion of one of America’s wealthiest and most noted families. Yet she retains an honest earthiness, thanks to her rural roots, which makes her fashion and insistence on sustainability come across as real and true. And her brand and show supported a Verified Carbon Standard project to protect 100,000 acres of Peruvian rainforest near Machu Picchu, along with two native communities – Yine and Huitoto. 
 
""This collection was the self-conscious taking over. Trying to get through the pandemic, and work with feeling rather than any thoughts,"" said Hearst post show.A famously generous host, Hearst likes to serve lunch at her intimate shows, generally Uruguayan gaucho fare, which this Sunday meant tasty empanadas and barley risotto. The mood enhanced by a brilliant display from the great Spanish guitarist Leiva, who played a solo set at the cloisters fountain during the show.
 
Asked why it was important to come and show in Paris, she responded: ""To bring the team up. I didn’t want to stunt our creative growth and showing here ensured that.""
 
In a word, a completely successful entrance into Paris, by a house that seems poised for rapid growth.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 4, 2020","It was extraordinarily difficult for guests in Paris to see any clothes at the Ami show on the Seine on Saturday night yet, counterintuitively, the event felt like a triumph for the brand. 
The house’s founder and majority owner Alexandre Mattiussi invited the Gotha of hipster French fashion players on to a river boat to witness this Spring-Summer 2021 collection – Elle and Marie Claire editors-in-chiefs, self-satisfied Right and Left Bank influencers. Then he sailed them a few hundreds yards and anchored, creating a boatside front-row about 50 meters away from the cast. Who marched along the historic Quai Henri IV, where despite multiple arc and spot lights, most every model – seen from the vantage of the boat – was in the dark. Ami also projected the show in Times Square and almost certainly New Yorkers got a better look at the collection 3,625 miles away than any Parisians did.
 
And yet this show was a clever celebration of la mode parisienne. Precisely because it was a gutsy effort to celebrate life in the midst of the gloomiest year experienced by many people on our planet. So there was fist pumping and full-throated cheers when Mattiussi took his bow amid a line of 45 models along the river bank at 9.15 PM.Partly also because the backdrop shouted ""Belief in the Future!"" Two towering cranes above the soon-to-open David-Chipperfield-designed, 56-meter-high hotel, whose rooftop club will offer exceptional views. A formerly drab bureaucratic building being converted into a hip new space in City Hall’s Reinventing Paris project.
 
Thankfully, inside the péniche – that’s French for river boat – Alex had installed screens so one could actually see the collection. A mega-check array of polished but never uptight Parisian style, seen by hundreds of fans standing on bridge and riverbank.
 
""Paris belongs to everyone who loves it, so the idea of inclusion was at the heart of this show,"" explained the designer. 
 
For next summer’s parties, Ami would like gals to dress in fluid crepe halter-neck dresses, spruce blazers worn with below-the-knee skirts, voluminous ruffled shirt-dresses, military safari jacket dresses, or mega-polka-dot shorts. 
For guys – micro leather bomber jackets over tablecloth check shirts, Pacific blue calico pants with matching raincoats, and some attention-grabbing check dusters and linen suits.
 
Mattiussi rarely takes that many risks with his clothes; but generally does with his shows, staging them under bridges or in unexpected locations. And this season, with most people unable to see his collection, he managed to pull off, in the midst of another looming lockdown, a real fashion moment.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Oct 3, 2020","A purist fashion statement and a celebration of the French love of spectacle at Hermès on Saturday, in the most skillfully staged show so far on the international runway calendar.
 The house unveiled its Spring-Summer 2021 collection inside the Tennis Club de Paris, brilliantly revamped into a mountain with ridges that rolled up into the ceiling of the giant brutalist concrete structure. The structure was made of white plaster cast, courtesy of show producer Etienne Russo, and interspersed with giant plinths featuring the photography and imagery of artist Claudia Wieser – ceramic icons, moody gods, and photos of the actual collection.
 
The clothes themselves were altogether telling examples of uber luxurious fashion. Even though the cast marched 15 meters away from the audience, one could almost smell the rich quality of the supple lambskin and powdery cashmere. For if any luxury house is riding out the Covid downturn, it is Hermès, which in the past month alone has opened stores in Madrid, Osaka and Dalian, China, and invested in a new plant in Auvergne with jobs for 250 people.  
 
""There is a sense that this season in Paris is a lot about defending a certain French idea of a living spectacle. Of course, the pandemic means we have and will do many more things in digital. But at a certain point, a live expression of ideas is vital. Enough with Bluetooth, mobile phones and algorithms,"" sniffed Hermès women’s creative director Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski.
 
Pre show, Nadège sent editors a chic scrapbook, in 100% sweet-smelling recycled Freelife Cento paper, containing her visual collabs with artists she admires. From Vivier and the great Mitteleuropean abstractionist Carsten Fock to photographer Sam Rock and even master DJ Frédéric Sanchez, who sent over several dreamlike seascapes. As well as providing an anthemic backing track, sandwiching the soundtrack to Godard’s classic film Contempt with Mazzy Star’s ""Fade into You.""
 
Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski’s response to the pandemic was hyper quality, expressed in super clean lines, reduced adornment and unfussy styling: ideal mannish blazers, minimalist fisherman gilets or low-waist skirts in leathers so smooth they looked to be made of steel. Refined dusters, knotted-at-the-side dresses or neat blousons in double-face cashmere that called to be caressed. Mixed up with some smart leather chainmail dresses for editorial shoots. Where other designers have come out of the pandemic obsessed with protective clothing, masks and visors, Vanhee-Cybulski sought out the certainty of the familiar. The longing for long-lasting durable fashion whose quality will last for years. 
Like every show in Paris, Hermès scrupulously enforced social distancing. It is now a given, and has been since the end of the vacation, that every citizen, or visitor to France, wears a mask when they go outside or to any public event.
 
At every single show this week in Paris, gel is freely available and guests are sat more than one meter apart. If you want to get as far away as possible from a Republican Party rally, then find an invitation to a show in Paris Fashion Week.

"Oct 3, 2020","Jonathan Anderson’s latest show, this week for the Spanish label Loewe, came in an enormous cardboard box. It surely had couriers grumbling throughout Western Europe, as much as it delighted editors and fans in equal parts. 
Inside, one discovered a 68 x 94 cm artist’s portfolio, inside of which there were almost 20 sheathes of wallpaper, four times as large. Each featured photos of pals of Anderson in what he called a Show-on-a-wall.
 
An image of model Holly saw her in a sky blue schoolmarm dress, though finished with enormous leg-of-mutton sleeves. Another gal called Kristina in a vampy, micro-sequined, column that was cut away to the hip, like ""thousands of sequined disco lights,"" said Anderson in an accompanying video released Friday afternoon during Paris Fashion Week.Or there was Vittoria in a beige coat of enormous folds, worthy of a victorious samurai. She clutched the latest version of the soft and reduced Flamenco bag tied with an origami knot.
 
Many of the cast were fashion insiders – such as Laurence Kleinknecht for so long the faithful communications director of Hedi Slimane. Nobody looked quite as cool as Laurence in a Pacific blue gown with massive cape sleeves, that echoed Kansai Yamamoto as his best.
 
""Recontextualizing fashion. While travel is restricted we still want the viewer to participate. Forcing them to be creative and interact,"" explained Anderson. 
 
Where in previous seasons, for his own brand and Loewe, the designer had sent out books crammed with ideas, images, fabrics and prose. This season he wanted: ""Maxi – everything exactly life size.""
 
And genuine interaction. Along with the sheath of wallpaper we had an actual roll designed by Anthea Hamilton; plus, a brush, glue and a portable pail. For tricky angles in upper floor flats, a large pair of scissors for trimming.  Also inside was the score of ""Spem in Alium"" by Thomas Tallis, an ancient piece of music for forty voices.
 
The biggest news was the voluminous clothing, or what Jonathan called ""structured fluidity,"" stemming from his research into 18th-century shapes; glorifying hand-woven techniques and pushing forward with advanced embroidery.
             
""Buckled volume… that encompasses,"" added the designer, clearly searching for escapist clothing in this pandemic. Boldly working on advanced techniques like taking boning form the interior of dresses and using them on the outer edges of gowns to extend them away from the torso.
 
The final of the 120 x 178 cm sheaths was devoted to accessories, which have been an immense success story at Loewe, and burnished Anderson’s reputation within LVMH, which owns the Madrid-based brand. 
""Rediscovering our classics,"" said the Northern Irish designer, who showed his best selling invention, the crumpled-up Puzzle bag embellished with loads of sequins. Along with sturdier versions of his Shell bag, referencing the 19th-century ceramicist American George Ohr, better know as the Mad Potter of Biloxi. Google his image and you will understand. 
 
""Not bombastic but a sincere and embracing moment,"" concluded Anderson, after his most successful show in a box, or wall, to date. 
 
Arguably no designer in the Age of Instagram properly understands the desire of so many for clothes that make the wearer look as if they have just participated in a photo shoot. So, this highly photogenic collection should prove to be an immense success.

"Oct 2, 2020","Those wanting to behold a pure statement of fashion creation should do their best to catch online the latest collection by Yohji Yamamoto. Due to the pandemic there was actually only one proper runway show at Paris Fashion Week on Friday, but at least it was a great one.
 It was presented with great avant-garde élan on a dank night inside the giant gilded Salle des Fêtes of the French capital's City Hall, the perfect juxtaposition to an entirely black and white collection. 
 
Few people in fashion have ever draped as well as Yamamoto, who sculpted, wrapped and hung intricate shards of silk and fine wool around his angelic cast. Before going into a prolonged spasm of activity at the finale, using hangers and raw wire crinolines to make fabric practically explode off the models' torsos.The show comes at a moment when Yamamoto has rarely been busier – with rumors of multiple collaborations with such diverse brands as Hublot, Supreme and Lamborghini.
 
""The problem is maybe I have become too famous,"" deadpanned the sibylline designer.
 
Yamamoto likes to make his work speak for itself; like the perfectly judged coat-dresses cut with an effortless line that you could see the models adored wearing. Or the exotic indie screen goddess gowns that would turn heads anywhere on the planet. The technique throughout was audacious, with fabric in the shape of stunning cacti, jagged leaves or angry tentacles. At one stage he dreamed up a dry wool dress that looked from the front to be made up of a pair of gentleman’s pants, and from the back an elongated bolero. The intricate hairstyles, intersected with black cock feathers, in a fabulous performance by hairstylist Eugene Souleiman adding to the sense of exotic ritual. ""I am not an artist, maybe a kind of one. But when artists send political messages that is not very good. What I wanted was to be on the side of human beings, even if human beings are not always good,"" opined Yamamoto, whose protective style of swaddling women in swathes of fabric seems just right for our troubled times.
 
One had to enquire if this 76 year old ever hesitated about flying 11 hours from his headquarters in Tokyo this season to stage a collection in Paris?
 
""No, not really. Once I knew that there was going to be a season in Paris, I said 'let’s just do it!'""

"Oct 2, 2020","It was a season of socially distanced presentations in Paris. With scores of events on an appointments basis. Where designers personally presented their ideas to individual editors and buyers, a marked contrast with the usual, hurly burly of hustling into a dozen shows and launches every 24 hours.  
The effect was curiously old-fashioned but also liberating. A season almost purely for professionals and for once thankfully free of hoards of wannabe influencers. Where the very solitude of the pandemic made many designers hark back to their youth, and ideas that initially inspired them to go into fashion in the first place. 
 
FashionNetwork.com caught up with a slew of presentations to test the fashion pulse this season.Patou
Few harked back more than Guillaume Henry at the house of Patou, who showed plenty of playful volume and easy sophistication in a novel collection for the storied maison.
 
Presented inside Patou’s small headquarters on the Ile de la Cité, next door to where Commissaire Jules Maigret solved his toughest mysteries, Henry even created a private “screening room,” to decipher a quirky look book video of his spring-summer 2021 looks.
 
“I first dreamed of fashion as a young kid growing up in the countryside. And, during  the lockdown, I recalled the kid I was then, and my love of volume, fantasy and the sense of couture.  I am not a conceptual designer, I went back to my youth,” explained Henri, as he showed off his three-minute video.
 
Inspired by French TV reportages from the 90s shown late at night, which his parents recorded for him. Hence the video looked faintly scratchy like an old VHS recording. The result was a modular collection of considerable volume; puckered, ruched and ruffled bouffant skirts, dresses and blouses, with large Jacobean detachable collars. All anchored by his cool uber square mules and toped by Mary Janes, trèsfun, as the French like to say. No fusing, no thermo bonding, but a playful take on French femininity for today. 
  

Prune Goldschmidt
Prune Goldschmidt has a dream, to recreate the magic of her youth: of a young child dressing with her grandmother, before finding love and passion in her maturity.
 
Her clothes reflect that mix of innocence and naughtiness. From a Kamasutra print seen in flowing smock dresses to the naughty yet posh mini cocktails made of striped mannish shirt cottons.
 
“Yes, it’s a little twisted,” smiles Goldschmidt, who worked for Sonia and Nathalie Rykiel in her youth, before pausing to raise a family – she now has five children – and return with her own label in this debut collection. A cool video of the collection shot in a family chateau is called: Les Caprices.
 
Prune loves a statement collar, seen in some very natty seersucker trench coats and shirt dresses, or a charming denim combo of double breasted hacking jacket and bloomers. Everything finished with French skill, from the fabric buttons to the high quality fabrics; understandably as Goldschmidt’s grew up in the textile heart of northern France.
 
Prune Goldschmidt is presenting her debut collection and a series of statement piece costume jewelry until Oct. 5 at at 5 rue du Chevalier de Saint-George, Paris 8th.
  
Attire The Studio
Plenty of influencers have developed their own collections – from mini capsules to deals with H&M – but few will have put as much heart and soul into it as German social media hit Xenia Adonts.
 
Named Attire The Studio it’s a fully fledged attempt to create a truly sustainable fashion label, with the emphasis on transparency. When one scans its barcodes, Attire The Studio not only tells you the cost of the fabric, but also that of hardware, labor and transport. Allowing clients to directly compare Attire’s price compared to traditional retailing. Hard to get much more Direct to Consumer than that. They will even tell you the fabric mill, fiber origin and manufacturing location.  
 
Moreover, Attire uses two key fabric sources – organic cottons that are spun, woven and dyed in Italy, respecting the Global Organic Textile Standard, which limits toxic bleaches and chemical use.
 
“We wanted to make a collection that was truly sustainable, but affordable too,” said Xenia, who shows in her own apartment, in the new digital hipster domain of Paris located around the Bourse.
 
The clothes are very much classic with a twist, from mannish shirts with extended sleeves, cool cuffed pants suits; or lamb of mutton sleeved cable knits - dreamed up by executive designer Carmela Osorio Lugo.
 
Certain fashion editors still tend to look down their noses at influencers, allegedly for their lack of real fashion knowledge, but more often out of jealousy for their number of fans. Xenia, who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, has had the guts to try something genuinely new in fashion. Let’s respect her for that.Clara Daguin
The latest smart French designer to appear from California is Clara Daguin, who is staging a cerebral presentation within Joyce Gallery inside the Palais Royal. 
 
Daguin is showing just one style of jacket, albeit in a multiplicity of materials. Her curvilinear bomber jacket manages to be futurist yet contemporary. And comes in soft velour or brushed cotton, with interlocking illuminated LED trim. 
 
Though the star of the event is her Mad Scientist see-through Intergalactic Poet version, finished with built in golden chains and twinkling LEDs.  Located somewhere between her base in northern California in Cupertino and divinely demented couture, this mini show marks Daguin out as very much a name to follow.
 Octavio Pizarro
One could not fault the Chilean-born but Paris based designer Octavio Pizarro for the location of his presentation. Inside the splendid 7th arrondissement mansion that is the Chilean Embassy, once the home of Latin America’s greatest poet, Pablo Neruda. And there was something poetic about Pizarro’s collection, inspired from observing how his mother twisted shirts and jerseys into new shapes daily during the lockdown in Santiago. 
 
Sleeves shaped as bells, raglans, bishops, leg o mutton and puff in some great shirts and paired with cable knits and biker jackets.
 
One suspects that Signora Pizarro will love these ideas.  Hard to be more about returning to one’s origins than that.

"Oct 2, 2020","Now we know that the Paris Olympics are at least three years away, but we got a first inkling – a dancing acrobatic Disco vision even – of how they might look at Isabel Marant on Thursday night. 
This season, Marant collaborated with dance troupe (La)Horde, a spunky gymnastic dance corps, letting them rip in metallic sportswear gear on a wooden floor built inside the city’s uniquely beautiful apartment and garden complex, the 17th-century Palais Royal. 
 
It is probably the most famous square in the city, where the likes of Dennis Hopper, Bono, Jack Nicholson and multiple designers have been awarded the Légion d’honneur, where Danton plotted the French Revolution, where Colette penned her best works.Guests arriving in a mist of dry ice witnessed a handsome couple on roller blades, the guy lifting the lady into the air in front of the office of the Minister of Culture inside the garden.
 
Marant opened the show with the Horde running, summersaulting and back-flipping as the first models appeared in rose-silver cargo pants, pink micro minis worn with breastplate-tunic ensembles, and voluminous fencing shirts worn with her signature cowboy boots. When on a date they varied from micro, crotch-high flamenco cocktails to dusty pink gowns, worthy of Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story. Lots of lithe limbs on display.
 
Even the guys in this mixed collection wore lilac metallic second-skin leather shirts, red poet’s blouses and carpenters pants with their tops tied around the waist.
 
The Horde, however, worked their stuff in boxing shorts, gym tanks and stretch jogging pants – getting into lots of steamy routines. Before a finale where dancers marched up onto a forest of hands, before acting like they had fainted, almost ecstatically falling into the waiting arms.
 All of this earned a huge shout of approval when the designer took her bow. In a season where designers are grappling with how to respond to the pandemic, principally with clothing that underlines protection, it was good to see Marant emphasize physical wellbeing and the sheer joy of dance and sport.

""(La)Horde are a metaphor of a shifting world,"" said Marant, who received guests backstage wearing a plastic visor.

"Oct 1, 2020","Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz and a gang of Vogue and Elle editors showed up in Paris on Wednesday night – even if only virtually – at the latest Balmain show. 
Each of them appeared on their own flat screen, projecting them watching from the comfort of their own home or offices – from Beijing and Milan to London and New York. Allowing them, and several of their dogs, to witness Olivier Rousteing’s logo-drenched Spring/Summer 2021 collection for Balmain from the front row. 
 
It felt good to be back at this designer’s latest opus – staged with great gusto on a nippy fall evening inside the Jardin des Plantes, where last summer he held a mega show and late night concert. Guests gathered on two enormous bleachers with social distancing, with 50 noted editors, a handful of VIPs and the odd professional walker projected on their own flat-screens. During the show, some took calls, others texted, a few admired their own reflection, nobody yawned.
 
Principally because Rousteing delivered a powerful fashion statement, where every second look featured a dense archive logo print. Seen in pagoda-shoulder tuxedos, naughty dressing gowns and femme fatale cocktails for gals, or rock dandy blazers, lounge suits and award winning smoking jackets for dudes. 
 
Olivier is such a showman, he opened his own show walking the length of the 80-meter catwalk to pose on a nightclub singer’s bar stool as six veteran French models circled around him – all in logo outfits.
 
""All my career I’ve tried to maintain the prevalence of good taste, and of French elegance. And I believe that I hold the key to a French elegance, a measured and Cartesian elegance,"" explained founder Pierre Balmain in a vintage interview projected over loudspeakers, mixed up with Frank Sinatra’s My Way.
 
Rousteing’s own combination telegraphed the silhouette – an elongated blazer, with drop lapels, worn over flared pants in stretch. A style worn in various materials by boys and gals in his coed show. Followed by some dazzling day-glo sexpot cocktails, and brilliantly dazzling asymmetrical and barely-there mini cocktails. The models marching out from a wood of giant plane trees amid huge clouds of dry ice.  
""There is a touch of sex in fashion now,"" added Pierre, who never said a truer word, as the huge cast strutted to classic 80s rock anthems from Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode. 
 
""Balmain was founded in 1945 right after a terrible war, and we’re living through a war of a different kind today. And, maybe the response to that trauma is freedom, as Pierre Balmain suggested, and today freedom often means sexual freedom too,"" concluded Rousteing.
 
In a word, that’s what you call a real fashion show. And a statement and celebration of the whole métier.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 30, 2020","Designed in Lebanon; made in Lebanon; and shot and edited in Lebanon, yet Elie Saab’s newest collection and show video was still unveiled in Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.Entitled Hymn À la Vie, the 5-minute clip brilliantly captures the raw beauty of the Lebanese mountains - their massive raw rocks and parched high-altitude prairies, juxtaposed with the lush femininity of this spring-summer 2021 collection.
 
Shot in the hill northeast of Beirut, the cast strolled before giant granite boulders,  and endless mountain views, dotted with huge illuminated crosses.
 
“It’s a beautiful part of Lebanon, with amazing rock formations. Nature has a special flavour there. And, I loved the contrast with these clothes with the stark rocks,” explained Saab in a phone call from his studio in the Lebanese capital. His headquarters was damaged by the giant blast in Beirut in August, but builders managed to finish all the reparations work in 10 days.
 
For next spring, Elie mixes up beautiful white jumpsuits; elongated perforated cotton A-line dresses; or striking Arabesque chiffon gowns with dextrously sewn golden beading and trim. Often the marabou feathers that finished several looks stood out in the untamed nature, like a herd of black mountain goats that suddenly appeared over a ridge. 
Saab took his share of risks with fine white mannish shirts with bouffant sleeves; or delightful black crystal embroidered blouses with plisse armadillo sleeves.  A black negligee soirée section, with most looks accessorized with Phoenician gold costume jewelry, was totally chic.
 
A whole series of bright shamrock green pants suits; cutaway picnic dresses; and safari style cocktails all looked superb before the burned-out majestic ridges. All artfully filmed by Mounia Akl, with a great soundtrack by Ukrainian folk quartet DakhaBrakha. An award-winning filmmaker, Akl shot this summer’s special couture capsule collection that Saab prepared during lockdown. 
“I like the contrast between the lush green setting where Mounia shot couture, and this was raw, rocky location for my ready-to-wear. I wanted a celebration of the life and needed the strong, optimistic colors between white and black. I think after this very difficult year, people long to be happy again,” explained Elie.
 
All the cast finishing the day by striding to the mountain top, many in soft lilac fantasies, before a deep blue sunset and a half moon appeared.

Saab’s next destination is Milan to start working on his next collection and then to Paris, where this collection has just begun selling to buyers.

"Sep 30, 2020","One cannot fault Felipe Oliveira Baptista of lacking in energy and effort, especially in his second collection for the house of Kenzo, whose inspiration was that most industrious of all creatures, the bee. 
His imagination initially ignited by a dramatic organic photo of a wild beehive, the designer sent out a team of hipster bee-keepers in this spring summer collection, presented with wit and humor inside the rose garden of the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris in the 5th arrondissement.
 
A swarm of the insects were even spray-painted all over the street outside, and many more appeared inside a 36-page newspaper left on each garden stool. Its cover was a 100-year-old archive photo of a gardener in a huge mosquito head-net, posing with a clay pipe. And in case you didn’t get the message, the house even generously gave each guest a small jar of honey from the Sacré Coeur, as guests sat under huge expeditionary umbrellas in the light rain. 
Indeed, half the cast wore head-nets in this co-ed show, along with protective tunics and cloaks, in a season where security and sheltering have been the key themes to have emerged from this pandemic.
 
“After the ups and downs and fears during the lockdown I believe we are all thinking of protection.  But also being very optimistic to try to get out of this whole moment,” explained the designer in a noisy backstage.
 
After oddly somber debut show in February, it was vital Oliveira Baptista inject in bold colors, a central element of the Kenzo DNA. And he delivered with memorable digitally faded poppy-prints culled from the archives and used in dashing nylon parkas or great soft cotton suits for guys. 
Ikat style windcheaters; safari jackets with multiple industrial looking pockets for the gentleman farmers; or techy knit and lace cocktails with cut-outs and see-through slickers over Lycra jumpsuits for the hipster, nature loving gals.
 
The cast of 40 marching on high-tech geta sandals, with beautifully bizarre bubble soles, a neat riff on the brand’s Japanese origins. Plus, Oliveira Baptista worked his magic on some natty new double-bags, bucket shape leather bags that contained within them a second large nylon bag.
 
Playing on the theme of practical gardeners, he also whipped up some great new constructions – cool new jeans with added denim aprons and dandy fisherman’s waistcoats extended to the knee. What the designer called “adaptable fashion.” Ideal for a moment when the whole world has had to adapt.

"Sep 29, 2020","Ninja fashion from Marine Serre, in a wonderful video shot in giant clouds of mist and featuring many characters of indeterminate sex. 
Serre is often said to create post-apocalyptic fashion. This was more like mutant mode in a world where global warming has brutally run its course.
 
Not that anyone looked remotely bedraggled in this video, entitled ""Amor Fati"" and directed by Sacha Barbin and Ryan Doubiago, with a soundtrack from Pierre Rousseau. The cast starred Iranian-Dutch singer Sevdaliza and Marine’s buddy, the French artist Juliet Merie.Her survivalist chic concepts apparent in the potpourri of funky ethnic and punk jewelry, her cast eventually posed underneath a tree in a barren wasteland.
 
Serre’s signature moon lozenge print featured in jumpsuits throughout. At a climatic moment, a regiment encircled a heroine reborn and suspended above her crowd of followers. While her black-clad dystopian dandy warriors in tough-chic looks made of degradable nylon and recycled moiré marched to an operating theatre in this French version of THX 1138.
 
Another figure lying on the ground was suddenly engulfed by snakes, her pupils dilating in intense fear. Eventually a techy medieval gang takes over the action and gathers around their fallen heroine, laid out on a stone sarcophagus in streaming rain. Escaping a harness, our heroine walks in a giant survival harness crinoline to meet a Messianic monk. Whom she slowly undresses to reveal a human of indeterminate sex, a chameleonic figure.

Her collection transitioned fabrics too – whether regenerated carpets, or Marine’s classic regenerated denim updated through a laser engraving of the ""moonfish skin"" pattern. 
""This transition reflects a human being’s mobility in real life, where one has the power to change their style or mode of being, to transform or to blend in, building personal narratives through the garments that they choose to wear,"" explained Serre, who used her 2020 ANDAM Family Fund prize money to fund the film.

"Sep 29, 2020","Good to see Christelle Kocher back to doing what she does best – blending athletic sportswear with French street couture.
 Another of her great strengths, creating beguiling indie fashion shows on a small budget. Like she did at Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday evening, setting the scene inside the charming Buttes-Chaumont, a fantastic park in northeastern Paris, built with steep cliffs and charming follies.
 
Her cast was accompanied by a quartet of bagpipes in full belt, adding a grandeur to this collection, which felt like a celebration of life after the darkness of lockdown. The atmosphere was optimistic throughout even if  a steady drizzle meant many of the audience of 500 needed umbrellas.""Why am I doing a fashion show? Well… It’s a matter of resistance. It’s a matter of emotion. It’s about being alive, living in living bodies,"" argued Kocher in her green-hued program notes.
 
Nor did the rain detract from the energy of this collection, which opened with slip dresses made in football team stripes, denim negligee dresses, athletic bras and boxer shorts trimmed with lace and marvelous hoodie-cocktails done in paisley jacquard. 
 
In a coed Spring/Summer 2021 show, guys appeared in acid-dyed denim bowling shorts with matching shorts and sandals, floral-print jean jackets and Vietnam vet silk tops over track pants.
 
With uber models unable to fly in from New York – their main home – to Paris, there’s been a refreshing look to the casts this season. Nowhere more so than at Koché, with an excellent band of dashing young multi-ethnic Parisians, with all the cool hauteur, and innate style that implies. 
""An intimate show, close to nature, close to people, close to where I live and close to the dreams I had since I created Koché,"" added the designer.

With the Celtic quartet and drummer playing ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen, the cast marched with banners reading things like: ""Love Mother Nature Until She Comes"" or ""Parks Are Culture, Better Parks Better Culture."" And after the models posed on the banks of a curving pond, Christelle took an extended tour of the park’s main path to loud and warm applause, as the sound of bagpipes echoed throughout the 19th arrondissement.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 29, 2020","The weather gods were cruel Coperni this season, but the creative muses were far kinder, as this French duo staged an excellent collection on the rooftop of La Tour Montparnasse – the first live runway show of Paris Fashion Week . 
Normally this 59th floor offers stunning views of Paris, but on a dank Tuesday morning the weather closed in minutes before the show began; the vistas disappeared and the audience borrowed scores of umbrellas.
 
But if the atmosphere was suddenly gloomy, the collection was polished, punchy and protective.“In lockdown we were thinking all lot of the need to protect with masks, and hence of the idea of creating clothes that protected women. Fabrics that had strength and stretch. Lots of extensions that still let a woman move,” explained Sébastien Meyer, standing beside design partner Arnaud Vaillant post-show.
 
The idea for the collection came back in March when the duo developed a tutorial on how to develop your own mask to help fight the spread of the virus. Energizing fashion students, sewers, stylists and pattern makers to create masks at a moment when France faced a sever shortage of face masks.   
The Coperni spring-summer 2021 collection featured a total of 32 looks, opening with Edie Campbell. The English equestrian model appearing fittingly in an all-white ensemble of micro bomber jacket and stretch jodhpurs.
 
Sculpted cocktails, sleek architectural suits and great off the shoulder shirts were the key to this collection, a modern streamlined style that recalled hints of the duo’s earlier work at Courrèges.  Plenty of what they called 3D fabrics, like knitted stretch. And one stunning all turquoise ensemble – made of strap legging pants, zippered windcheater jacket and matching chador. Talk about a fantastic Olympic Games opening look. Not a band way to celebrate Cathy Freeman, the Aboriginal, Baha’i believer who always raced with her head covered, during so when she won the 400 meters’ gold 20 years ago this month in Sydney
 
The duo also sent out some great, clean accessories, notably super cool platform sandals, as this brand expands its range. All told, a great day of work from Coperni and for this cast, whose finale in the light rain to the soaring synthesizers of Dedekind Cut’s De-Civilization, had a heroic air.

"Sep 29, 2020","Valentino brought Milan Fashion Week to a close beautifully on Sunday. The brand, which returned to the Lombard capital after 13 years of runways in Paris, did not disappoint with its collection, which mixed romantic touches with a perfectly contemporary aesthetic, all while focusing on a concept of simplicity that felt particularly pertinent in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
  
In order to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, the Rome-based fashion house intensified its security measures and chose a gigantic venue for its show: the old hangar of the Macchi foundry, which welcomed guests with open doors into a space interspersed with islands of ferns and wildflowers. In the middle of this rough and dusty industrial environment, the brand set up a stage with a grand piano, which accompanied the vocals of London-born singer-songwriter Labrinth. 

It was therefore to an emotive soul melody punctuated by finger clicks that the diverse male and female models, picked via street casting and brought together for the first time at the show, appeared, suddenly bringing a breath of life into the location. It was a very precise way for creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli to redefine the codes of the house, developing its wardrobe towards a more simplified attitude and forms. The collection kicked off with a little black dress revised as a playsuit and continued with looks of the utmost simplicity: a series of essential tailored pieces in various shades of monochrome, but particularly in black and white. Then the aesthetic began to broaden subtly, bringing in other wardrobe classics, such as a white shirt, or a pair of five-pocket jeans, which were the result of a collaboration with Levi's and were paired with a diaphanous blouse in silk muslin, not to mention the shorts and blazers. Gradually looks began to be enriched by the introduction of colour, reimagined prints from the house's archives, and lace, which all had starring roles this season. Loose white shirts with bibs were elevated with guipure and worn with cycling shorts, or were drenched in colour, alternating mauve and candy pink, and slipped over mini-shorts. 

Large black cardigans were crocheted, as were some little 3D pieces, while jumpers were loosely knit and a macramé skirt took on the air of a net. Elsewhere, colourful appliqué flowers bloomed and spread across lace looks in black, white or nude. Maxi or ultra-shortSlowly the collection's register expanded through the introduction of giant flower prints on silk pieces in purple, green, yellow and red. These floral fabrics were used to make maxi-dresses, taking the form of capes and kaftans, but also to tailor shirts, shorts and even a sweatshirt. For the evening, the looks were an explosion of vibrant hues, seen in floating dresses with trains, executed in muslin or intangible chiffon. There was no need for other decorations or embellishments. Valentino's new woman shows what she's worth through her personality and desires, mixing and matching pieces as she likes. She dares to don lace couture for her day-to-day wear and a monochrome dress for the evening. 
 
The men on the runway were just as cool, and no less elegant, wearing loose suits, shirts and comfortable shorts. Just like their female alter egos, they opted for large jackets or lacy shirts worn over short shorts or a simple pair of jeans. 

There were no half measures in this collection for Spring/Summer 2021, which was focused around clothes to be lived in on a daily basis, while accessories were relegated to a secondary role. The only possible lengths were maxi or ultra-short. 

As explained by the brand in its programme notes: ""The result is a suggestion of what Valentino can be now, by following a new perspective. It's a reflection about the values which constitute an identity which is constantly evolving and not about the aesthetic that manifests it.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 29, 2020","Paris Fashion Week opened, with an entirely digital Monday, as a half dozen designers, many of them making their French debuts, kicked off the runway season here in the capital.
 Mame Kurogouchi
Japanese designer Mame (pronounced Mamé) Kurogouchi ignited the action on the calendar with a touching video of a single model captured through a window built within a translucent shoji wall in her hometown of Nagano.
 
Kurogouchi specializes in truly sensitive and feminine avant-garde fashion. This season that meant pleated skirts with see-through tops, visible bras, big hoop earrings and cloche hats all in matching soft white. Or statuesque Roman empress dresses made in caramel canvas and superb dentelle schoolmarm looks. The lone model then spray-painted the entire windowpane, bringing the action to a close.Wales Bonner
One of the most talented names to have emerged from British menswear in the past half decade is Grace Wales Bonner, whose work is about ennobling the experience of her ancestors from the Caribbean and Africa in a meeting of their cultural references with sophisticated Western tailoring.
 
There wasn’t a huge amount of fashion in this 5.25-minute clip, but what there was looked great – from the bravura assemblage of band leader tuxedo and baseball jacket to perfect revamps of jockey shirts and dandy knit bombers. All loosely inspired by that classic film, The Harder They Come, and all the better for that.
 
Entitled ""Thinkin Home,"" and directed by artist Jeano Edwards, this was a first-rate fashion clip and an earthy and honest expression of the Bonner aesthetic. All mixed up with some great looks from her collab, Adidas Originals for Wales Bonner, seen on the opening youth who marched a fine bay mare steed along an oceanic beach.
 
Shot in and around Fort Clarence Beach, Jamaica, and in the lush vegetation above the strand, this marked the latest step in Bonner’s ascent from talented novice to genuine star.
  
Kimhekim
Though based in Paris, and Korean born, this designer actually shot his show-reel video in London and then edited it in Seoul.
 
And though he is known as something of a conceptualist, this was a collection of tailored merchandise, and the video clip was a fun-loving moment in a Victorian Hall in Middle England.
 
Kiminte Kimhekim is a competent tailor, a decent draper and has a smart sense of proportion. The models clearly enjoyed the shoot and a lot of gals will appreciate his arty mesh dresses in exotic bird and large leaf prints, as well as his mega button 19th-century military apparel. But, we’re afraid, this was not exactly an earth-shattering fashion experience.
 
Situationist
Greetings from sunny Georgia, where Situationist shot its online contribution in streets, markets and thrift shops, before a bemused assemblage of civilians. Featuring deep lilac satin pantsuits for gals and sinful red rock-poet suits for guys from Situationist designer Irakli Rusadze’s sixth appearance in Paris.
 
Cut with retro futurist chutzpah, attention seeking darts, 45-degree hemlines and quirky lapels and collars, this was certainly an inventive display of fashion by the most off-beat talent from the Black Sea to have made it all the way to Paris. Think Mary Quant meets Thom Browne.

Pelle the Conqueror terrain – and why not? – to display the modern romanticism of Danish hopeful  
Cecilie Bahnsen. Giant dunes, remote beachside grass and lots of wind as the cast stomp across an unforgiving landscape.
 
Before suddenly making it into a giant urban studio, once again in Bahnsen Scandi-chic style, where everyone wants to look like a gallery owner, but comes across as a gallerina. Even if they are marching before a bluesy Baltic seascape at sunset in a video for some reason named ""The Summit.""
 
S.R. Studio. LA. CA.
S.R. Studio. LA. CA. is the fashion label of cult artist Sterling Ruby, whose friendship wit Raf Simons led him to found his own fashion business. 
 
""No sovereignty. No empathy... Tread on me... Soak me in bleach and blood… End the tyranny of the president’s grand dragon,"" intoned two narrators in the video presentation by the brand.
 
One solitary figure hunkered down in a courtyard, or prison yard, who rises to still hide behind a single sheet of denim canvas. 
 
Made in support of the ACLU, this was a meditation on Black Lives Matter, and a splendidly lit video, even if the political point was a tad obscure. Not much fashion but at least a stand for justice.

"Sep 28, 2020","One cannot fault Dunhill’s designer Mark Weston for lack of ambition. He paired several very disparate cultures and concepts in his latest show for the house – from Japanese 90s design to British tailoring to inside out fabrication – but the net result was one of the most interesting menswear collections seen anywhere this year.Weston kept the presentation simple, lots of dashing young men walking briskly in a mock runway setting, before no audience in his online display Monday early afternoon. And, from the get-go, Weston’s meeting of these two great island cultures clearly jelled . Soft, kimono shaped shoulders and avant-garde Japanese draping meeting all sort of classical UK tailoring touches – from enlarged stitching to basting.
 
“It’s about taking our key elements – tailoring and leather and strong other materials. While I also wanted to be about structure and substance, along with the joy of working by hand,” explained Weston in a pre-show zoom interview. 
All told, there was a sense of menswear couture – haute game fabrics use experimentally. Collar canvas; linen canvas or linen holland, a material normally used within a jacket to strengthen it and secure the pockets. Except when Weston got his hands on the material he cut it into a pair of great strap pants .Riffing on the idea of elements from within taken outside to make a jacket, and then letting his staff go to work on multiple examples of hand stitching and basting with  bomber jackets in linen wool canvas. Everything cut to envelope the torso, but lightly to suggest great ease and self-assurance. Mostly finished with light industry hardware, buckles, clasps and clips. And for a lighter mood, Nippon Punk graphic party shirts. From fluid cape bomber looks to a fantastic reinvented archive duster in a soft buttery hue with box stitching and external seaming this was a collection of great poise.
 
Back in 1902 the two countries signed the Anglo Japanese Alliance. If they ever decided to celebrate that wise pact, this is the collection they should wear to the party.

"Sep 28, 2020","Even before it has opened to the public, LVMH is going to let Louis Vuitton use the new super luxe location of La Samaritaine as the setting for the brand’s next show.Vuitton will unveil its spring summer at 3PM on Tuesday, October 6 inside La Samaritaine, a famed department store on the banks of the Seine that has been closed for renovation for over a decade and a half.

The show event be the last physical show in Paris Fashion Week, which debuts this Monday afternoon with nine-days of shows and over 80 events on the calendar.A spokesman for Vuitton confirmed that the next show by the house’s critically acclaimed women’s designer Nicholas Ghesquière will take place at Samaritaine, which includes a new 5-star luxury hotel, Le Cheval Blanc with exceptional views over Pont Neuf.

The designer will send out his cast on the top floor of the complex, underneath a giant glass dome, which casts light into a massive interior atrium. Due to social distancing, Vuitton will stage two shows, with about 200 guests per show.

In recent seasons, Ghesquière has staged many of the shows nearby at the Louvre Museum. However, this will be an even easier journey to bring the collection. Vuitton’s world headquarters is located on the other side of the street from La Samaritaine.

This luxury construction company – encompassing an uber-chic department store, luxury hotel, hi-tech office space and even public housing – has been in the pipeline for over 15 years at a budget of €750 million. It was due to open in April, but was pushed back to early 2021 due to the pandemic.

The project includes the relaunched Samaritaine 20,000 square-meter department store and the latest edition of haute gamme hotel Cheval Blanc, 72 rooms all overlooking the Seine with a starting price of €1,500 per night, dreamed up by architect Peter Marino. Besides over a dozen restaurants – several designed to win Michelin stars – shared between store and hotel, there are a further 96 public housing apartments.   LVMH acquired La Samaritaine back in 2001, a storied department store first built in 1870 by the Cognacq-Jay family. Three years after the acquisition, LVMH closed the whole structure, citing major asbestos and structural problems in the main building. This began a convoluted series of proposals and negotiations with City Hall in Paris, which only really culminated in 2015, when proper construction began.

“Ernest Cognacq and Louise Jay, who donated the motto 'in constant progress' to their store and their foundation, set the direction. I think I can say today that we have, with tenacity, respected their wish and that the La Samaritaine of tomorrow will be more beautiful than ever, re-finding its place at the center of Paris,” said LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault.

The project will also confirm LVMH’s ambitions as a high-end innkeeper. The new Cheval Blanc joins a luxe ski hotel in Courchevel, a tony hotel in St Tropez, and an elegiac resort in the Maldives. Moreover, it also joins LVMH’s burgeoning new division, LVMH Hotellerie, whose key element is the Belmond Group, acquired this spring, which includes such stellar names as the Copacabana Palace, Rio; the Splendido in Portofino and the Sanctuary Lodge in Machu Picchu.

"Sep 28, 2020","Gucci North America and the Council of Fashion Designers of America have opened applications for the 2020-2021 Gucci Changemakers x CFDA Scholars by Design Award.Launched as part of Gucci North America’s Changemakers program - -a series of diversity initiatives Gucci said has existed internally since 2018, but which was pushed to the forefront after the brand faced backlash over creating a ""blackface sweater"" -- the design award will be dedicated to ""a woman of color or a person who identifies as a woman entering her senior year of design school,"" the brand said. 

The winner will be awarded with a $20,000 scholarship, as well as mentorship, and will be judged based on talent, financial need and professional potential. “The Gucci North America x CFDA Scholars by Design award is the foundation to developing and empowering future female leaders of color in fashion, so that their particularly vital contributions and voices can resonate, inspire, and transform the consciousness of the industry towards equitable representation at all levels,” said CaSandra Diggs, president of the CFDA. 

“We are very pleased to continue the partnership with Gucci Changemakers and Gucci North America, which will further the CFDA’s important work to create a fashion industry that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive.”

The Gucci Changemakers x CFDA Scholars by Design Award first premiered last year, and was then dedicated to two high school graduates pursuing a higher education in the field of fashion design.

Applications are also open for the Changemakers' Impact Fund, which awards grant funding to nonprofit organizations, and the Scholars Award, another scholarship opportunity for high school seniors and currently enrolled undergraduate students attending an accredited two-year community college or four-year college or university, awarded based on financial need. 

Gucci has invested over $2 million in the Changemakers program since 2019.

For this year's launch video, Gucci has partnered with filmmakers Satchel Lee, Spike Lee’s daughter, and Chance Chamblin, June Ambrose’s son.

“Our vision for the Changemakers launch video underscores the premise that change does not happen in a vacuum,"" the two filmmakers said. 

""Even when the seed might be planted by an individual – meaningful progress only occurs when we come together as a community bound by our collective humanity. We need each other.""

"Sep 27, 2020","All about cultural and conceptual diversity in Milan on its final Sunday afternoon, at three very contrasting shows, albeit by two brands two with similar names – MSGM and MM6 – and a third with uber wide-ranging origins.
 MSGM

If any designer gets today’s Italy it is Massimo Giorgetti, founder of MSGM, whose snappy four-minute online video captured how multi-cultural and multi-ethnic his country has become.Entitled ""Autoritratto: Self-portrait of a Generation,"" it featured a gang of young Milan-based models, many of non-Italian origin, most of them speaking the language fluently. 
 
Sitting in a studio with monitors featuring their looks posed at odd angles, they responded to questions, like: ""Pronounce your name? What does it mean?""
 
""Martina, meaning daughter of the god of war,"" smiled one teenager. Another, explained simply: ""Mi chiamo Zoe,"" or ""I’m called Zoe.""
 
A cerebral beauty – a human evolutionary scientist – explained her name was ""a really interesting one. It’s a Mexican flower named by a German scientist – Zinnia."" Next an alluring  Italo-Chinese lady revealed, in Italian, that her Italian name was  Angela, while in Chinese she is called Qu-iao-Yi. 
 
They also discussed the funniest memory from their childhood, or what part of themselves they liked most. Whereupon a young lady with a marvelous dreadlock mane named Naomi Oke explained in Italian that she was the only kid of color in her school, and that she wanted to fit in like a princess who had her hair brushed: ""And then the nightmare began. I had lots of perms, I tried to smooth it, to look more like my friends, but growing up I came to love it, and now it’s the part of me I prefer."" 
 
The clothes, like the cast, blended origins and ideas with similar insouciance. Lime-hued Catherine de' Medici ruffles topped great parkas; sleeveless safari looks met Chanel tweed jackets, finished with matching shorts and combat boots; abstract floral mini frocks came with huge flamenco sleeves; while Ibiza summer clubbing shirts and pants were dipped into turquoise and yellow tie-dye.
 
After six months of lockdown, this explosion of color and wit from MSGM felt like a trumpet call of joy.
 MM6

This marked the debut of an MM6 Maison Margiela collection in Italy, despite the fact that the Paris-based house was acquired back in 2002 by one of the peninsula’s most dynamic fashion players, Renzo Rosso of Diesel fame.
 
A conceptual casting and look-book shoot for a conceptual house in what looked like a classic disused factory in Lombardy, but might well have been Paris. It featured a series of models, initially standing before a simple white wall, before the movie gradually revealed the surrounding staff preparing the shoot.
 
They, but of course, all wore the signature laboratory coats that are de rigueur for staff at this house. When the wall changed to beige so did the looks. Gradually a DJ set up for action, with a large speaker, all in hand-painted white. The turntable read 6.
 
Lots of clever plays on classic Margiela, from painted cloven-toed boots and reimagined denim minis to taut flesh-hued tops, bravura prints, opera gloves with micro lettering, and Verner Panton graphic ensembles seen in Verner Panton lighting.
 
Pre-show, the house showed the preparation of a metal invitation to the show. While the video’s set eventually added chairs and all the usual white spray-painted objects one associates with a Margiela store – books, boxes, tables, chairs and bric-a-brac.
 
At the finale, a dude in a biker jacket took a mystery phone call, without any actual mobile phone, as the credits ran. Not terribly clear why they ""moved"" MM6, which usually shows in London, onto the Milan calendar this season. But one thing is clear, this house’s DNA is still so strong it can expect a great future.
 Ji Won Choi

New York and Korea met in Milan at Ji Won Choi. Though it was a version of the city that most fashionistas would not be familiar with. Modern New York silhouettes were brought together with Korean architectural shapes in a tour of the Italian fashion capital – shot at Roman walls, pinball cafés, posh hippie gardens, railway underpasses, tramlines and the new high-tech skyscrapers of the city.
 
Before this scenario the cast appeared in over-the-top checkerboard looks – bright blue suits for the boys, blood orange cloaks for the girls. Or jumpsuits in sustainably produced fabrics seemingly held together with straps plastered with price tags and bar codes. Nothing terribly revolutionary maybe but crammed with energy and attitude in a memorable display by this Seoul-born, Midwest-raised and Paris and NYC-trained talent.
 
Ji Won Choi has arrived online – just like Milan Fashion Week.

"Sep 27, 2020","Few designers have had as remarkable a career as Giorgio Armani, and his unique fashion history was the subject of a hagiographic video that preceded the presentation of the latest collection by Italy’s most famous living designer, shown online on Saturday night. No one could even accuse Armani of being blemished by the crime of false modesty.
 Giorgio Armani entirely avoided any live catwalk show this Milan Fashion Week, but he did stage this close-door show of his signature collection on Saturday night on the internet. And preceded it with the 15-minute mini-bio of his design and brand entitled ""Timeless Thoughts.""
 
Narrated by Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino, it was a greatest hits of Giorgio’s most special moments: From Armani as a draper and tailor inside his lush studio, to interviews where he expounds his design philosophy to a multitude of big names.""I wanted to evolve my woman and not betray her,"" opined Armani, speaking with his movie star looks of 40 years ago.
 
There were scores of magazine covers of Giorgio, and even a HSBC ad; twice as many images of movie stars in his clothes; as well as Isabelle Huppert, Juliette Binoche, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and the mayor of Milan providing elegies. 
 
""He started his revolution with the suit jacket, deconstructed it and made it like a second skin…  avoiding any cross dressing effect,"" argued Favino legitimately. 
""The fabrics are always soft, the colors are always neutral… ever since 1975, when supported by his only partner Sergio Galeotti, he decided to dress real people,"" intoned the actor's velvety voice.
 
All the way to ""One Night Only"" and his support of Bono’s Red movement, Armani’s multiple hotel openings and the global impact of American Gigolo, when dressing Richard Gere led to dressing the Gotha of Hollywood.
 
After that, the collection felt a tad like an afterthought. Happily, it was a perfectly respectable display, especially its menswear, even if all told it was not quite a vintage season.
 
Set against a putty gray wall, Armani sent out pure, fluid looks for ladies – from feather-light deconstructed jackets and lapel-free boleros to languid dhotis in abstract prints and some wonderful Asian-influence floral-print dresses. All with the majestic fluidity one expects from Armani.
 
Plus, his unshaven, smart seducer guys were a reminder of why so many men will always love Armani’s tailoring – he makes them look like sexy assassins.
 
Sleekly slouchy double-breasted jackets, dandy chauffeur tunics and flawless double-breasted silk waistcoats, all in wonderful light yet stiff fabrics for the boys. The entire cast walked on a metallic catwalk before giant vistas of deserts and mountains but, once again, in non-specific hues and shades. 
This ready-to-wear collection fit the cast so well, they looked like couture clothes measured and fitted individually. A timely reminder that while his aesthetic may have stayed a little trapped in the aspic of the 80s and 90s, Armani’s tailoring remains the best of any living designer. Not bad for a man of 86.
 
Reacting to the bio and video, some fans even began posting the opening credits of American Gigolo on social media – Richard Gere driving down the Pacific Highway in his Mercedes 350 after an assignation with a rich lady client.

"Sep 26, 2020","Marni went on fashion’s biggest long-distance video adventure this season, with a live online show on Friday afternoon that rambled around eight cities and four continents.Named Marnifesto, it consisted of sixteen mini-screen Zoom-style videos shot with handheld cameras, mobiles and stationary positions. From the banks of the Lake St Clair in Detroit to parks in London; from downtown New York lofts to back streets in Dakar, all the way to suburban train stations near Milan.
 
Masked youths in menswear clambered up ramps in London parks, dressed like some County Lines gang, in oversized hoodies with giant paint-splattered lettering. What one could glimpse looked very clever – like the patchwork wrap coat cut in vertical shards seen on a raven-haired lass getting a lift in a mini-auto in Milan.  There were also glimpses and snatches of cheesecloth or toile stapled together in instinctive and raw shapes. Plus, multiple leather coats embossed with poetry, or jackets where printed words became like camouflage or flowers.
 
Since September 11, Marni began sending the 48 looks out to models, artists and friends to wear in this ""show,"" fitting them online, but largely letting the cast choose their own setting and mood.
 
The only trouble was that it was petty darned hard to see many actual clothes, the images were small and the angles so obtuse. One had a better vision of the owner’s cats or a wee terrier than the clobber. And one heard a lot of wind noise too.
 
Marni’s designer Francesco Risso and partner Lawrence Steel spent the lockdown working in their apartment near Parco Sempione in Milan. 
 
""It was great in beginning but after a few weeks really oppressive. This feeling of a being in deserted city. That energy was drowning us in negativity,"" conceded Risso, in a pre-show Zoom with FashioNetwork.com.
 
As a result, instinctively his feelings and emotions grew more in the direction of Marni’s DNA, which is tactile, sensorial and emotional. And, in their separate spaces in confinement his team began making things from curtains and dyeing material in bathtubs. That and writing love letters to each other and to artists that collaborate with Marni.

""So when we went back to office and were all together there was so much energy and skills to share and that was really beautiful,"" he recalls of the reunion in May.
 
""This collection is almost hard to talk about in terms of clothes. It’s not about making a statement, more a story of people and dialogue,"" he stressed. 
In the end, the conversations overtook the clothes. What was left were touching speeches by multiple young artists but little real insight into fashion. Impossible to appreciate on a phone, no wonder Risso watched it on a big screen in a cinema with his team.
 
When he is in the creative zone, Francesco Risso is one of the half-dozen most original designers operating in fashion today. It was just that this Marnifesto left viewers with little evidence of that fact.
 
""This will evolve during the live show, as we really don’t know what the fuck is going happen. I wanted gathered narratives to express the multifaceted canvas that is Marni,"" said Risso, who certainly produced the narratives but maybe not that much of a fashion canvas.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2020","Few new brands are quite so out there in Milan these days as GCDS, a reverse immigrant story, that staged what it termed an “electronic bonanza,” to round off Thursday night’s action in Milan Fashion Week. 
GCDS is the brainchild of two brothers - Giuliano and Giordano Calza - who were born in Naples, but founded their fashion house in Milan. However, their first steps into la mode began not in Italy but in Shanghai, when they were running five restaurants and thirsting for another moment to begin in their lives.
 
That unexpected path is reflected in the designs of GCDS; whose name stands for God Can't Destroy Streetwear. And to many, the Almighty has certainly ripped up many conventional habits this year in the pandemic, like typical notions about staging fashion collections, as designers worldwide have scrambled to reinvent shows and presentations post-lockdown. Few more so than Giuliano Calza, who hired LA engineering firm Emblematic Group to mash up wacky characters, Day-Glo kitsch and various video dreams for GCDS’s latest presentation. 
 
Transforming a show into a virtual, unexplored planet, with the help of the Los Angeles, California-based engineering firm Emblematic Group and their REACH.Love platform, pulling together a one-off team of  creative hacker and artist Thomas Webb, and director Jeron Braxton, who lensed The Weeknd’s “In Your Eyes” video.

In Milan, the brothers will unveil the concept Thursday night at 8 p.m. to their  design and PR team in the garden of their Porta Venezia office. In LA, there will be a simultaneously live display.
 
So we caught up with designer Giuliano Calza, who studied political science in Naples, and his CEO brother Giordano, who has a bachelor’s in economics from Bocconi business school in Milan, on a Zoom call. Giuliano, attired in a skull print sweatshirt, and Giordano, in a denim shirt, giving their take on what’s next for fashion and GCDS. 
FashionNetwork.com: Why did you decide to create a digital arcade?
Giuliano Calza: I was working in my house looking out the windows and thinking how can I escape this prison. I wanted something to cheer up people and create something that excited them, so I decided to take everyone out of this world. I thought, ‘That’s a pleasant place and that's exactly what I find.’ 3D-generated and designed so that the clothes will flow and looked exactly like in reality. Everyone wants to be part of the audience at a fashion show and this year we can sit them wherever we want, anywhere, even near celebrities. It’s a democratic choice. But the project was extremely exhausting. But I am really excited to create like this Blade Runner kind of feeling. In this world, you can change the weather and atmosphere around; or people can enjoy games and even go backstage. We will have lots of games – new version of Pacman and pinball and everything you had on your first computer.
 
FNW: Why did you pick the tagline - God Can't Destroy Streetwear?
Giuliano: It was a teenage decision. I started this project aged just 20. I am always cheerful and up for some fun and I that felt fashion needed that. I felt, ‘why does everyone have to wear black?’ Let’s do it in pink and green. I always had an idea that clothing is a camouflage that reflects our mood.
 
FNW: Define the DNA of GCDS?
Giuliano: It’s a quirky playful style made in Italy. Streetwear that is produced in the best factories of Italy, with excellent knitwear and sartorial cuts. It’s beauty that is modern and manga.

FNW: Would you call yourself a skateboarder label?
Giuliano: No, because today the kind items we create are hand-made and highly artisanal and we have coats from the same factory used by Gucci and Dolce. We are between streetwear and fashion.
 
FNW: You once did a show in New York? Why did you come back to Italy?
Giuliano: Yes, we did once for Spring-Summer 2017. In fact, New York Fashion Week invited me as Italian Most Loved and they paid everything, and we did a hit show on a pier. But New York is three times as expensive as Milano! So, not again.
 
FNW: What sort of year are you having, Giordano?
Giordano: We just opened in London but only stayed open for three weeks. And we opened a fifth store in Asia in Shanghai. This year we didn’t fire anyone due to Covid. We haven’t done that. Every kid is still working for us. 
FNW: What is your annual turnover?
Giordano: 20 million euros, about 80% wholesale. In 2020, it will probably be the same as last year, maybe plus 5%.
 
FNW: How many sales points do you have?
Giuliano: We have seven stores of our own, and then about 370 sales points, not many department stores – my brother doesn’t like them. Essentially boutiques. We see it as entry-level luxury.
 
Giordano: Our online sales have more or less doubled this year. But we had to close our showroom in Paris, and no one can come to the showroom in Milan, so everything is done by Zoom. But right now, we don’t have many negative signs. Our budget is at least the same as last year thanks to e-commerce. Plus, we are going to open a store in Rome, on Via del Babuino. Our own direct store. We got the landlord to accept a percentage of sales. So, No Key Money! Landlords like our brand because you cannot define clearly what our brand is. We can sell pasta or water or anything!
 
Giuliano: We directly produce beauty. I chose each item, and everything is fun. Like our lipstick named Marijuana, that works and sells a lot. But beauty needs a large investment, so we go slowly.
 
FNW: What is your biggest market?
Giordano: China is our second market after Italy, including stores in Shanghai, Beijing and since a week in Hong Kong.
 
Giuliano: I used to live in Shanghai. I opened an Italian restaurant, and at some point, we had five, but I found it all very stressful managing food and people. Lots of screaming, so we wanted a change. Anyway, I was kicked out as I didn’t have a visa so, strangely, going there feels like going back home. You see I made my first hoodies in China and took them back to sell in Milan. So ours is a real immigrant story!

"Sep 25, 2020","Tomorrow Ltd, the London-based brand consultancy, has announced a major new link-up with Colville, the two-year-old brand founded by former Marni design director Molly Molloy and ex-British Vogue fashion director Lucinda Chambers.Their Milan-based label, which produces ready-to-wear, accessories and homewares, has received a “significant” equity investment from Tomorrow, which will now act as its Global Licensing partner.

Colville is an interesting label as it’s more than just a brand launched by two creatives. It’s as much a collective of designers who work with a network of regular collaborators and project partners, a fact that was obviously appealing to Tomorrow.The company said the two will be working together across all areas of the Tomorrow Platform – from sales and distribution, marketing and content production, manufacturing, and retail, as well as providing overall support on strategy, operations, and delivery. Tomorrow Consulting will also work closely with Colville to advise on collabs and additional future partnerships.  

Colville was founded in 2018 as “a unique collective of the two distinct personal points of view, as well as their wide circle of collaborators, who come together with a synergy and a shared passion”.

Tomorrow’s co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer Giancarlo Simiri said that the brand “has real substance that comes from the combination of the distinctive characters involved. They have a unique ability to create product that comes straight from their heart and soul. At our first meeting, I had that instant punch-in-the-gut feeling, and we are very proud to be working together.”

And Tomorrow CEO Stefano Martinetto added that Molloy and Chambers “are passionate about working with a strong sense of responsibility in the industry and across all that they do – the partners they work with, the materials used in the collections, and the way they behave as a brand. There was immediately a feeling of a mirroring of spirit between Colville and Tomorrow. Colville’s creativity, energy, and passion are aligned with Tomorrow’s mission to support and champion entrepreneurial creativity.” 

Tomorrow Ltd is a multi-service business development platform for fashion brands that helps those brands “to develop and achieve sustainable growth through a fully integrated service offering”. It was founded in 2008 and as well as its HQ in London, it has offices and showrooms in Milan, Paris, New York and Hong Kong. 

Led by Martinetto and Simiri, back in May it announced a “360-degree” partnership with Italian ready-to-wear brand No21 and last year celebrity US fashion consultant Julie Gilhart merged her company with it. Tomorrow also backed French label Coperni’s relaunch in 2019 and other labels it works with include A-Cold-Wall, Ader Error, Ambush, Facetasm, and Sunnei.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2020","The National Retail Federation Foundation has announced its latest round of Next Generation scholarship finalists. This year's final five finalists are Sophia Van Slyke from Butler University; Amaiya Sims from Columbia College Chicago; Eugene Choi from Santa Clara University; Madeline Wong from Santa Clara University; and Rachel Bennett from the Savannah College of Art and Design.

Launched in 2014 and sponsored by SAS, the scholarship gives monetary awards to students pursuing careers in retail. The top prize winner will be awarded with $25,000, while each of the other four finalists will receive $10,000. Narrowed from an original pool of nearly 100 applicants from 44 NRF University Member Schools, the scholarship awarded 25 students with $1,000 each in its first round. These students were then challenged to complete a case study created in collaboration with PetSmart, Inc. After being evaluated by a team of judges from PetSmart and a dozen other retail companies, the pool of 25 was narrowed to 10 students, who then participated in a virtual interview process with NRF staff and were taken down to the final five. 

“SAS congratulates the five finalists and celebrates the success of all the students who participated in the competition,” said SAS Vice President of Consumer and Communications and NRF Foundation board member, James Vickers. “We look forward to encouraging their curiosity and creativity in retail and bringing fresh ideas to the business problems challenging our industry now and in the future.” 

The scholarship's top recipient will be chosen after a final round of interviews with the NRF Foundation's board of directors, chaired by Macy’s Inc. Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette, and will be announced during the NRF’s virtual 'Big Show Chapter 1' in January of the new year.

"Sep 25, 2020","It was in the arcade of Brera Academy's courtyard that Max Mara decide to unveil its collection for Spring/Summer 2021 in Milan on Thursday. Here the brand presented an elegantly minimalist collection offering a series of new propositions in terms of cut and volume. There wasn't a fussy decoration or a showy colour in sight, as although creative director Ian Griffiths took his inspiration from the Italian Renaissance this season, it was only certain details and forms from the period that he channelled. Notably, he concentrated on the sleeves, which alternated between flared kimono or pagoda affairs and puffed sleeves that almost seemed to bubble thanks to playful use of pleating. Coats, trenches, shirts, tops, jackets and even jumpers were given long flaring sleeves which were slit up the inner arm to lend the pieces a cape-like look that facilitated movement. 
 
The classic parka, with its hood, snap fasteners, drawstrings and multiple functional pockets, was also revisited, appearing throughout the collection reimagined as a long jacket, a short coat or a little parachute dress. It could even be seen repurposed as a flight suit with bare shoulders and elasticated ankles. The waterproof fabric and drawstrings allowed the designer to play with different volumes, adding pleats at the wrists, the waist or even the décolletage of certain collars. Elements of the parka were also brought into some cotton dresses with pleated collars, as well as both mini and maxi skirts with side slits and maxi pockets. 
  
Aside from a few damask or jacquard inserts that appeared on the backs of some knit pieces, all of the silhouettes on display were rigorously monochrome, channelling a natural palette of beige, sienna, ochre and putty, with flashes of petrol blue and sage green. 

Next summer's Max Mara woman is naturally elegant, opting for a comfortable wardrobe characterised by ample volumes. Her jackets and suits are long, her trousers oversized, while her skirts fall straight to the knee. She wears no accessories, except perhaps a handbag or a mini-pouch, hanging from a rope worn around her neck.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 25, 2020","Raf Simons made his collaborative debut at Prada on Thursday afternoon, in the most keenly anticipated runway show in the world this year.Due to the pandemic, the collection was presented purely online, though selected guests were invited to view a post-show discussion with Simons and his new design partner Miuccia Prada, whose family own 90% of the publically quoted house.
 
Simons arrival certainly injected lots of new ideas into the Prada collection – from cast to clothing; from attitude to silhouette. And curiously, regarding the latter, an echo of the New Wave of Christian Dior, the house where Simons was creative director in the first half of the previous decade.Prada generously invited a select crew of editors and clients to a series of simultaneous projections of the collection in a half dozen cities – Shanghai, Tokyo, Dubai, Istanbul, Moscow, Berlin and Paris. And, in Paris, the appearance of the New Look silhouette caused a knowing murmur among several tables at the Prada lunch in the stylish La Girafe restaurant overlooking the Eiffel Tower.
 
Though, to be clear, it was a very cool and clever take on Dior’s silhouette – composed of clinging mohair knit sweaters over techy tops, with cut-outs and mini neckline logos on top of some marvelously flared mid-calf skirts, cinched with the famous wasp waist by nylon straps and seatbelt buckles. Often worn over a somewhat familiar French escarpin, sculpted mini heel.
 
A new casting too, recalling Raf’s penchant for very slim, innocent teenage models, in contrast to the set – a windowless studio all done in golden yellow drapes and matching carpet, with a sense of David Lynch mischief.
 
Dangling from the ceiling were a series of cameras, offering scores of viewing angles of the collection, where, one model at a time, the cast marched somberly, some names printed on hanging monitors.
 
The duo clearly had worked in harmony – and took their share of risks. Like adding multiple texts on satin, silk and nylon looks, often in French – like Signaux volent vers nous – which the Italians always regard as a sign of sophistication. 
  
Raf clearly loves the classic triangular Prada metallic logo, placing it on the neckline of the first five or six looks. And this new duo does appreciate a femme fatale, swaddling a half-dozen gals in the most beautiful element in the show: swirling, over-sized cocoon coats in mixes of mercerized cotton or moiré, often with contrasting exterior buttons.
 
They also cut upside-down backpacks into mini nylon skirts and played with the house’s signature retro Verner Panton stool, incorporating check board prints in several coats, which looked a tad gimmicky. All told, a powerful collection, though perhaps not a powerful statement, as if the whole shebang was not quite greater than the sum of its parts.
 
Post show, the pair sat on two benches four meters apart and fielded a series of softball questions printed on a giant screen behind them. Like, ""when did you first think of working together?""
 
""It never occurred to me this could happen but I’m glad it did. We met many years ago when Miuccia and Patrizio Bertelli gave me the position at Jil Sander and, thanks to that, my introduction to womenswear. So when the question came up this time, there was no doubt in my mind,"" responded Simons.
  
""Is everything in fashion regenerated?"" wondered another fan.
 
""Since Covid, everyone has to express the deep thoughts of their brand. So 'new' sounds like an important word,"" said Miuccia.

""Fashion always hopes for the new, everybody wants to be new. But when you have a brand for a few decades what’s important is to refresh your own body of work,"" added Raf.
 
One query read: ""What do you drink in the morning to start your day?"" Literally. We will not burden the reader with the designers' responses.""How did Raf view the Prada company before arriving?""

“For many many years, even before I started my own brand 25 years ago, I had already seen it as very community. That it has a very secret attitude, intellect and aesthetic. You cannot really define what it is but it exists and is clearly present,"" responded the Belgian designer, dressed in an oversized cable wool sweater and black pants.
 
And, ""how does one become a designer?"" asked a youthful fan.
 
""Study, study, study; watch movies; look at art and read literature. The result of my clothes is that the people who wear them feel a little better, so they are useful. So really think about them as an instrument for your life,"" concluded Miuccia, dressed in a flared and pleated white skirt and dark blue sweater.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 24, 2020","The Milan Fashion Week, which opened on Tuesday under grey skies, is scheduled to end on Monday September 28, handing the baton over to Paris. Like the unsettled Milanese weather, clear skies alternating with showers, the programme for this fashion week dedicated to the Spring/Summer 2021 womenswear (and in some cases menswear) collections has been changeable until the last minute. For obvious reasons, this can't be expected to be a normal fashion week.
 The event's customary frenetic pace is a distant memory. The atmosphere at the Italian Fashion Chamber’s Fashion Hub, the section focusing on emerging designers that opened on Tuesday night, was almost surreal. There was no hustle and bustle at the entrance like in February, only a few scattered guests slipping swiftly through the check-point where their temperature was read. At reception, each guest duly filled in a form providing their contact information, receiving in exchange a face mask in bio-tech material produced by Italian manufacturer U-mask.
 
“This Fashion Week must be an example of our ability to adapt and live with Covid-19 in the smartest possible way. In the course of the week, we want to demonstrate that it’s possible to forge ahead despite the circumstances. I’m expecting plenty of positive energy,” said Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI), speaking to a group of journalists.Capasa went on to list the very stringent safety regulations imposed on all labels showing. For example, wearing masks is mandatory for everyone backstage, until entering the runway. Social distancing rules must be complied with. Shows are open to a handful of journalists and buyers, on average never more than 150 people, and several labels have asked guests to fill in self-declaration forms to gain access to shows.
 
“Of course, we're going through very tough times, with sales shortfalls between 25% and 30% since the start of the year. But we can’t sit and wait for the vaccine, or for things to get better. We must find the energy and the resources to live safely with the virus. We can’t grind to a halt. On the contrary, this is the time to protect our SMEs, our artisans and our emerging talents,” said Capasa, underlining how fashion is Italy's second-largest industry, and the country is the leading apparel producer in Europe, with a 41% share of revenue, compared to Germany’s 11% share and France’s 8% one.
 But while the Milan Fashion Week got properly under way on Wednesday, with shows notably by Fendi and Dolce & Gabbana, the presence of industry players in Milan has been further reduced by the renewed rise in Covid-19 cases in neighbouring countries. Some labels even struggled to find models for their shows.Concern about FranceThe situation in France is especially concerning. On Monday, the Italian government decided that all travellers coming from a number of French regions had to test negative for Covid-19 before entering the country, forcing many journalists and buyers not to travel.
 
“We are disappointed because, until Sunday night, a large number of visitors from France had confirmed their arrival, many of them due to reach Milan on Tuesday. Knowing that American and Asian visitors would not come this season, we were expecting those from Europe, from Germany, Spain and France in particular,” lamented Capasa. Only a few hundred people are likely to arrive in Milan this week, a far cry from the usual thousands. They will attend 22 physical shows, out of a total of 64 shows on the calendar, the majority of which will take place virtually.
 
Among them Versace, which had initially planned to stage a physical show, but decided a few days ago to show behind closed doors. As well as Prada, which has opted for a digital event this week to unveil the first collection co-designed by Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, and also Giorgio Armani, which will also show behind closed doors, broadcasting the event live on Italian TV.Gucci is giving this season a miss, but the Milan Fashion Week can count on Valentino. After showing in Paris for years, the Italian luxury label is making a grand come-back to Milan. In total, 159 events are scheduled on the CNMI website, between presentations, catwalk shows and special projects, either physical or digital.
 
“Luckily, we have digital options! Of course, they’re no replacement for physical shows, but digital tools have been a great help to the industry, through e-commerce solutions, virtual showrooms and the streaming of fashion week events. In July, for the Milan Fashion Week Men, our website was visited by 15 million users worldwide. This time, we’re aiming for 20 million,” said Capasa, who was also at pains to highlight the multiplicity of events in support of emerging labels organised in parallel with the official calendar.

Like the ‘Milano Moda Shoppable Project’ for example, organised by CNMI with Milanese department store La Rinascente, presented on Tuesday morning. Until October 11, La Rinascente will host, in its new fourth-floor area dedicated to pop-up stores and contemporary brands, the collections designed by 13 young Italian labels (Twins Florence, Drome, Nico Giani, Simona Marziali – MRZ, Iindaco, Vitelli, Blazé Milano, Act N°1, Marco de Vincenzo, Fantabody, Flapper | Genevieve Xhaet, Marco Rambaldi and Vìen). Their collections are also showcased in the department store’s eight shop windows, in the heart of Milan, a stone’s throw from the Duomo.
 
Also, several young Italian designers have been able to produce their collections, organise catwalk shows or produce videos thanks to funds raised by the CNMI’s Fashion Trust, via the TogetherForTomorrow project that was launched during Italy's lockdown period. 
Other initiatives focused on emerging talent are the Fashion Hub Market showroom, hosting debut collections by seven labels (Gentile Catone, Salvatore Vignola, DassùYAmoroso, Daniele Carlotta, Roni Studios, C’est la V and Francesca Marchisio), and the Milano Moda Graduate collective catwalk show, reserved to graduates from leading Italian fashion academies. In addition, there is a presentation of six labels concentrating on sustainability, and a showcase for emerging Hungarian designers.
 
And this is not all. For the first time, the Milan Fashion Week is staging an event in support of designers from racialised communities, in collaboration with the ‘Black Lives Matter in Italian Fashion’ collective, presenting the work of five stylists via a video entitled ‘We are made in Italy- The Fab Five Bridge Builders’, overseen by designers Stella Jean and Edward Buchanan.

Finally, following the disastrous explosion in Beirut in August, CNMI launched a project called ‘Spotlight on Lebanese Designers - CNMI in support of the new generation of Lebanese Talent’, enabling seven fashion designers from Lebanon to take part in the Milan Fashion Week by presenting digital content.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 24, 2020","Giorgio Armani skipped any physical presentation during Milan Fashion Week this season, but that did not prevent his video display for Emporio Armani, unveiled online Thursday morning, from packing plenty of oomph and punch. 
Armani named the video Building Dialogues and shot it in his Milan headquarters, a former Nestle chocolate factory reinvented back in 2001 by master architect Tadao Ando first as a theater. Later, the designer extended this fulcrum of his Armani fashion empire across the street into Armani Silos, his acclaimed art and fashion exhibition space.
 
Opening with drone shots of the complex, Armani had his highly mixed cast – a dozen models and as many actors, dancers and creative - move around the extended complex, capturing them in a skywalk connecting two buildings.Armani’s famous non-color palette of chalk, putty, stone and light mud have rarely looked better seen here before the elegantly austere Rationalist style buildings providing an ideal setting for this spring summer 2021 collection. 
Occasionally, phalanxes of dashing models paused ensemble, their hands raised before a massive rising sun that began as bright orange and later turned to cobalt blue as it took over an interior courtyard.
 
Armani next summer wants gals to dress in Emporio black and white Holstein print rawhide jackets and blousons; perfectly cut black-and-gray chalk-stripe suits; halter neck summer frocks; and mannish deep gorge pants suits.
 
With the camera constantly moving Giorgio showed guys in perforated leather jerkins; loose-weave knit tanks; dandy and dashing linen suits or sleeveless cotton blazers.
 
Pre-show, Armani said in a release that due to health restrains regarding travelling he wanted to create an alternative form of show, one “consisting of different talents including models, young and upcoming actors, singers, dancers and those pertaining to the world of the brand… to reach as many of the public as possible.” 
His cool gang included a gyrating Germain Louvet, a star dancer from the Opéra de Paris; Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen, star of the series The Rain, and nouveau DJ Sita Abellan. At one stage, the French twins Larry and Laurent Bourgeois were moon walking and crumping across the interiors of Silos. Balletic break dancers in contrasting looks: a rock-star, Emmy winner check black and gray check blazer or a knit deconstructed Beckham jacket in ecru and white.
 
An all-white section of faille and techy see-through and creased linens looked perfect - languid tailoring at its best. And in a witty twist a fetish turquoise-haired model with green nail varnish got passionate with a cool Lothario in a moody slate gray suit – embracing in Ando’s mini interior pond.
 
Time lapse photography of light moving across the austere putty-hued walls added to the sense of assured ease that is the heart of Armani. Directed by Leandro Manuel Emede and Nicolo Cerioni, Building Bridges was a thoroughly professional video that felt completely in synch with the Emporio aesthetic. And also introduced fans who have never been to Milan to Armani’s headquarters – whose blend of Italian graphics; Japanese design and technological optimism are a great physical statement of this unique designer’s remarkable story. Today, Armani is the proud owner of the largest and most important fashion brand on the planet still fully owned by its founder. Respect.

"Sep 23, 2020","He is one of the 20th century's most famous artists, but not many people know that Man Ray got his start as a fashion photographer.A new exhibition in Paris sets out to uncover the fashion world roots of the American surrealist, who first made his name taking flattering portraits of the rich and famous.

Like many young artists Emmanuel Radnitzky, as Man Ray was then known, had trouble making ends meet when he arrived in Paris in 1920 to plunge himself into the Dadaist movement.But the new show ""Man Ray and Fashion"" at the Luxembourg museum in the French capital sets out how his time as chronicler of the style stars of the Roaring Twenties shaped his art.

Encouraged by the couturier Paul Poiret -- the Karl Lagerfeld of his time -- the artist began to work for magazines like Vogue, Femina and Vanity Fair.

Fashion historian Catherine Ormen, who curated the show, said magazines at the time never used photos of clothes for fear that designs would be copied.

Instead they printed sketches while Man Ray photographed stylish celebrities for them.

But the artist was not content with producing glossy images of Parisian socialites.Glamour and tears""With Man Ray you start with nothing and end with photographs that are almost abstract and works of art,"" she told AFP.

Indeed one of his masterpieces, ""Glass Tears"" (1932), came from an advertising campaign for water resistant mascara.

He transformed the rather banal image using his trademark photomontage techniques which he later christened ""rayographs"".

The iconic image also spoke of Man Ray's own anger and hurt after his split with the photographer and model, Lee Miller.

The following year he became a permanent fixture in the US fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar, where the precursor of the Photoshop generation brought his abstract and surrealist experiments to a still wider public.

Among the other well-known images in the show is his famous portrait of the designer Coco Chanel in profile, her hands in her pockets and a cigarette in her mouth.

It also shines a light on the style revolution of the 1920s, when women's fashion threw off Victorian restrains to embrace freedom of movement, only to slip back to more formal attire in the 1930s, when fashionistas would change their clothes, hairstyles and even nail colours up to three times a day.

The show, which runs until January 17, is the first time the Luxembourg museum -- which is better known for Old Masters shows -- has tackled fashion.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Sep 23, 2020","Milan Fashion Week kicked off Wednesday morning with a series of virtual events: a where a quartet of brands stood out - Missoni, DSquared2, Herno and new boy on the block A Cold Wall. For a spring-summer 2021 season may be bereft of audiences, but not of ideas. 
A Cold wall: Sartorial swat team chic

The Italian season’s biggest debut was A Cold Wall, the acclaimed conceptual collection by Samuel Ross. The London-based designer makng his entry into Milan with a video entitled My Brother’s Keeper.
 
No one can ever fault Ross for his vision. His darkly short moody film had guys wrestling balletically; binding or blocking each other’s vision, as the music churned moodily. A Cold Wall stands for sartorial street cool; just like this collection, which added in an intriguing padded looks to its oeuvre for next spring – from thickened vests and waistcoats to streamlined puffers. Half through he changed gear with a series of distressed denims and faded matelassé looks in denim and techy cottons. They all looked great.
 
But the biggest news was the sartorial touches, from the combat waistcoat worn over strict suits to the padded flight jackets, all displayed to a great abstract techno soundtrack courtesy of Afrodeutsche, the Manchester-based DJ known for her eclectic polyrhythmic style.
 
For a fledgling talent restricted by the pandemic, this was an impressive entrance into Milan.
  
Missoni

Instead of a show, mini catwalk, proper presentation or even phygital event, Missoni served up its latest ad campaign as the opening calendar event of the six-day season in Milan.
 
Named Postcard from the Bel Paese, it featured Italian models Vittoria Cerretti and Eduardo Sebastianelli. The gal writing postcards; the guy strolling down medieval alleys. The pair walking arm in arm looking very in love, in the way only beautiful young Italians can.
 
“This is the right moment to break the mould and try something new. The purpose of the show has changed. It used to be to show the collection to the trade and to the press. Today, it goes immediately to the public and the final consumer… So closer to the actual season we will build a communication project,” argued designer Angela Missoni in stilted conversation with local style journalist Angelo Flocavento
 
Shot in Santa Maria del Monte, a romantic hilltop town with views of Alpine lakes, in the province of Varese, the birthplace of Missoni. Clothes wise, lots of long graphic cashmere  cardigans and pants suits, or Lurex blazers for ladies; zig zag wraps and nonchalant weekend chalk-stripe pants for the guys.
 
“My mother and father started the business in the basement of their own house. So domesticity is a part of our family, company and factory. Plus, I have a passion for old postcards, recalled Angela, noting that nearly anywhere her father went he would mail a postcard.
  
DSquared2: Not the usual suspects

DSquared2 kept things simple – with the cast of models lined up like perps in a police eyewitness identification line. Though, thankfully, the fashion was not the usual suspects.
 
Instead a band self-confident hipsters: the women in micro mini-strap little black dresses; see-through naughty negligées;  blotchy acid-dyed jazz jeans; fab elephantine khaki officers trousers worn with lace tops; or white power-shoulder boyfriend coats. Tough yet sensitive and all very flattering.
 
The guys in excellent elongated cargo party pants; tuxedo with mat black crystal lapels; MiG pilot flight jackets; chain metal tanks and aviator pants.
 
All the pants cut three inches too long to give a cool floppy silhouette, devil may care style. Plenty of flesh on display, as unlike Keyser Söze, these kids ain’t got nothing to hide.
  
Herno: A day on its Lake
The morning’s most succinct brand statement came from Herno, with a wee movie called  A day in Lesa, with leggy lasses wandering around this pretty town on the shores of Lago di Maggiore, or posing in front of Volkswagen Beetle convertibles.
 
All mixed up with great old footage of La Prima rallye della Moda; black and white catwalk shows from the 60s and old images of Herno’s factory in this lovely town, known for its grand lakeside palazzi, where the country’s poet famous novelist Alessandro Manzoni wrote his best works. The brand actually gets its name from the river Erno that flows into Lago Maggiore.
 
Gals in logo trenches and scarves; natty new raingear worn with the house’s signature lightweight down vests and boleros – worn dancing on tables in Herno’s plant; or on
to a bucolic boat trip on a classic Riva over to Stresa, where Clark Gable, Hemingway and Charlie Chaplin all summered.
 
Retro definitely, with its Italian ballad soundtrack, but rarely has an Italian apparel plant looked so sexy. Talk about smart brand building from this cleverly managed brand.

"Sep 21, 2020","The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode , French fashion’s governing body, has released the break-down of the upcoming Paris Fashion Week, revealing that 19 houses currently plan to stage actual physical shows. The most of any city in the current international runway season. 
Among the fashion brands that have committed to a live catwalk show this season in Paris are Christian Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Issey Miyake, Hermès and Yohji Yamamoto.
 
All told, there will be 84 fashion houses listed on the official calendar of Paris Fashion Week, the world’s pre-eminent runway season, due to be staged between September 28 and October 6. The season will feature spring-summer 2021 women’s ready-to-wear collections. A further 20 houses plan to organize physical presentations. And another 45 brands will produce digital displays.
 
The other dozen brands that will stage live shows are chronologically: Coperni, Victoria/Tomas, Kenzo, Gauchère, Acne, Balmain, Chloé, Isabel Marant, Koche, Paco Rabanne, Ami, Gabriela Hearst and Xuly Bet.  
“For the organization of events in Paris, the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and the houses listed on the Official Calendar of Paris Fashion Week comply with the recommendations of the public authorities. In addition, the Federation is in regular contact with the Prefecture of Police and health authorities. It has also established, within the framework of the Federation's legal and social commissions, and with the support of the Ile-de-France Regional Health Agency, a specific protocol for fashion shows and presentations,” said the Federation in a press release accompanying the complete calendar. 
 
Somewhat surprisingly, such major league brands as Balenciaga, Givenchy, Miu Miu, Dries Van Noten, Elie Saab, Loewe and Maison Margiela will not be presenting live shows during the season. Moreover, the entire opening day, which features six emerging talents and new arrivals, will be completely digital.
 
A further dozen houses will produce digital shows, and also provide physical presentations where editors and buyers can meet the designer. 
Typically, the average ready-to-wear show in Paris attracts upwards of 500 guests. And on occasion, with major brands like Dior or Chanel, over 2,000. However, this season many houses have informed FashionNetwork.com that due to social distancing they will invite less than 100 guests. 

The FHCM is also unleashing a brand new project called Sphere, a Federation showroom dedicated to emerging brands, which will be held simultaneously at the Palais de Tokyo and online. 
 
This summer, Paris Fashion Week also successfully debuted a new platform built by Launchmetrics in partnership with the Federation.
 
The FHCM has also renewed its partnerships with some of the world's largest social media players: YouTube; Google; Instagram and Facebook, and is continuing its collaboration with Hylink, China's leading independent digital communication agency, boosting links to the main social and distribution networks in China. 
 
Get set for a busy season in France.

"Sep 21, 2020","London Fashion Week’s quietest ever edition continued Monday, bereft of foreign editors and largely restricted to video displays. A season full of historical references; retro ideas; odd wee films and even powerful call for respect for immigrants in a UK, where the popular press have begun reporting from the south coast of England as if it were the scene of a foreign invasion.Erdem: Emma Hamilton at her best
A beautiful natural setting for Erdem, two long lines of oaks trees deep inside Epping Forest, and the latest instalment of the designer’s haute aristocratic romanticism, albeit with tragic undertones.

Referencing the complicated love triangle in 18th century Naples between Emma Hamilton, her husband, the British consul Sir William Hamilton, and the legendary Horatio Nelson, captured in Susan Sontag’s novel The Volcano Lover.Hence Emma Hamilton in the Bourbon court of Naples, attired in Directoire high-waisted
dresses; Grecian goddess silhouettes; gentile drapery; and simple light-weight chemises thrown over the shoulder. Hair worn loose; pearls in their ears; ribbons flowing from many collars and lapels; bows jutting out, the cast strolled confidently down the avenue of tress. The Ancien Régime being overthrown by revolutionary ideas in an utterly charming collection.

“Emma Hamilton… is a character of great gumption, who started life as the daughter of a Cheshire blacksmith and rose to become a powerful political player. In the shadow of the volcano, she is a force to be reckoned with. Unrelenting in the face of adversity, she carved opportunity out of misfortune, purpose from insecurity, passion from chaos. How might we do likewise?” muses Erdem Moralioglu in his program notes, speaking to our current need for passionate heroines.

Victoria Beckham

“Limitations can be liberating. Working remotely for this collection we reacted spontaneously. We were instinctive,” opined Victoria Beckham, perched on a massive patchwork quilt sofa inside a London art gallery.

Insisting the key word this season was “eclectic,” Beckham showed a very varied series of looks - oversized mat khaki or lime parkas; gathered floor length dresses;  crisp career-gal blazers; perfectly cut cricket jackets; classy asymmetric mannish shirts; leopard print coats; and mega flared pants.  All finished with huge chain necklaces with square and round pendants;  and completed by new natty nerdy eyewear in a collection of just 21 looks.

Instead of marching past the usual quotient of VIPs; hubby David and assembled family, the cast  strolled between works of art inside the Victoria Miro art gallery in Mayfair. Which, curiously, was pretty liberating too.


JW Anderson: Shopping with Harry and Emma
Rather than a show, or presentation this was just a very odd shopping expedition in Soho, where Harry Lambert and Emma Corrin, after coffees, did a tour around the Northern Irish designer’s central London store. Endlessly describing bags, flight jackets, and coats as “really cute” or “it’s so sick” or “insane.” Yes, not exactly a fashion tutorial. Before, Anderson appears in a brief cameo and the pair wrap up a few purchases. Quite what the point of the exercise was was hard to work out. But at least, a blurb informed viewers that Anderson will show another video next Monday where he will properly premiere his spring-summer 2021 collection.Osman Yousefzada: Frantz Fanon fashion
A feminist and full-forced take on Black Lives Matter from Osman Yousefzada, the talented designer son of a Muslim Pashtun family that moved to Birmingham.

“My bindis, locks and traditional frock. More than a fashion statement. More than appropriated symbols of identity. More than part adornment of privilege. They are symbols of my survival. You have a history of theft, taking from us, putting us on ships; shackling our hearts and splendor, enslaving us for your profit,” intones the narrator Makayla Ford, a lone drum slowly beating in the background.

Beauties of many colors marched and twisted around wild UK beaches, or forgotten airfields. Intercut with images of protest by feminists, Labour Party activists, or immigrants queuing for passports.  Dressed in flowing robes in cerulean blue; hand-dyed shawls; white puckered gowns; studded leather bustiers; or mannish cotton double-breasted jackets. All fitted out with rich Rajasthan jewelry, large earring loops, abundant necklaces – made by artisanal communities in India and Pakistan.

Fashion as a call for tolerance, and the rallying cry for justice in an impressive collection. Frantz Fanon fashion, and a video entitled Here to Stay, the chant of Osman’s older relatives in the '80s when they fought against police brutality and for equal access to education.

"Sep 21, 2020","It felt a little like a repeat season in London this Sunday, with a series of largely digital displays where many designers actually repackaged collections they had shown in January or February. Often with impressive results, like at Palmer Harding and Liam Hodges. Though the stand-out moment of London Fashion Week was the latest installment of Lulu Kennedy’s joint show for emerging talent, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this month with a stand-out quartet. 
Never has London’s reputation as the world’s best incubator of talent seemed so true. Post-lockdown, the London digital season felt like a hatchery, and its most important influence is talent seeker extraordinaire Kennedy.
 
Fashion East
More ideas and energy, vim and vigor in this group show by the latest young hopefuls mined by Kennedy. Cool street tailoring; racy cut-off silhouettes and bodycon brilliance from Maximilian Davis, a Wales Bonner alumni. Talk about raw talent.Or take Goomheo of South Korea – Morris dancers encounter Satyricon cross dressers, shot from an ankle-high camera angle. Even better, Nensi Dojaka and some sensational see-through boudoir cool from this Albanian hopeful collaged onto sunset, time-lapse views of London, Paris and Tokyo. Or best of Saul Nash with a video named ""Luas Flipside"" – tracking shots on an English Channel cliff top featuring chopped-up technical, active sports gear for urban living. Be warned! Adidas or Nike need to hire Saul.
 
""Looking back over twenty years of helping London’s best designers is wild! I’m incredibly grateful I’ve been able to do what I love doing best. I wouldn’t change a thing,"" commented Kennedy, who can be justly proud of her unique role and contribution. 
Palmer Harding clan council
All in the family at Palmer Harding, where designers Matthew Harding and Levi Palmer focused on their extended clans, shooting and reshooting their winter collection featuring exclusive and previously unseen styles on family members, in both the UK and the USA. 
 
From the UK, with several generations of Harding women, all the way to the extended Palmer network captured via zoom, including mother Nancy shot in her home town of Westphalia, Texas and his mentor Jan shot in downtown Dallas. Self-described as ""Levi’s fashion fairy godmother"" and dressed in a marvelous Imperial Roman purple coat, wandering among fantastic life-sized bronze statues of Texas longhorns. Telling, charming and ideal aesthetics from this thoughtful design duo.
 
Per Götesson keeps it short
A silent video largely just of a bald man, mostly undressed, sometimes wearing a crocheted mini dress, often with his head covered in crystals. Graphic collages reminiscent of Russian Constructivism, and the final tagline: ""We have worked hard all our lives and now we have all these beautiful things."" Even in a season of spare mini video fashion statements, this felt far too modest.
 Emilio de la Morena musing on Lockdown
Emilio presented one of those videos that made one miss the giddy atmosphere of London. Entitled ""5 Troubles,"" it had six figures dancing and gesticulating in graffiti-plastered underpasses, blocks of council flats or in urban parks. The clothes? Well, they were sort of an afterthought of monocolor stretch exercise gear. Not that much fashion news, but as a brand statement it rocked.
 
Liam Hodges’ Ciao Bella
This designer didn’t even bother presenting a new collection, instead he repackaged his last collection, called ""Brave New World,"" and renamed it ""Ciao Bello."" The resulting video had lots of Italian food, from pizza to tortellini with pesto, and all sorts of folk drinking heavily. Then images of what looked like rooftop Milan and a shoot in Artifact, with sweatshirts roped into Joseph Beuys sculptures. Turned out these clubbing clothes looked pretty fierce and snappy, even if we had seen them all before.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 20, 2020","Leave it to Simone Rocha to present the most brilliant collection this weekend at London Fashion Week: high ethereal romanticism located somewhere between Jane Austen and Catherine de' Medici.
  
On a Saturday in London largely bereft of opportunities to see actual clothes up close, Rocha unveiled her latest ideas in the Mayfair Gallery of her old pals Hauser & Wirth.
 
Due to social distancing, guests were limited to a few score editors, buyers and friends, but Rocha had already telegraphed her intentions with a series of photos by photographer Jacob Lillis showing delicate embroidered and beaded objects – part mask, part decoration, part bra – or a still life of a white silk dress with heraldic stamps.In the end, the designer billed the event on social media as ""Sharing Today,"" opening with rather divine ball gowns cut so they enveloped the shoulder in clouds of taffeta or cloqué.
 
This season, Rocha’s clothes were imbued with plenty of feminine escapism, yet her pieces are always feminist in the sense that their delicacy and sheer beauty evoke a desire by women to dress on their own terms with a certain rare sensibility. Unlike the characters in Austen’s novels, her clients are not dependent on their choice of husbands for economic security, but like the writer’s heroines they seek a life of distinction and good taste, far removed from so much of the sensationalism one can find in so many other designers today. Or so many gothic writers of Jane’s time.
 
The mood always varies when Rocha works in black, adding oomph and more spine to her aesthetic. Her flared dresses with leg of mutton sleeves had a courtly and regal air worthy of Catherine de' Medici. None of the 29 looks in this Spring/Summer 2021 collection included a ruffled neck collar, the Italian-born regent’s signature touch, yet the grandeur and voluminous silhouettes of rich golden or black satin dresses harked back to the Renaissance queen. Even if Catherine never had the gumption to wear her dresses cut off just below the knee and finished with sexy black tights. Other black outfits recalled the stylized ink drawings of artist Kara Walker and her pastoral fantasies; the whole collection very smartly styled by Robbie Spencer at Art Partner.

""Sobering and exploding, Pragmatic and foreboding, Personal, provocative, suggestive intimacy, excavating… Hand-embroidered castles from a faraway place,"" read Rocha’s typically evocative program notes. 

Many of the self-confident cast appeared anchored by multi-strap Cinderella ballet slippers in pearly satin, or on sporty platform sneaker-style getas trimmed with pearls. Rocha also showed new versions of her signature egg-shaped bag, this time in silvery hues and dangling from long straps of pearls, rather like a medieval thurible.
 
A sense of the sacred all the way to the color palette, which Rocha described with an almost biblical reference: ""Amber, gold & Myrrh.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 20, 2020","An almost completely digital day at London Fashion Week, marked by multiple energetic videos and the almost complete absence of actual runway models. 
From Marques’Almeida, where a lone dancer André Cabral gyrated with angst and effervescence to the music of Orlando, to 16Arlington, where three models were seen drinking water from a conch or pouring it out of a carafe over their bodies, this was a runway season where one got to see very few clothes. That said, there where plenty of noble artistic expressions by designers grappling with the conundrum: what does fashion mean at a tragic moment when thousands are being struck down, bereft even of the presence of their families?
 
Molly Goddard
Molly did at least stage a phygital show, set in a white-walled art gallery, with gals striding along an all-white mini catwalk.A simple show for a succinct and sexy collection. Goddard may wrap women up in oodles of puckered, gathered and ruffled fabrics, but they always look alluring, never prim. Her clothes are Instagram eye-catching but always cool, from the baby doll pink dresses to the pinafores worn over baggy pants, to the splendid Victorian rocker femmes fatales in uber-bright Pop Art colors. No amount of lockdown has stymied Goddard’s joie de vivre.  After one week of shows in New York and London this was the most upbeat collection by far.

Bethany Williams
Bethany Williams made an impassioned call for tolerance and welcome for refuges backed up by a brilliant prose poem by Eno Mfon.
 
""They’ll tell you they will turn away a child based on their parents’ postcode,"" read the poet, as the cast marched in the fine color blocking styles of Williams, before some superb giant illustration backdrops by Melissa Kitty Jarram. A telling and timely comment in London, a city crammed with foreign-born fashion designers at a moment when refugees are treated as enemies in the popular press. 
Art School
Art School actually staged a surrogate show, models marching down a Victorian park in full bloom. Austere black leather or waxy cotton coat dresses, tunics, trenches and shorts, anchored by military boots and accessorized with chains. Cut-up khaki military references and posh punk attitude from the brand’s designer Eden Loweth.
 
With so many creators obsessed with naturalism and escapism, this hard core survivalist chic was a bold statement, and somehow very needed. Spare, simple but packing plenty of punch.

Jordan Luca in a Laundromat
Fans whirling; cheap old machines, some out of order; bored youths lying on benches; archaic old computers projecting body builders, muscle queens with nipple rings or youth on roundabouts
 
Italian commentary as the design team sit around sewing and ironing: ""Always dear to me this hermit’s hill… Spaces beyond it, and superhuman Silences, and profoundest stillness. In thought I do pretend.""
 
Funky Londoners in flower-print black shirts, worn cotton jerkins, mega high lapel double-breasted jackets and tie-dye shirts, some of them blowing the stems of dandelions. A cheap, wee video, but one coherent for this brand. 
Oliver Spencer
Not a runway show, nor a presentation, nor performance art, nor even a silly video, instead this season’s offering from Oliver Spencer was a faintly hokey ad for Mercedes Benz. Specifically, the new EQC luxury compact SUV, driven by one of Britain’s best dressed men, Richard Biedul, who actually instructs the car to take him to Spencer’s home and then drives it himself anyway.
 
""What a motor mate. It looks like a space ship,"" says Spencer, admiring the car outside his redbrick pad. 
 
""It’s the perfect London car. It’s stylish, functional,"" says Biedul of the auto from Mercedes Benz, a key sponsor of London Fashion Week, in this rather lame product placement.
 
""I am really excited about what they are doing at LFW this week. They are really stepping up,"" 
says Spencer, without providing any specifics.
 
Billed as a discussion of sustainability, Spencer did at least show a rack of clothes: crisp check French linen shirts, ""where every single element of the plant is used, the linen in fabrics, the stems for cattle feed."" Or what he described as the “suit of the future, a totally deconstructed costume in Supima, the cashmere of cotton. 
Stephen Jones Millinery: Analogue Fairydust
Hard to think of any greater hatter in fashion, or indeed on the planet than Stephen Jones, who entitled his latest escapade into noble design ""Analogue Fairydust.""
 
Despite the ""Analogue"" in the title, his model was hyper virtual, Noonoouri, the Mitteleuropean avatar, the same lady he used in his summer men’s collection.
 
Swirling fluted shapes inspired by Disney classic Fantasia and superb blue leopard-print ten-gallon hats for torrid Texans worn on a lady avatar sporting an Edwardian moustache. 
 
""May all your hatty dreams come true,"" commented Jones, dressed in a distressed chalk-hued blazer and a white fedora with an enormous black band. May they indeed.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 18, 2020","Few designers in London today pack as much punch and panache as Edward Crutchley, whose latest collection was an ode to a beautifully histrionic Yakuza gangster film, and all the better for that.

Defining his collection as ""something gritty, something pretty,"" Crutchley took the Hideo Gosha’s obscure cult flick Gokudô no onna-tachi, generally translated as 'Wives of Japanese Yakuza', and reinvented the glam, yet grisly melodrama as fab fashion-forward luxury. All packed into a four-minute tech-y video shot in a simulacrum of a Berlin techno club.Dressing guys and gals in the similar fabrics in this co-ed collection. Modern day geishas with nihongami wigs with oodles of attitude. Or post-colonial dandies, who rocked up at a Yakuza initiation ceremony, but manage not to get their end of their little finger cut off in the rite.

Crutchley cuts with great skill – from his swirling skirts and crisp blazers, to his regally revamped kimonos for ladies; all the way to the jet black reconstructed kimono for gents, finished with embroidered crystal hearts and fruits. Posh pearly men on a rampage in Yokohama.Last summer, Crutchley staged a memorable collection evoking Thatcherite Britain, subverting the idea with a multi-ethnic cast and ironic takes on country-house chintz. Evoking the ‘80s, “the last time it wasn’t cool to be British.” This season, he took his ideas to another level: historical gender-bending, by Britain’s snappiest new tailor.

If one checks out the name Edward Crutchley on Wikipedia, readers should be aware that this fashionable Edward Crutchley is not the same Edward Crutchley who scored a century for Harrow, playing against Eton at Lord’s in 1939. Yet another reason why we caught up with London Fashion Week’s Edward Crutchley to learn more about his opulent sense of aesthetics.FashionNetwork.com: Hello Edward. Why did you want to deconstruct Yakuza this season?
Edward Crutchley: I suppose it was a bit of a lockdown moment of madness. I don’t want to think about sweatpants, and I wanted some escaping and fantasy. Something that feels apart from all this awfulness. A Japanese hairdresser friend of mine suggested the movie, and the influence just grew.

FN: Where did you get all the great prints?
EC: Well, I knew was going to be digital online. So I realized doing things that were bright and have big scale to them was vital.

FN: And what inspired all the kimono ideas?
EC: One of them was actually a reworking of a print we did for spring/summer 2017 that was inspired by a kimono that I found in Tokyo. I do have a small kimono collection, only about 60 actually [laughs]. One came from a little shop I found, from a textile student art project in 1930's that had to mix traditional Japanese and Art Deco influences. I loved that idea. The one in red was from kimono shopping in lockdown – No opera costumes that I found. So I bought five! Originally, it was black and gold and starker, so I brought in 80's lighting disco, and degradé and off it went. The third was from a jewelry group. That was inspired by a blouse from Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote, which has always been a big influence on me.

FN: What is the starting point of your collections?
EC: They can really come from anywhere. I don’t feel I need for one direct idea – the world we live not mono-color.

FN: You are from in the North of England?
EC: Yes, Yorkshire – in the Dales. I first came to London in 1999, and graduated from St Martin’s in 2003.

FN: And, you worked in Louis Vuitton with Kim Jones, right?
REC: I’ve been in Paris since 2007. First working with Louis Vuitton, before Kim, and then after he came. I then went with him to Dior. So, that is my background – international luxury.

FN: I see a unique sense of opulence meeting historical clothing about your collections, especially the tailoring, right?
EC: Tailoring became more of my focus, maybe less this season. This time I wanted post-Covid relaxed. This is my casual silhouette. But I don’t ever want to do tracksuits!

FN: Where is your studio in London?
EC: I don’t have one! Never really felt the need for one. I work where I am, I don’t cut and drape. I like to work directly with factories and production partners. So, I don’t feel it necessary. I work on the move and digitally – all my sketches are done on a computer, which does mean that my house is full of boxes of old samples!

FN: What did you want to achieve with your video?
EC: I wanted to give everyone a little bit of the experience of sitting in a front row – things going past you at different angles -- and a really strong sense of movement, and dynamism. And I think it does.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 18, 2020","London rocked on Friday morning with a blend of acclaimed historicism and funky, unexpected street wear. There were practically no actual shows in the UK capital yet plenty of ideas in a handful of memorable video displays. Clothes for next summer, when fashion designers want their customers to rage freely. 
Marrknull

A windy quarry, with a score of Asian gals strolling hair astray on a wild ridge. All looking like they had been out all night partying. One long fabulous final drone shot capturing the whole scene, as a juggernaut truck swings around the ridge where the models stand in formation. Voluminous asymmetrical blouses; waxed patent leather cocktails; darling deconstructed trousers – in one of the most inventively cut collections in ages. A unisex ready-to-wear brand from Beijing, founded by Wang Wei and Tim Shi,  Marrknull is all about recomposing Chinese traditional clothing with a certain sort of deconstructed bedraggled grace.Inspired by Chinese 1980s movie In the Wild Mountains directed by Yan Xueshu, a tale of two women fighting for their lives during the convulsions of rural reform in China, this was brilliantly succinct vision of edgy nobility.
 Vivienne Westwood

Savile Row met Restoration punks in a kicky and great agit-prop statement from the reigning queen of British fashion Vivienne Westwood.
 
Unisex to the max with magnificent windowpane check looks – dandy double breasted for the guys and saucy coat dresses for the gals.Buttoned-up cardigans coupled with bare chests. Fantabulous proportions with blown up collars, turn-ups, pockets, buttons in fencing shirts and tartan rebel suits. Masks that read True Punk.
 
Fashion as a statement both of aesthetic rebellion and anger at a world being destroyed by greedy corporations and duplicitous politicians. Westwood’s designer partner Andreas Kronthaler also had the smart idea of linking up with Chrissie Hynde and incorporating the rocker’s prints in this collection, adding more kick. 

“Buy less, dress up, swap clothes…. Dress for the time of day, or don’t dress for the time of day – wear your evening clothes to the office if you go back to work, mix seasons – our aim is to show only one collection a year,” explained Westwood, still a truly important designer at 79 years.
 LYPH 

A great little video entitled Grid Girls and Pitt Boyz for UK brand LYPH, shot in some tumbled down English industrial derelict sites and streets. 
 
Graphic nylon parkas; neoprene donkey jackets; all weather gear for ravers; color blocking clubbing clothes.  Three-fingered salutes from dudes wearing baggy denims with jagged script inside Kanteena market. No shortage of attitude, and just right for next summer.
 Preen by Thornton Bregazzi

Canal boat romanticism. Make that six girls in a boat at Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, where the cast ambled up an Olde England canal in a ruffled, curvaceous, Victorian frocks with tulip cuffs and erratic embroidery.  Entitled Stitch me Back Together, this was something of a modest statement from Preen. Which on its day is one of the most innovative collections in London. Perhaps because these designers often seek inspiration from far distant ideas this lockdown-conditioned collection felt far too restrained.

"Sep 18, 2020","The City of Toronto's Fashion Industry Advisory Panel (FIAP) launched on Thursday a campaign aimed to bring awareness to Toronto's fashion industry, and celebrate its perseverance in the wake of the challenging year. Dubbed “#SupportTorontoFashion”, the campaign will span several weeks and will highlight the people, brands, and institutions that make up the industry.

The campaign will specifically take a look at people in tech, sustainability, inclusivity and ethical standards in the fashion industry, who have contributed to making Toronto's fashion industry what it is today. Their stories will be shared via daily social media broadcasts. The campaign launched with a video message of support from the city’s mayor, John Tory. 

""We have a lot to be proud of when it comes to Toronto fashion. We are the home of iconic people and popular brands that are known and celebrated globally. Toronto is a leading force in the fashion industry and that recognition starts right here with us today,"" said Tory, in a news statement. 

""I encourage everyone to support local and to support the Toronto Fashion campaign so that together we can help our city's fashion industry.”

Toronto’s fashion industry has taken actions to fight the spread of Covid-19, since the beginning of the epidemic. Toronto is home to brands like Canada Goose, which helped produce personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers across the country, while brands like Peace Collective launched fundraising collections. 

Before the pandemic, Toronto's fashion industry employed 50,000+ people and contributed more than $1 billion in annual wages.

FIAP launched in 2018 with a mandate to provide advice and support to the City of Toronto on fashion industry issues and opportunities to promote the long-term viability of its fashion and apparel sector.

""The Fashion Industry Advisory Panel represents a cross-section of Toronto's fashion industry ecosystem. It was purposefully formed to be comprehensive in its approach to the different sectors that make up Toronto's fashion industry,"" said FIAP chair and branding and fashion lawyer, Ashlee Froese. 

""The #SupportTorontoFashion campaign is a culmination of Toronto's fashion industry leaders bringing awareness to the complexity, depth and value of Toronto's fashion industry to the Toronto consumer. It needs your support now more than ever.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 18, 2020","Rihanna has announced that the second fashion show of her Savage x Fenty lingerie brand will be broadcast via Amazon Prime on October 2 and will feature a diverse cast of celebrities, musicians and models. 
In an Instagram post published on Thursday, the entertainer and entrepreneur revealed a short video accompanied by the caption “#SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW VOL. 2! It’s going down Oct. 2 on @amazonprimevideo!”
 
The video shows the singer making backstage preparations for the show in a facemask and face shield, before the words “Y’all ain’t ready” flash across the screen, followed by “Savage not sorry.”The clip also reveals that the show will feature performances from Travis Scott, Rosalía, Miguel, Bad Bunny, Mustard, Roddy Ricch, and Ella Mai.
 
On top of this, the video provides an extensive list of other celebrities who will be featuring in the show, including singer Lizzo, actress Demi Moore, and models Cara Delevingne, Bella Hadid, Willow Smith, Christian Combs, Irina Shayk, Paloma Elsesser and Miss 5th Ave.
 
Socialite Paris Hilton will also be taking part, along with rappers Big Sean, Rico Nasty and Chika, singers Normani and Erika Jayne, actress Laura Harrier, and RuPaul’s Drag Race-winning drag queens Shea Couleé and Jaida Essence Hall.
 
The show follows on from the first Savage x Fenty show in September 2019, which saw a diverse cast of models and other celebrities take to the runway in spectacular fashion to reveal the label’s second collection.
 
With its emphasis on diversity, the show was favorably received by critics and fans alike, who contrasted the event’s inclusive approach with the famous lingerie fashion shows hosted by Victoria´s Secret, a brand facing mounting criticism for its super-sexualized image and narrow definition of beauty, which many felt were outdated.
 
No further details have been provided about the second runway outing for Savage x Fenty, but even a summary glance at its cast suggests that inclusivity will once again be a key focus of the event, which is shaping up to be another runway spectacular from the brand.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 17, 2020","Raf Simons has announced plans to show his signature collections next month, when the Belgian designer will finally debut a women’s collection.In a terse press statement, Simons noted that he is still working out the exact format for the unveiling, but the big news is that Simons will present a women’s collection, some 25 years after first opening his brand.

“On October 23rd, Raf Simons will present both his men’s and his first women’s collection in a format to be announced at a later date,” the house announced in the release datelined Antwerp, the Belgian fashion capital where his company is based.The decision means that Simons, one of fashion’s most influential designers, will present his signature ideas almost exactly one month after he presents his debut collaboration collection with Miuccia Prada for her house during Milan Fashion Week on September 24.

Simons added that starting October 26th, both male and female collections will be available for the buyers via a virtual showroom.

The 52-year-old Simons launched his own house in 1995, shortly after finishing studies at Antwerp's Royal Academy fashion school, and debuted a runway collection in Paris in 1997, immediately winning acclaim for his youthquake style and techno subculture aesthetic. In the past decade and a half he has been successively the creative director of the fashion houses of Jil Sander, Christian Dior and Calvin Klein, making him one of the industry’s most watched creators.

"Sep 17, 2020","Italian fashion entrepreneur Claudio Antonioli has acquired Antwerp-based Ann Demeulemeester. The designer, who exited her namesake label seven years ago, welcomed the news that the New Guards Group co-founder has taken control and said he’ll bring a new energy to the firm.The label had been controlled by CEO Anne Chapelle who was a long-time executive at the firm and acquired a stake in 2005. 

Antonioli’s interest in the brand was rumoured as far back as the spring. It’s not known how much he paid for the company but the deal includes the firm’s Antwerp HQ and flagship, its Paris showroom and its full archive.The brand saw the exit of its creative director Sébastian Meunier In the summer. He’d been at the firm for a decade and at the creative helm since being appointed by Demeulemeester herself to take over on her retirement.

The company has no new creative director lined up as yet but has said it’s planning to show at Paris Fashion Week next March.

The combination of Demeulemeester and Anontioli is certainly a powerful one. Demeulemeester was one of the major names who turned Antwerp into a key fashion city. Antonioli, who runs the Italian retail chain and webstore of the same name, has long been known as a man who fosters new talent and independent labels. It will be interesting to see the direction in which he takes his new acquisition.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 17, 2020","On the penultimate day of this week's New York Fashion Week calendar, vivid looks reigned supreme, as designers focused on joy and optimism. Bibhu MohapatraBibhu Mohapatra's spring/summer 2021 collection for his eponymous brand was inspired by 20th century Indian painter, Amrita Sher-Gil, whose paintings incorporate both a soft and acidic use of color. Following suit, the collection featured a number of dramatic dresses and skirts in rose, soft blue, black and acid green; skirts in cream and lemony yellow, and footwear in baby blue and fuchsia. The collection was showcased in a video presented on Runway360, featuring models wearing the SS21 pieces in a painter's studio. 

""Amrita Shergil is one such change-maker who revolutionized and challenged the Indian art scene, albeit way ahead of her times,"" the brand said. ""With her bold and daring approach towards her life and her artistic milieu she charted the path for the future generations of artists who pledged to continue her legacy of change and challenged the norm. [The] Bibhu Mohapatra spring 2021 collection is inspired by the works and life of Amrita Sher-Gil and her fundamentally Indian spirit.""Cinq à SeptNew York-based, French-chic brand Cinq à Sept chose its spring 2021 collection to pay homage to the beauty of nature, playing on the contrast between the brand's home in New York City and the wild great outdoors. 

Dresses with tiers of ruffles and puff sleeves; satiny tops, pants and shorts in crimson, tan, white and deep blue; and a number of sets featuring Ikat floral and woodblock zebra prints were served up ""as a reaction to the difficult times the world was facing,"" the brand said. 

""The prints and colors for spring 2021 translate feelings of freedom and breeziness that we longed for during months of isolation. Fire corals, acid yellows, and peacock blue hues are direct results of wanting to return to the scenic outdoors. This season there is an appreciation for having the freedom to explore and take advantage of nature’s rich offerings of color and texture,"" it continued.Maxhosa Africa South African knitwear brand Maxhosa Africa, led by designer Laduma Ngxokolo, was yet another brand to focus on optimism in its spring/summer 2021 collection. 

Entitled 'Ingumangaliso Imisebenzi Kathixo' or 'God's Work is Magical', the collection included a range of bright, intricately patterned knitwear tops, collared shirts, jackets, pants, skirts and dresses in lush pinks, yellows, purples and blues -- occasionally accompanied by a knit bucket hat, undone head wrap or balaclava. Presented in a streamed runway show format, models walked through a room decorated with vivid woven tapestries, throw pillows, rugs and furniture. 

""This is the brightest collection I have made thus far,"" said Ngxokolo. ""This collection aims to bring positivity and inject a positive sense of happiness into the world, going against the odds that have happened in 2020. We are trying to appeal to people and encourage them to be at their happiest.""Sandy LiangAfter hosting her first runway show in September, New York City-based designer Sandy Liang presented her namesake brand's spring/summer 2021 collection with a fashion film, depicting different models sporting pieces in different parts of the city, while text of an ambiguous one-sided dialogue played across screen.

""What is this?"" the dialogue reads, ""Now, Now, you should change! Why? You're going to capture a Clow Card now, right Sakura?"" 

""I'm happy you understand how I feel! So, Sakura, go change! I also have hats for each outfit!"" 

Highlights of the collection include a variety of shirts and dresses featuring a large doll print, a loose cream trapeze dress, an oversized army green parka and a number of multi-colored, wide-collared fleece jackets.

"Sep 16, 2020","A decade ago, Arkadiusz Likus opened Vitkac, and realized a long-held dream – launching, what is still today, Warsaw’s one and only truly fashionable department store. He’s a quintessentially Polish character, who speaks excellent English with a serious Slavic tone, and yet he freely confesses that he got his game plan from one of fashion’s greatest ever executives – the late Yves Carcelle of Luis Vuitton.It was back in 2011 that Likus opened Vitkac in Warsaw when Poland was still a fashion backwater. Creating a rather unique space – a novel hybrid between sophisticated concept boutique and swish specialty department store.

Today, Vitkac, pronounced Vik Kas, is a dynamic business, boasting cult roof-top restaurant; key London, Milan and Paris runway brands; and an eight-figure plus turnover, making it the supreme fashion destination in the Polish capital. Born in the stately Baroque city of Cracow, the 41-year-old Likus studied economics and politics at Queen Mary university in London, before returning to read philosophy at Warsaw University. He comes from a noted commercial family, who also own Warszawa Hotel, the hip new destination where Elle von Unwerth has lensed shoots for Polish Vogue.With a single-minded focus he has created a destination store. Make that two, as he threw open the doors to a new store in his hometown last year; and a significant online present, notably with a link-up with FarFetch. So, we caught up with Likus to hear his stake on how he reinvented the fashion paradigm in Warsaw; managing a department store during the pandemic; and how Poland’s increasingly intolerant government is impacting his brand and his staff.


FashionNetwork.com: How and why did you found Vitkac?
Arkadiusz Likus: It’s been a dream since I was a small boy. Back when I was 8 years old during Communism my uncle remarkably got a visa to go to Germany. That really didn’t happen that often! And my mother took me out of school for one week, saying ‘who knows the next time you will see the West?’ So we went to Berlin and I saw KaDeWe and right away it became my biggest dream to have a department store in Poland. So, when I came back to gray, Communistic Poland, I promised myself I would do everything not to live in this sort of country.

FN: How did you get into fashion?
AL: I’ve always been interested in it, even when there was nothing in the stores here. I began cutting clothes for myself, and for my mother. My mother was unbelievably fashionable. Then, I even did my own collection, but quickly realized I am better at math’s and business.

FN: What is concept behind Vitkac?
AL: The genesis of Vitkac was supposed to be a Polish Harvey Nichols. I had got to know that store in London, when I studied there. But Harvey Nicks was unable to secure the key tenants and brands for their opening. So, I went to the brands and they asked me did I want to take the risk and do it myself. About that time, I managed to meet Yves Carcelle, when I was just 25. I showed him our project and I still remember he said, ‘I like this, let me give you my advice.’ And I wrote it all down, exactly as he said. Yves was probably the best advice anywhere in the market. And, in the end, it became somewhere between Selfridges and Dover Street Market, a department store that feels like a concept store. A blend of monobrand; shops in shops and lots of curated exclusive collections, which I think Yves would have liked.
 
FN: What does the name Vitkac mean?
AL: It’s the name of my favorite artist, Witkiewicz, who lived in first half of the 20th century. A painter, poet and writer who revolutionized theater and photography here. The Da Vinci of 20th century Poland. A highly experimental individual – who even painted even under influence of drugs and included cigarettes, coffee and nicotine on his canvases.  FN: Which global brands to you retail?
AL: Over 180 brands: Vuitton, of  course, Gucci Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent; balanced with names like Balmain, Givenchy, Ann Demeulemeester, Vetements and Off-White. The key brands in my view. But I want to stress that over the last five years our focus has been on experience, so the feeling of the store is very different. Five years ago I started to explain to my people  leading Vikkac, that the era of a beautiful store with beautiful brands is over. Stores now have to bring their own Value Added to their boutique. The personal comforts of our clients is the most important thing. They must want to spend time in our store. So they come in with a smile and leave with a smile. That is the prime objective. Sales will come later, as a positive derivative.

FN: Who designed the building?
AL: Stefan Kurylowicz, who sadly died in plane crash. He was the number one architect in Poland. The building itself belongs to my family and I rent from them. Now, I am in negotiations to buy it!

FN: What is your annual turnover?
AL: Last year – 500 million zlotys, or about 110 million euros.

FN: How has the pandemic impacted Vitkac?
AL: Actually, in a strangely positive. It’s interesting to read about all the trouble with department stores in the US , UK and Paris. It’s true we did close for nearly two months in March and April.  But on that very first Saturday, I set out a new strategy to my managers for the next two months. We cut no wages; we fired nobody and I expected everyone to meet Monday morning and listen to what we were going to do. We took every member of staff and organized them with telephones, computers and desks. And, using  WhatsApp, Zoom and video we managed in two months to reach close 30% sales for the same period in 2019. We opened up a new chapter; creating a drive-through booth, like McDonald’s, where customers could come to our building. A luxury drive through where you could receive shopping inside a booth. Where one did not have to touch anything - from credit cards to purchases, which were  placed directly in boot of the car. We were the first people to do something like this.

FN: Who is the owner?
AL: Well, 96% belongs to me, and the rest to a family friend. We are not listed on a stock exchange.

FN: Who is tour target customer?
AL: Fashion people and forward looking individuals. We have 20,000 SKUs and we buy always fashion forward ideas. Which makes the brands we work with very happy. When I was designing Vitkac 20 years ago, all the major stores  had huge beauty departments on the ground floor. I opened up with accessories and shoes on the ground floors. No beauty! I didn’t want fake traffic, but customers who really buy fashion.

FN: How important is your rooftop restaurant Concept 13?
AL: We have great restaurant, Michelin recommended. International cuisine but with a concept that changes four times a year. It has a 360 view of Warsaw, along with a conference area and a free kinder garden. At the weekend, we often have 20 to 30 kids with animations, which makes the dads and the mums who are shopping happy. We thought that the parents would come to get rid of their kids someplace. Now, the kids want to come, and they are our future customers.

FN: What is your long-term strategy?
AL: To grow. I opened a second department store in October in Cracow, our second largest city and the one with the highest number of tourists. All our brands are on board. The only real difference is that the store in Cracow is in a 17th century building.

FN: How has luxury retailing been doing in Poland?
AL: Honestly, at the start it was very difficult. I wondered every morning if I would have to close the business. But then, for last five years, it has developed. Double digit annual growth with 30 or 40 percent increases.

FN: So are you confident in the future?
AL: Yes. Poland is getting richer and richer and there is lots of money coming from the European Union. Unless this huge pandemic really ruins things, we will have a great future, even if only low double digits per year.

FN: Seen from Western Europe, Poland has very problematic politics. Often repressive towards LGBT people. What is your view of your country’s politics?
AL: I don’t like to get involved in politics. However, unfortunately, this is a sad cycle for the country, right  when Poland is growing very fast. The government can do a lot of harm internationally. Harm also to my staff, many of whom  are from the LGBT community.  Maybe not here in Warsaw but in secondary cities. Which is where many of my staff emigrated from. The atmosphere there is not good. Three of my best workers are working in Selfridges because they felt they had to leave Poland and move to London. Colorful amazing people with great manners and humanity.

"Sep 16, 2020","The second day of New York Fashion Week continued to touch on the previous day's themes of hope and pointed social commentary, while also leaning into daydreams of global travel.  NYMDThe day's events included Anna Sui's spring 2021 presentation, as well as a fully digital schedule for New York Men's Day, broadcasted on the CFDA's Runway360. Brands Carter Young, David Hart, Future Lovers of Tomorrow, Stan, Teddy Vonranson and Timo Weiland presented menswear, while Apotts, Ka Wa Key, Official Rebrand and Watatru Tominaga showed gender fluid collections.

The day marked a NYFW debut for the Tokyo, Japan-based Wataru Tominaga, Los Angeles-based brand Stan and New York City-based brands Future Lovers of Tomorrow, and Teddy Vonranson.Badgley Mischka Pulling on our collective yearning for an exotic vacation, Badgley Mischka's spring 2021 collection took inspiration from places both far and fantastical -- from the Grecian isles and Havana, Cuba to the ruins of Mexico and the Garden of Good and Evil, the brand said. 

""Colors are drawn from classic Greek villas and their vistas, the Cuban flag, and the fabulous gardens throughout America from Long Island to Georgia. The fabrics are modern versions of the timeless, luxurious textiles that we love – mikado, doubleweight and satin crepes, lace, tulle, georgette. We wanted a glamourous but easy spa feel for our clothes, and developed a super lightweight sequined terrycloth that we love.""

Glorious gowns reigned supreme in luxe crimson, sequined gold, bright fuchsia and vibrant blue, fit for a seaside Greek getaway, alongside a hassled caftan, paisley and floral top and pant set, and black coat dress. 

""We were leaning toward a Cole Porter, lounge-y vibe with the collection, with Jean Harlow in “Dinner at Eight” as our particular hero this season,"" the brand said. ""These are clothes meant to comfort us while we are at home, and to celebrate when we can.""BevzaUkrainian brand Bevza paid homage to its cultural roots for its spring/summer 2021 collection, presented in a film entitled 'Tryp'. Inspired by Trypillia, an ancient Ukrainian culture famous for its pottery, the collection ""encompasses some of the most ancient and fascinating aspects of Ukrainian history while exploring the powerful sanctity of women,"" the brand said. 

Complementing the pottery's organic, simple beauty, the collection's slinky dresses, wide-legged pants, knit cardigans and linen jackets are natural, elegant and soft, featured in a color palette of black, white, cream, pale yellow, dusty pink and pale mint.

“I wanted to show how important it is to find our roots and make it interesting. This pandemic separated us from other nations and cultures,” said designer Svitlana Bevza. “We can communicate our customs to each other by telling a story of our own land.""AknvasShowing on Runway360, Aknvas -- the brand founded by Dior, Raf Simons and John Galliano alumni, Christian Juul Nielsen -- presented a full spring 2021 collection of womenswear, as well as the brand's premiere menswear collection.

Alive with brightly colored parkas, jumpsuits and striped button-down shirts for men and trenches, shirt dresses, ruched tops, pants and shorts for women, both collections were inspired by Nielsen's vibrant travels throughout the Caribbean, wrapping up tropical optimism in clean Scandinavian cuts. Oak & Acorn ~ Only for the RebellesMiko Underwood's brand Oak & Acorn - Only for the Rebelles, which claims the title of first sustainable denim heritage brand made in Harlem, New York, presented a film focused on the role of Black Americans in the legacy of denim to celebrate its 2021 'seasonless' collection.

Entitled 'Red White and Indigo, the untold story of American denim,' the film is split into multiple chapters of history from the slave era to the modern labor and civil rights movements, showing a gender-diverse cast of models in a range of indigo, black, grey and white denim pieces.

The collection's pieces are made with handwoven and hand-dyed indigo West African cotton, deadstock denim, hemp and recycled cotton fibers, and all pieces are compostable, biodegradable, repurposed and incorporate antiviral and antimicrobial technology. 

""Our goal is to create pieces that unify. Clothing that is cozy, comfortable, functional, protective, empowering and eco friendly for men & women alike,"" the brand said. ""The collection prioritizes the future of sustainability, function & purpose.""

""America has a unique opportunity to have a diverse conversation. There is a mass uncovering that is allowing us to engage, examine and re-educate our history and the systems that have been imbalanced for centuries. The kinetic energy is ignited by the global pandemic, America's upcoming presidential election and the global call-to-action to value the lives and contributions of Black people."" Kenneth NicholsonHouston, Texas native Kenneth Nicholson chose a stirring short film, 'Grasp,' to exhibit his namesake label's convention-breaking menswear and further challenge the narrative of masculinity. 

Directed by Nicholson and Stefan Colson, the film follows the central character, David -- played by Dorion Wordlow -- as he ""interacts with and observes the world around him,"" the brand said, opening with David reliving a childhood memory of church in a dream.  

Amidst subsequent scenes of dance, dessert, a house party and a singular scene of raw distress, actors glide across screen in Nicholson's clothing: colorful floral button-downs, polka dotted suits, a billowing sage set, a structured, dusty blue shirt with a lace bib, a tight, purple plaid pant. In the final minutes of the film, David pins a large, yellow rose to the jacket of a young Black boy before returning to the church of his dream in a thick floral mantel. 

Tomorrow, the second-to-last day of the CFDA schedule will include presentations from Rebecca Minkoff, Cinq á Sept, MaxHosa Africa, Anne Klein and Kim Shui.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 15, 2020","When many women finally get their wish post-Covid to spend half their lives in the charm of the countryside with all sorts of witty and stylish pals, Anna Sui’s latest collection is what many of them will, and should, be wearing. 
In a moment that cries out for a little escapism, Sui presented a collection of imaginative insouciance that just felt perfect for this season. Her spring-summer 2021 collection was the first major one shown online Tuesday morning, the third day of the three-and-a-quarter-day-long New York season. And, quite frankly, it looks set to be one of the best all week, Sui artfully channelling her usual wit and whimsey into some highly flattering and playful clothes. A collection that one could wear Urbe et Orbi, as they say in Rome.
 
Everything worked from the opening look – a see-though black crepe nightie dress worn by blond Asian beauty Soo Joo Park, followed by a half-dozen great romantic ensembles. Sui kept the mood light, with summer frocks worn with contrasting blouses and socks all done in varied prairie flower prints, completed by matching masks.  Happily, there was not a pair of track-pants in sight, even if the cast of four wore the practical footwear of the moment – rubber-soled sandals with fabric trim.
 
Best of all, Sui cut forgivingly but never frumpily: the clothes all looked like they managed to hide any less-than-perfect torso, yet flatter the finest of figures. All accessorized with DIY vigour, from hats made of crochet and repurposed water bottles to dead-stock handbags. 
“Suddenly spending so much time at home, I was inspired by how people adjusted their lifestyles and started learning new crafts or projects to pass the time. And I realized that creating something new out of something old was really what Anna Sui was all about,” explained the designer in a program note.Staged before a beautiful painting of a gingerbread house, the sort Masha and the Bear would have lived in if they had ever made it to upstate New York. Edward Hopper post-pandemic courtesy of Oliphant Studio. Even the shortbread pie enjoyed by cast was cut with a paisley filigree seen in several outfits.
 
For the blushing bridesmaid finale at a New England posh-hippie nuptials, models Sara Grace Wallerstedt, Jordan Daniels and Sasha Knysh all looked rather divine in their gathered and perforated white dresses, Pat McGrath working her magic with naïve petals covering the cast’s faces.
 
While in New York, Anna Sui is an iconic fashion figure, too often folks back on the Continent and visiting European editors to America tend to overlook Sui. She is, however, a rather special designer whose video and online lookbook imagined a graceful and kinder world, when happier days will return to our troubled planet.

"Sep 15, 2020","Chanel has revealed plans to stage its next Métiers d’art show in historic Château de Chenonceau, the romantic Loire valley castle known as the Château des Dames. 
The Métiers d’art show, to be staged on December 1, traditionally marks the end of the annual calendar of runway shows, and is celebrated for its exuberant style and brilliant technical finish.

Chanel first began staging Métiers d’art shows back in 2002, to highlight the unique skills of a rare collection of artisan houses with the group, specialists in embroidery, millenary, pearls, boot-making, feather and other generally specialist skills. At its heart is French savoir-faire has – resources like Maison Michel for hats; Causse Gantier for gloves; boots by Massaro; costume jewelry by Goossens and Lemarié for feathers and flowers.It has grown to become a truly unique, out of season collection developed by Chanel – into a major fashion statement, which incorporates elements of haute couture and ready-to-wear.

Since its debut almost two decades ago, the house has staged audacious shows in such far flung locations as Rome, Salzburg, Bombay, and New York. Under former artistic director Karl Lagerfeld the Métiers d’art  shows toured the planet, making stops in 2009 on the Bund in Shanghai, and in 2012 in Edinburgh’s ruined Linlithgow Castle, the ancient home of the Kings of Scotland.

"Sep 14, 2020","New York Fashion Week opened Sunday evening with an actual live show on a downtown roof top staged by with real character by Jason Wu, albeit devoid of any obvious audience. 
The designer certainly made an effort with a handsome tropical setting, carting in over 1,000 trees and 12,000 pounds of fine white sand on to the roof of Spring Studios, a key professional show space in downtown Tribeca frequently used by American designers.
 
“I was inspired by my home away from home, Tulum. I wanted to create a collection that reminds me of the bright, tropical hues that recall so many memories,” said Wu, referencing the historic Mexican resort.
 
It was impossible to notice anyone in the audience; as the models marched through the palms, alocasia and banana trees. With The Jenga Building and the Freedom Tower forming a dramatic backdrop, this was an accomplished entry into the New York collections.  The beginning of a uniquely low-key season of 24 days of shows that will finish in Paris on the evening of Tuesday, October 6 with Louis Vuitton.
 
The actual collection captured the current yearning for looser silhouettes, forgiving clothes and need for optimism during the pandemic. Entitled Paradise in the City, its Caribbean coastline inspiration was evident throughout. Wu’s e-invitation was an airmail with an illustration of a runway chair under a palm tree on a beach; his stamp read Forever Jason Wu.Using a cast of some 25 models, Wu showed a very much after-hours summery selection that opened with crème caramel linen perforated dresses; pant and tunic ensembles in cricket stripes; feminine picnic dresses; and some very cool print frocks vertically divided into contrasting natural or graphic prints. Everything worn with flats, from chunky tire track sandals, to river running athletic looks finished with pearls.

All cut with real aplomb – from the flared dresses with straps or flouncy cotton skirts; to the culottes in pacific blue or the excellent putty-hued gathered cocktails which had real authority. A couple of stylistic tricks – courtesy of Ludivine Poiblanc - whether wearing bras outside the print cocktails, or finishing the looks with big straw hots or sou-westers adding a nice touch of nonchalance.

Wind-blown, with the sense of balmy days of summer, and worn by a largely American cast of models, even if finished off by quirky Belgian catwalker Hanae Gaby Odiele.
 
Many of the biggest shows in Manhattan will take place on the roof of Spring Studios, which also provided a show compere and TV host – respectively Lilliana Vazquez and Zanna Roberts Rassi, well-known fashion E! News fashion enthusiasts.The latter interviewed Wu, a veteran restaurant junkie, in a 15-minute rambling discussion about keeping an Instagram food journal, and making over 200 meals, from paella to focaccia; to how he managed to organized fittings during Covid.
 
“We are New Yorkers and we are tough, and we stick together in this crazy situation. I moved here over 20 years ago to New York, a city I love. I spent my entire life before New York trying to move here. I never wanted to show anywhere else,” explained Jason, dressed in all black, with matching a black GMHC mask.
 
During the lockdown he worked closely with the Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) on their Distance Yourself from Hate campaign; raising money via mask sales. Wu also stressed that all the trees on the roof will be recycled via A Visconti Garden Center, Brooklyn’s biggest plant purveyor.
 
Though his NYC studio closed during lockdown Wu continued working with his team in China, to produce two resort collections this year; and pulled off tons of zoom casting to make this show happen.
 
“What I wanted to see for seven and a half minutes, which is how long our shows last, was four months of our hard work, so people could forget we have all these problems and escape to Tulum, where I got married,” concluded the designer.

"Sep 12, 2020","Saint Laurent hasn't pulled any punches with its latest breath-taking film. The Kering-owned luxury house, which announced that it was stepping away from the official Paris Fashion Week calendar in April, went all digital for the presentation of its menswear collection for Spring/Summer 2021, designed by creative director Anthony Vaccarello. On 9 September, the label released an online video with spectacular special effects, featuring models leaping across the rooftops of Paris in a breathlessly acrobatic race through the city.Bathed in the last rays of the setting sun, with their long hair blowing in the wind, acrobat-models sport slim suits and light, flowing overcoats as they spring across some of the French capital's most beautiful monuments. Furthermore, not content with Paris, they even take a run at the Great Wall of China and New York's Brooklyn Bridge.

The models begin their journey in Montmartre, on the domes of the Sacré-Cœur, before setting out on a frenetic rooftop race, punctuated by perilous slides and leaps of faith. Entitled ""No Matter How Long the Night is"", the six-minute short film is based on an idea from Vaccarello. It was shot by Nathalie Canguilhem and features a heady soundtrack from electro musician Sebastian, two regular Saint Laurent collaborators. From lampposts and the courtyard of the Palais-Royal to the golden dome of the Hôtel des Invalides and Trocadéro, Saint Laurent's gang of daredevil models dance across Paris with a disconcerting agility. They run in a mix of 60s rocker looks and cool, laid-back ensembles featuring Hawaiian shirts and palm tree-print jackets, before pausing for breath in front of the immense golden Art Nouveau gates at the entrance of the Petit Palais.

From there it's only a matter of crossing the street in order to attempt an ascent of the Grand Palais. Suddenly, one of the acrobats breaks through the structure's giant glass roof, which shatters spectacularly, and takes a vertiginous dive into nothingness. 
 And then the models are off again, running in a never-ending game of catch, where brand ambassador Charlotte Gainsbourg puts in a surprise appearance, albeit only for a matter of seconds. 

Finally, there is the inevitable assault on the Eiffel Tower, which lights up suddenly in the night. A transparent glass runway is suspended alongside the Parisian icon, and it is here that the last part of this unexpected runway show, which subtly mixes reality with special effects, takes place. 

Thanks to technology, Saint Laurent has created an impossible runway show, giving free rein to the magic of fashion and digital innovation. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 11, 2020","While the next fashion weeks in London and New York will be mostly digital affairs, the Milan Fashion Week is set to be the first major fashion event this autumn, making it possible to see a number of collections showing on actual catwalks. To mark the occasion, the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) has planned a very busy, varied programme.No fewer than 64 catwalk shows - 23 of them physical events, 41 virtual ones – are on the calendar of this fashion week dedicated to the womenswear and menswear collections for the Spring/Summer 2021, scheduled from September 22 to 28. But, as CNMI President Carlo Capasa said in an online news conference, “it's worth emphasising that our website will be constantly operational, showing [all the fashion week’s] physical and virtual events, 159 of them in total.”

In addition to the catwalk shows, there will be 61 presentations, 37 physical and 24 digital ones, as well as 12 invitation-only presentations and 22 special events, 13 of them physical and 9 virtual. Of course, existing health protection measures will be strictly observed at all events. Capasa indicated that a comprehensive document detailing the regulations to be complied with will be sent to fashion labels, buyers and the media.Despite the much-publicised absence of Gucci, which decided to give this edition a miss, the Milan Fashion Week calendar is packed with highlights. The first will be the Valentino show on Sunday 27, marking the Italian luxury label’s return to Milan, after showing in Paris for many years.

Dolce & Gabbana too is back - for the first time in 20 years - on Milan’s official womenswear calendar, on the first day of shows, Wednesday 23. On the same day, Blumarine will be making a much-anticipated return, after skipping the February edition. The Italian label, which has been bought by Liu Jo, will unveil for the occasion the first collection designed by Nicola Brognano, its new creative director.

Among other names that are back on the Milan womenswear calendar, Francesca Liberatore with a catwalk show, and Shuting Qiu, Emilio Pucci, Elisabetta Franchi and Andrea Pompilio with virtual events.Some shows will be staged behind closed doors, like Giorgio Armani’s on the evening of Saturday 26, to be broadcast live on TV for the first time, on Italian channel La7, at 9.15 pm CET. Prada has announced it will live-stream its show on the web, on Thursday 24.

Other leading labels will stage traditional catwalk shows again, notably Fendi, Alberta Ferretti with an outdoors show, and N°21, all on September 23. On September 24, it will be the turn of Max Mara and Etro, while Boss and Versace will show the following day, and Philosophy and Salvatore Ferragamo on September 26.

Five new names will debut on the Milan Fashion Week show calendar: Redemption, Sindiso Khumalo, MM6 Maison Margiela and Ji Won Choi, all presenting their collections virtually, as well as shi.RT by Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, which will instead stage a physical show.

CNMI is also organising a plethora of parallel projects, chiefly in support of emerging designers - by showcasing for example the work of a selection of them in the shop windows of department store La Rinascente - as well as of emerging names who are struggling and also young stylists from outside Italy.

Among others, an initiative in aid of Lebanon, following the disastrous explosion in Beirut in August, called ‘Spotlight on Lebanese Designers - CNMI in support of the new generation of Lebanese Talent’, enabling seven designers from Lebanon to take part in the Milan Fashion Week with digital presentations. They are Azzi & Osta, Boyfriend the Brand, Emergency Room, Hussein Bazaza, L’Atelier Nawbar and Roni Helou.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Sep 11, 2020","Wrangler is aiming to create a new jean that celebrates the benefits of regeneratively grown cotton, the brand announced on Thursday.Via the Jeans Redesign Project from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), the denim brand said it is looking to team up with cotton farmers, who can demonstrate and document soil-carbon and biodiversity improvements.

The selected cotton will be used to create the Wrangler 'Retro Premium Regenerative Jean' collection.The Jeans Redesign Project sees over 50 brands embrace the principles of circular economy to ensure positive impacts for the environment, society and the health of those working in its industry. As defined by the EMF, one of the key principles of circular economy is the regeneration of natural systems.

“A circular economy is symbiotic with regenerative agricultural practices,” explained Roian Atwood, senior director, global sustainable business at Wrangler, in a news statement.

“Wrangler is amplifying our commitment with this call to action as we work with farmers to rapidly scale the supply of sustainably-grown cotton. For this project, we’re looking for the best of the best.”

To be considered, farmers worldwide have been asked to submit documented evidence of improved soil health and environmental benefits resulting from their adoption of regenerative agricultural systems. Examples include improvements in soil carbon, soil physical properties, biological properties, and determined benefits to the environment.

In addition to signing onto the Jeans Redesign guidelines, the brand joined EMF’s Make Fashion Circular, which drives collaboration between apparel industry leaders to ensure clothes are made from safe and renewable materials, new business models increase their use, and old clothes are turned into new.

The Kontoor Brands-owned brand made its first commitment to sustainable cotton in 2017, with the launch of the Wrangler Science and Conservation Program. The program aims to build a more resilient and regenerative cotton supply.

Wrangler equally previously announced its aim to source 100 percent of its cotton from farms using land stewardship practices by 2025.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 10, 2020","Decker Brands subsidiary Ugg has announced its role as a sponsor of the opening weekend of the Hammer Museum's Made in L.A. 2020, presented in partnership with The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens. Now making its fifth return, the event will open in the fall of 2020 and run through the end of the year, showcasing new installations, videos, films, sculptures, performances and paintings from 30 Los Angeles-based emerging artists.

As a sponsor, Ugg will promote two Made in L.A. 2020 artists, Fulton Leroy Washington, or ""Mr. Wash,"" and Sonya Sombreuil in the work ""Feel ____,"" a film series that spotlights California artists ""who tell personal stories about their lives, their work and what fuels their creativity,"" the footwear and lifestyle brand said. The film featuring Mr. Wash takes place inside his home apartment and art studio in Compton, California, and tells the story of how he took up drawing, painting and creative storytelling while serving twenty-one years in jail for a nonviolent drug offense in the late 1990s. Originally given a life sentence, Wash had his sentence commuted and was granted clemency by President Barack Obama in 2016.

In the Ugg film, viewers learn about Wash's first subjects--his fellow inmates--and get a sneak peak of one of his Made in L.A. 2020 paintings, an homage to Kobe Bryant.

Sombreuil's film celebrates her fashion label, Come Tees, and her signature graphic screen-printed pieces influenced by her California upbringing and relationship to Los Angeles streetwear culture. 

""My whole aesthetic is very located in an origin story, being surrounded by books and records,"" said Sombrueil. ""I think that so much of my art is about locating that feeling.""

Sombrueil's work at the Hammer features paintings that function as walls for a kind of imagined space that acts as a gallery, venue, and gathering place, and are a historical recreation of spaces that she's been through in her origin as an artist, Ugg said. 

""We are really proud to partner with the Hammer, one of the foremost museums in the country known for their belief that art and ideas illuminate our lives and build a more just world,"" said Andrea O'Donnell, president, fashion lifestyle with Deckers Brands.

Both films were shot by Kauai Moliterno and Michael Barth, with stills being captured by Neil Favila with support from Production LA.  In the films, both artists wear Ugg footwear--Wash in the Ugg Neumel chukka and Sombreuil in the new Classic Ultra Mini.

To further boost the partnership, Ugg will unveil two limited-edition t-shirts featuring the Made in L.A. 2020 works of Mr. Wash and Sombreuil, which will become available when the exhibition opens at the Hammer gift shop and ugg.com. For each purchase, a donation will be made to the Equal Justice Initiative.

The brand said it will continue to pull the Feel campaign into future seasons.

""Feel ____ with Mr. Wash and Sonya Sombreuil will be followed by 'Feel You.' in mid-September, as an unapologetic celebration of individuality and style featuring a multitude of artists, creatives, designers, and activists from around the globe,"" Ugg said.

"Sep 10, 2020","Kerby Jean-Raymond and Kering have announced the creation of Your Friends in New York, a novel new platform designed to empower a next generation of innovators.Your Friends in New York plans to merge fashion, music, art, philanthropy and wellness “to form an eco-system of creativity that reimagines how consumers discover and interact with brands, including Jean-Raymond’s own brand, Pyer Moss,” the New York designer and the giant French luxury group explained in a release Thursday.

The concept was dreamed up by Jean-Raymond, and set in motion after a meeting with François-Henri Pinault, Chairman and CEO of Kering, in 2019. Your Friends in New York had been scheduled to launch in March 2020, but delayed its birth due to the global pandemic.“It is important to me to create and work on ventures that are future forward, involve the community at large and that will continue to help others grow in the fashion and art space,” explained Kerby Jean-Raymond, the single most exciting new designer to have emerged in the New York in the past few years.

Your Friends in New York, or YFINY, will consist of multiple divisions including an event and experiences arm, an incubator inspired program, philanthropic initiatives, and a merchandise label, expressing the wide ranging interests of Jean-Raymond, a Haitian-American who won the 2018 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award.

“When I met Kerby in 2019, I was impressed by his unique perspective of creativity, innovation, business and social issues. What struck me immediately was his willingness to invent a new, singular model, freeing himself from the usual constraints of the fashion system. It was only natural for Kering to support this project that seeks to empower new artistic talents, to encourage the diversity of creativity and to give a voice to the younger generation of innovators,” added François-Henri Pinault.

Your Friends in New York first mobilized in March 2020 with a personal donation from Jean-Raymond as part of the organization’s mission to aid marginalized communities impacted by the pandemic. Kering aided YFINY’S COVID-19 relief efforts with a supporting donation.

Moving forward, Your Friends in New York will also  focus on supporting local communities, by providing mental health services for children and residents of public housing.  This new platform will also serve as the next evolution of Pyer Moss fashion show.

"Sep 10, 2020","Courrèges has announced the appointment of Nicolas Di Felice as the house’s new Artistic Director, effective today. 
“I’ve always dreamed of Courrèges, of its total and enveloping universe. It’s a house that means a lot to me and in which I recognize myself. Its simplicity, its clarity, but also its optimism: I am honored to continue to keep alive these values with, I hope, just as much passion and enthusiasm as the founder,” said Di Felice in a release.
 
Of Belgian origin, 37-year-old Di Felice studied at the noted fashion school of Brussels, La Cambre, before then working for Balenciaga, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.The appointment comes four months after the house named Adrien Da Maia to be its new president. 
 
“The nomination of Nicolas as artistic director marks a great day in the history of Courrèges. His vision for the brand, clear and modern, links perfectly with the timeless values of the house,” said Da Maia. 
 
Di Felice succeeds Yolanda Zobel, who was only named artistic director in 2018; she followed the design duo of Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant, the founders of Indie label Coperni, who were dismissed after a three-year stint in 2018.
 
The father of French Space Age minimalism, Courrèges is noted for its signature futuristic style and obsession with white. Despite multiple recent travails, it remains an iconic French marque and one with real hidden potential, so Di Felice debut – in March 2021 – will be closely watched.
 
Founded in 1961 by André and Coqueline Courrèges, the house was acquired in end 2017 by Artemis, the key investment arm of the Pinault family. The Pinaults control Kering, the world’s second largest luxury group, which includes such stellar marques as Saint Laurent, Gucci, Alexandre McQueen and Bottega Veneta.

"Sep 7, 2020","France is becoming a risky destination, given the renewed spread of Covid-19 cases in the country since the summer, and the marked rise in the infection rate in recent days. A delicate situation also affecting the Paris Fashion Week dedicated to the Spring/Summer 2021 womenswear collections, scheduled from September 28 to October 6. Many buyers, distributors and other industry professionals have decided to stay away from the French capital.
 It is no surprise that the coming fashion season is turning out to be unlike any other. The virus is still rampant, restrictive health-protection measures and limitations to travel are in place, meaning that September isn't going to bring the eagerly awaited return to normality. Fashion weeks are suffering as a result, especially in Paris, which is increasingly looking like an infection-ridden city. Visitors are threatening to shun the French capital, and many events usually held during the Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled or moved elsewhere.

The Valentino catwalk show for example, which will be exceptionally held in Milan on September 27. The Italian luxury label's new CEO, Jacopo Venturini, has explained the decision in a press release: “In the current situation, we must anticipate decisions to protect our main resources, in other words our staff, and to explore new opportunities to enable the brand to remain relevant.  This is why we believe it is more appropriate to stage the next show in Italy, in Milan.”It is an established fact that a number of international buyers won’t be travelling to Paris, especially those from the UK and the USA, who fear having to quarantine once they return home. The same is true for those from Asia and some European countries.

François Delahaye, boss of Parisian luxury hotels Le Meurice and Plaza Athénée, has confirmed this is the case. Luxury giant LVMH, which “usually books 1,250 nights” for the Paris Fashion Week, “cut the number to 250, because they used to invite American and Chinese guests, who won’t be leaving their countries because of the quarantine,” he told the AFP agency.

Luxury labels are paring inter-country travel down to the bone. “Our local staff will be in charge of running the shows. Inviting celebrities and looking after travel arrangements is out of the question,” a source from a major label told FashionNetwork.com.

The majority of Italian distributors will also be giving the Paris Fashion Week a miss, as some of them told industry website MF Fashion last Tuesday. “Our office on the Champs Elysées remains closed. We will stay in Milan to avoid unnecessary risks, and also a likely quarantine, a prospect that has been floated insistently in the last few days,” said the owner of the Studio Zeta showroom, Mauro Callegari, speaking to MF Fashion.

“We won’t travel to Paris because, apart from a few European buyers, no one will go there. And Paris is prohibitively expensive,” said Riccardo Grassi, of the eponymous showroom. “We had everything set up to showcase 15 collections at our Paris offices, but our clients themselves are now telling us they won’t go to Paris, to avoid taking risks,” Daniele Ghiselli told MF Fashion. Other distributors are still waiting before taking a final decision.

A similar stance has been adopted in the UK. This season, the British Fashion Council will not present its customary selection of emerging designers in Paris, as a spokesperson told FashionNetwork.com: “Owing to the ongoing situation, we won’t be organising the London Show Rooms in Paris this season. We are holding talks about switching the concept to a digital format, but this hasn't been fully confirmed yet.”

International showrooms that are still planning to stage sales campaigns during the Paris Fashion Week will do so in a less emphatic way. “We will be open during the Paris Fashion Week, but on a smaller scale, and most meetings with buyers will take place virtually,” said Anthony Flamos, managing director of AMF Showroom, talking to FashionNetwork.com.

“We will be open from September 30 to October 7, operating in a hybrid fashion, with stricter rules for in-person meetings in terms of number of guests, and also offering online appointments,” said Jacob Valdemar, founder of Vald Agency, specialised in Scandinavian designer labels.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 7, 2020","080 Barcelona Fashion is gearing up to host its first ever fully digital edition. After postponing the event due to the coronavirus crisis, the Spanish showcase will run from 14-17 September with a line-up of 21 designers and brands. Following in the footsteps of other international fashion weeks, the digital edition of 080 Barcelona Fashion will aim to “take advantage of digital formats to attempt to bring fashion to all audiences while opening the event to an increasingly international public”. So the 080 TV website will serve as a digital hub, hosting a series of digital activations from virtual front rows to ‘Designers DNA’ broadcasts, capturing the essence of various fashion brands through short documentary films. Runway shows will be streamed live from the Sant Pau Art Nouveau architectural complex.
 
This season’s schedule includes the likes of Oscarleon, Txell Miras, Menchén Tomás, Brain & Beast and tailoring phenomenon Mans, as well as Catalan brands including Naulover, Yerse, Sita Murt, Maite by Lola Casademunt, Lebor Gabala, Guillermina Baeza and industry heavyweight Custo Barcelona. Emerging designers are also joining the showcase with confirmed names such as Eñaut, Guillem Rodriguez, The Label Edition, All That She Loves, Lera Mamba, Eiko Ai. Úlia G. Escribà and Onrushw23fh will present at 080 Barcelona Fashion for the first time. International ambitions

“This edition of 080 continues its commitment to technology, sustainability and the circular economy. The aim of the platform is to promote Catalan fashion and design on an international level. In this sense, digitalisation can be seen as an opportunity to increase the projection of Catalan fashion while reaching new international audiences,” the organisers said about the event. Continuing with the ‘Undress your mind’ theme, the showcase cements its position as an open, multidisciplinary platform with an international focus, reflecting its commitment to sustainability, creativity and innovation. 

Other highlights will include a programme of fashion, business and tech talks led by industry experts, as well as a Behind the Scenes section providing never-before-seen footage from previous editions and exclusive behind-the-scenes content. 

080 Barcelona Fashion Showroom is also going digital, using new technology to bring together fashion agencies, buyers from international fashion chains and local brands like Escorpion, Simorra and Munich. The exclusive community will be active from 10-23 October and is expected to draw thousands of buyers. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 6, 2020","Paris Fashion Week has unveiled the schedule for the city’s next runway season, with a healthy 88 events listed on the official program.
 
The nine-day season, showing Spring-Summer 2021 women’s ready-to-wear, debuts on Monday, September 28, with Japanese rising star Mame Kurogouchi. It ends on Tuesday, October 6, with Louis Vuitton.
 
It remains to be fully clarified, however, exactly how many houses will in the end stage actual physical runway shows, rather than just presentations in showrooms.
 
The Federation de la Haute Couture, French fashion’s governing body, cautioned in a note: “This Official Calendar brings together the houses of fashion shows calendar and the houses of presentations calendar and will include physical and/or digital events.” 
 
Asterisks on the calendar indicate that, currently, 22 houses plan presentations— and not catwalk events. 
 
That said, major fashion houses such as Christian Dior, Chanel and Louis Vuitton have all confirmed their goal: to stage proper physical shows. Though, due to social distancing, these will have significantly smaller audiences than usual.
 
Unlike New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo has imposed a maximum audience size of 50 people for the city’s upcoming Fashion Week, authorities here have issued no specific instructions on fashion crowd sizes in Paris. 
 France has suffered a significant spike in the number of people testing positive to Covid-19 in the past several weeks; with more than a score of clusters being reported in Paris alone. On Friday, Sept. 4, the health ministry reported seven new deaths from coronavirus in the capital. Wearing a mask is now effectively compulsory throughout Paris— or one risks facing a 135-euro fine.
 
Several notable fashion houses – in particular Saint Laurent and Comme des Garçons – are going to sit out this season, but by and large, the vast majority of brands have recommitted to the season. A far higher percentage comparatively than New York, where such leading brands as Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Tommy Hilfiger will not be present this month.As noted, the Federation accepted 10 new entrants onto the calendar last week, underlining Paris’ continuing attraction as the pre-eminent season, even in the midst of the global pandemic. The opening Monday features four of these fledgling houses, including Situationist from Georgia and Wales Bonner, the fashion-forward London tailor who was the LVMH Prize winner of 2016.
 
Tuesday afternoon kicks off with the first show by a mega brand, Dior, at its traditional time slot of 2.30pm, while the day will finish with another LVMH Prize winner, Thebe Magugu of South Africa.
 
Shows are scheduled most hours from 9.30 AM to 8PM, in a season which will witness the debut of new hire Matthew Williams as creative director of Givenchy. Expect a major shift in direction from his predecessor Clare Waight Keller, who designed Meghan Markle’s bridal gown, to Williams, who helped create the LED jacket Kanye West wore for his Grammy 2008 performance, and prior to his role at Givenchy was a creative consultant to Lady Gaga. 
Among other new arrivals to the Paris calendar will be Gabriela Hearst, the Uruguayan-born, New York-based designer, and Mossi, the happening haute street label.
 
The season will finish with a busy Tuesday, where giants like Chanel, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton are showing. The latter two bracket Maison Margiela, which has pushed back the date of its show— making for a charged final few hours.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Sep 4, 2020","London Fashion Week has revealed its catwalk schedule for the upcoming season, and can boast over 30 actual physical events. Plus, as many as 50 brands who will make digital only activations. 
The announcement should help put paid to naysayers and prophets of doom predicting the demise of international catwalk seasons and their replacement by Internet-driven displays. Multiple designers in the UK clearly feel that buyers and editors need to clothes live in order to understand and appreciate them.
 
All told, 32 houses will stage actual live events in this month’s LFW, due to run from Thursday 17th to Tuesday 22nd September 2020 - all adhering to government guidelines on social distancing. Though the season begins with a purely digital display, Britain’s biggest luxury brand Burberry on the opening Thursday. Roksanda and Pronounce will finish the live physical season mid-afternoon on the Tuesday.
 
All told, there are “21 physical and digital shows; seven physical only and three designers who will activate through a physical evening event only,” the BFC said in an official release.
 
Friday the 18th will be the busiest day with physical shows by the likes of Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, Margaret Howell, Mark Fast and Temperley London. 
Victoria Beckham is organizing a salon presentation; while Simone Rocha, Sharon Wauchob and Christopher Kane plan to present by appointment. Many designers plan to unveil films – J.W. Anderson, Bora Aksu, Phoebe English, Osman, Liam Hodges, Molly Godard and Stephen Jones, among others.
 
“LFW is one of the few international events to still be going ahead in London, proving the industry’s resilience, creativity, and innovation in difficult times. Now more than ever, the BFC acknowledges the necessity to look at the future of LFW and the opportunity to drive change, collaborate and innovate in ways that will establish long-term benefits, develop new sustainable business models and boost the industry’s economic and social power,” the BFC added.
 
Like its debut digital season in June, this latest LFW will be a gender neutral showcase, albeit primarily with women’s designers.
 
“The British Fashion Industry faces enormous challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 and the BFC keeps on calling on Government to support a sector which in 2019 contributed £35 billion to the UK economy and employs over 890,000 people,” the organization concluded.

"Sep 4, 2020","Comme des Garçons and its related designer team have pulled out of the upcoming Paris Fashion week, in a major loss to the catwalk calendar.
 
“Comme des Garçons, Junya Watanabe and Noir Kei Ninomiya will not be showing in Paris for the SS21 season,” the houses revealed in a sudden announcement on Friday. 
“These collections will be unveiled during mini shows or presentations in Tokyo beginning Oct 19th to 23rd as part of our seasonal showroom there. The new season of Comme des Garçons will be available for viewing as well,” the release read.
 
The move marks the first time the legendary Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, founder of Comme des Garçons and driving force behind uber hip boutique chain Dover Street Market, has not presented on the French women’s ready-to-wear calendar in four decades.The 77-year-old Kawakubo first began showing in Paris in the later 1980s, quickly establishing herself as a major creative player noted for her asymmetrical silhouettes; conceptual zest and huge all-around influence. Very much the designers’ designer, Kawakubo is only the second living designer to be honored by a solo exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum. 
 
While her protégé Junya Watanabe is a cult designer, with a unique following won thanks to his highly experimental fashion, and innovative fabrics and fabrications. While rising star Kei Ninomiya, a former assistant of Kawakubo, is best known for his unconventional designers and artisanal construction.
 
Their joint decision to skip the next Paris season – scheduled from Monday, September 28 to Tuesday, October 6 – is a highly significant depletion in the official calendar.

"Sep 4, 2020","Nostalgia for a more innocent era, and one where Italy was emerging from another great drama, was the theme of Dolce & Gabbana’s Alta Moda show in Florence Thursday night, the first women’s fashion collection by a major house shown on the planet since lockdown this spring. 
Specifically, a certain wistfulness for an event in Florence in 1951, when entrepreneur Giovanni Battista Giorgini staged the First Italian High Fashion Season in his private villa. Marking the first ever women’s ready-to-wear season in Europe; the initial spark in the development of the Italian fashion industry, and indeed the reemergence of the nation from the darkness of World War II.
 
Domenico Dolce & Stefano Gabbana named this collection Rinascita, in English rebirth, in deliberate juxtaposition to Renaissance, their title for the previous evening’s bespoke menswear collection, staged in Florence’s city hall.Back in Feb 1951, that first tiny “season” featuring 10 small local fashion designers – names like Emilio Pucci, Emilio Schuberth and Sorelle Fontana – attracted just six buyers, but it was an exceptional event, which started international press and fashion magazines speaking about Italian fashion. Moreover, just as the canny Giorgini called on local crafts people to present their best ideas to the North American buyers he convinced to come to Florence, this week Milan-based Dolce & Gabbana had some three dozen companies of tiny artisans collaborate on their glamorous invasion of Florence.
 
The end result was a frequently brilliant display of sunny Italian élan and optimism, albeit made in retro silhouettes, recalling that more gentle era. 
As dusk fell over the capital of Renaissance, the first models marched down the steps of the garden of Villa Bardini, which sweeps spectacularly down the river Arno. A stunning crinoline with a marvelous illustration of the Duomo; accessorized with a multi-million-euro ruby necklace and delightful iris-shaped hat, debuted the show. Sumptuous chic throughout – from the satin ball gowns in a print of the Palazzo Vecchio topped by a jet black feather tank glistening with crystals, to the flowing A-Line silk coat done with a water-color image of the Ponte Vecchio.
 
Before Domenico and Stefano went into overdrive at the finale. A trio of gloriously golden straw dresses, bustiers and jackets recalling the early Fifties to a bird of paradise gown made of scores of canary yellow cock feathers. 
 
Post-show, guests dined al fresco on beautifully laid tables with superb silver centerpieces courtesy of Pampaloni, from designs dating back to the 16th century. A golden tinged dinner, each dish finished with edible gold leaf courtesy of Giusto Manetti, including a main course of a gilded filetto di manzo. Two of local artisans who contributed to three days of Dolce & Gabbana events, including a haute joaillerie showroom; bespoke menswear show and wine tasting in Italy’s greatest quality wine producer, Antinori. 
 “The image of fashion nowadays is very big: giant shows, huge boutiques and massive social media reach, but artisans have tiny businesses. Literally, when you visit them, their studios are very small. You are face to face with them as soon as you walk in the door!” chuckled Domenico Dolce, who visited Florence eight times this year, individually meeting each of the artisans.
 
After marching all the way to the bottom of the stairway and back up, the cast posed before an arbor of giant pink roses and crimson bougainvillea. Whether a semi-sheer lace coat finished with yellow clothe lilies and trimmed with ermine or a ravishing white tulle cocktail with tiny hand-made floral buds, the craftsmanship was impeccable.
 
The duo taking their bow to a Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland duet of Libiamo Ne’lieti Calici, and to golden fireworks display, before a backdrop of the neo-gothic Basilica of Santa Croce, where Michelangelo and Galileo are buried.
 
A final Dolce & Gabbana display from the designers, and their never-ending love song to their own country. 
 
“That’s what we do. Our métier is to create Italian fashion. And that’s what people expect when they come to see Dolce & Gabbana – Italy,” concluded Dolce.

"Sep 3, 2020","Mannerist menswear par excellence at Alta Sartoria, the couture collection of Dolce & Gabbana, presented with enormous fanfare in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence’s city hall, on Wednesday night.The show – introduced by youthful mayor Dario Nardella, who also presented actress Monica Bellucci the keys to the city – featured 100 looks and marked the first major catwalk event by an acclaimed key fashion house since the world went into Covid-19 lockdown this spring.
 
All unveiled inside the Salone dei Cinquecento, the massive soaring council chamber decorated by giant frescoes by Giorgio Vasari, the first person to use the term Renaissance in print.The show opened up with several medieval shirts finished with the red giglio, or iris, that the Medici adopted as the city’s emblem and which Florentines wore into battle, even during the First Crusade. One handsome youth marching proudly in a stunning swordsman’s version in cerulean blue and scarlet giglio made of feathers supplied by Duccio Mazzanti, a third generation Florentine feather specialist. He was one of 35 local expert artisans who contributed to this three-day series of Dolce&Gabbana events, including an opening haute joaillerie display and an alta moda show in a hilltop villa on Thursday night.Throughout Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana referenced the great icons of the Renaissance – Michelangelo, Leonardo, Ghirlandaio and Botticelli. Interpreting the humanist ideas of that epoch – where man, and not god, became the center of the universe – in some outlandishly grand outfits. Climaxing with ducal robes in mink, bullion and gold embroidery. Worthy of Cosimo de' Medici, and echoing paintings of rulers of Florence, by the likes of Salviati. Portraits of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, the greatest condottiere of the era, even appeared on gold brocade tunics.
 
In yet another bravura moment, the duo transferred an image of a warrior amid swords, spears and bugles seen in Vasari’s enormous fresco of the Battle of Marciano onto a remarkable embroidered jacquard dressing gown finished with astrakhan lapels.
 
Moreover, the rich hues of those frescoes appeared in a series of devilishly well cut suits – composed of razor sharp double breasted jackets and sleek finished at the ankle pants.
 
The whole conception could easily have tripped over into cliché, except the finish was so spectacular, the color palette so intense and the sense of celebration so memorable. In short, menswear for men of distinction that reaches the level of haute couture achieved for the world’s wealthiest women.“Thinking about it, after spending all this time here with the local artisans, I have realized that the true role of we Italians is to use ancient and new ideas create beauty for the world,” said Domenico in a pre-show press conference inside an ancient cloisters, igniting a burst of applause from the assembled group of some 100 of his co-nationals.
 
Five centuries ago, Leonardo da Vinci once attempted a novel method of drying one of his frescoes in the Salone dei Cinquecento, hanging hot coal braziers which only succeeded in melting the paint, causing the colors to run into a puddle on the floor. But everything worked extremely well in this collection. All the way to the mysterious lettering on several tuxedos, reading Cerca Trova, meaning Seek and Find, a reference to the myth that the remains of Leonardo’s damaged fresco are still hidden behind Vasari’s later work.
 
Post-show, guests were treated to a dramatic display of tamburini and sbandieratori – drummers and flag wavers in traditional costumes marching to sonorous drumming as hundreds of locals watched from the far side of the Piazza della Signoria.
 
Ironically, exactly where the austere Dominican monk Girolamo Savonarola, who briefly ruled Florence for four years, staged his bonfire of the vanities – when works of art by Botticelli and tapestries, mirrors, cosmetics and sculpture where destroyed – was executed in 1498.
 
Very certainly, Savonarola would have been appalled by the glorious excess of this Alta Sartoria collection with its supreme self-indulgence and hyper opulence. A brilliant fashion statement offering a vision of a brighter more optimistic future at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel.

"Sep 2, 2020","In April, Saint Laurent announced its intention to implement its own calendar until at least the end of 2020. Now the Kering-owned luxury house has decided to unveil its menswear collection for Spring/Summer 2021 in September, having forgone Paris Fashion Week online, organised in July to replace June's men's fashion week, which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On its Instagram account, Saint Laurent has posted a number of photos and videos to announce its menswear project by Anthony Vaccarello, which will take place as a digital performance on Wednesday, 9 September, when it will be streamed at midday.

"Sep 1, 2020","Burberry’s Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci has a new theatrical manoeuvre - creating the costumes for Marina Abramović’s latest project 7 Deaths of Maria Callas.The performance artist’s latest opera project, 7 Deaths of Maria Callas will have its world premiere this Tuesday night at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany.

Marina Abramović developed the opera with the composer Marko Nikodijević - using famous Callas scenes from Carmen, Tosca, Otello, Lucia di Lammermoor, Norma, Madame Butterfly and La Traviata, to illuminate the dramatic and tragic life of the American-born Greek soprano. For Carmen, Tisci dreamed up a red oversized crepe Toledo jacket  glistening with crystal embroidery; while for Lucia di Lammermoor Riccardo invented a pearl satin gown with floral motifs encrusted with Chantilly lace and accompanied by a floor-sweeping mask-veil.Besides directing and designing the set, Abramović will perform on stage. She also collaborated with the actor Willem Dafoe on a film created especially for the world premiere. 7 Deaths of Maria Callas will subsequently enjoy performances in Berlin, Athens and Paris.

“I am a romantic dreamer at my core, so this was a very easy project to get involved with. The subject is one of love in all its forms, from the light to the dark. Marina is one of my great personal loves and I feel privileged to call her my friend and my family,” said Tisci.

“She is one of the world’s most daring and brave artists, and it’s an incredible honor to collaborate with her once again on a subject that is so close to both of our hearts,” added the Burberry CCO.

In effect, the costume design for 7 Deaths of Maria Callas was the fruit of a collaboration between close friends Marina Abramović and Riccardo Tisci - a joint creative experience were dramatic, theatrical costumes were reinterpreted through a modern lens. To many people, Callas is the definition of a Diva, a singer so gifted that Leonard Bernstein called her “the Bible of opera.”

“I have wanted to make 7 Deaths for 30 years. To die from a broken heart is the thread which draws together each opera in a project which is centered around love and its forms, as much as my relationship with Riccardo. When the opportunity for this project started to become real, there was no other team I wanted to work with: Riccardo had to make all the costumes because we are love, he is fashion and I am art, two worlds that cross over in a creative dialogue of love, respect and freedom. I am so proud of this work as a team and grateful to Riccardo for teaching me how to be elegant and confident as a woman in my life and in my performances,” said the Serbian-born Abramović.

For opera buffs and lovers of the performance art unable to reach Munich tonight, Marina Abramović's 7 Deaths of Maria Callas will also be live streamed on Staatsoper.Tv on 5 September 2020 at 6:30pm CEST, and will be available to watch on demand for 30 days from 7 September.

In a brief statement, the Roman based house underlined that the decision was brought on by concerns about the global pandemic. As a result, Valentino Men’s and Women’s Spring/Summer 2021 collections will be presented together on September 27th, the penultimate day of the seven-day-long Milan Fashion Week.
 
“These unprecedented times we are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought the company to reconsider where to present the Valentino collection and has decided to show in Milan rather than in Paris for this season,” the house explained in a communiqué.
 
This marks the second time that Valentino has departed Paris, where it has staged its menswear, women’s ready-to-wear and haute couture collections almost exclusively for the past two decades.
 
The announcement also comes six weeks after Valentino staged its most recent couture collection behind closed doors in a collaboration with photographer Nick Knight and without any audience inside Cinecittà, the giant film studios in Rome.
 
“Paris is the city where we have always hosted our shows and that truly embodies Valentino DNA. The current situation has forced us to take an unusual decision. I believe that, in this moment in time, it is of paramount importance to stay grounded and focused and to work on tasks. I feel energized when I can work on ideas and this is the time for ideas to spread and grow. Milano is a new opportunity, a great project that I am developing with my teams with the aim of working around the idea of identity,” said the house’s Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli.
 
The dramatic change of locations is the latest upheaval in the international runway calendar in the wake of the global health crisis, which led to the cancellation of practically all catwalk shows in the Europe this summer, and to multiple brands forsaking their traditional locations this fall.

"Aug 31, 2020","There is growing uncertainty about the evolution of the renewed Covid-19 surge in Europe in September, and about the measures that will need be adopted to stem the pandemic. In other words, it will be a leap into the unknown for the many fashion shows and events which usually take place after the summer. Some of them have decided to push their dates back by a month, others are sticking to them, often helped by the deployment of digital solutions, while others have thrown in the towel. As a result, there is a great deal of pressure on the next season of events dedicated to the Spring/Summer 2021.Dolce & Gabbana will be first in the limelight, at the beginning of September, with a couture event in Florence in collaboration with Pitti Immagine. The Italian luxury label will stage two shows, the Alta sartoria menswear show at Palazzo Vecchio on September 2, and the Alta moda womenswear show at Villa Bardini on September 3. Both events will be highly exclusive, open to a limited number of guests, and aren’t expected to create any problem for Dolce & Gabbana in terms of health protection measures. Last July, the label staged a physical show for its menswear collection, and is expected to return shortly to Milan with womenswear.
 
The situation will not be the same for trade shows, which usually attract large numbers of visitors. The Parisian trade shows scheduled from September 4 to 7 - albeit in streamlined formats - at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre, have had to rethink their plans. Who's Next, Impact, Traffic and Riviera have been postponed to October 2-4, and will be held in parallel with Première Classe, already scheduled on those dates at the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris.Lingerie show Interfilière has instead opted not to hold a physical edition, and will be staged online via the Interfilière Connect website, launched on August 24 and operational until September 30. The Splash Paris show, dedicated to resortwear, has chosen a similar solution, cancelling its October edition and opting for an online format, from September 7 to October 9.

Another major trade show that will not be taking place is Première Vision, originally planned on September 15-16 at the Paris-Nord Villepinte exhibition centre. The textile sourcing event has had to cancel its physical edition due to the stringent health protection measures imposed by the French government to fight the pandemic. Première Vision Made in France, showcasing the output of French garment producers and finishers, accessories suppliers, and knitwear and fabric manufacturers, will instead go ahead as planned at the Carreau du Temple in Paris on September 1-2.

The French government's ban on major events, those attended by over 5,000 people, in place until October, spelt doom for Première Vision, which shifted suddenly to a digital-only version. The show's virtual edition is scheduled on September 15-16, and will feature, besides exhibitors’ collections, a programme of conferences and presentations, and networking opportunities for producers and buyers.
 Italian show organiser Pitti Immagine opted for the same approach, after initially postponing the summer session of its events to early September. Lack of visibility and shrinking exhibitor numbers eventually forced the organiser to abandon the plan, pinning all its hopes on the Pitti Connect website. The latter was launched on July 16, and hosts the virtual editions of Florentine fashion shows Pitti Uomo, Bimbo and Filati. It showcases the collections of some 500 exhibitors, as well as a plethora of extra content and special events.
 
Half-way through the season, Pitti Connect’s results are regarded as positive. “We’re extremely satisfied. We still have one month ahead of us, and so far we have racked up 70,000 visitors, who viewed nearly 700,000 pages in over 150,000 site visits,” said Agostino Poletto, general manager of Pitti Immagine, talking to FashionNetwork.com.

“What's most interesting is that the length of time spent by buyers on Pitti Connect has doubled compared to the previous version of our virtual show, e-Pitti. Average browsing time has increased from one to two and a half minutes, while the number of page views has risen by 30%,” added Poletto, underlining how the emphasis on browsing length and the multiplicity of content available is what distinguishes Pitti Connect from other sites.

In other countries too, health considerations continue to cause problems to event organisers. Denim supply chain show Kingpins China City Tour, scheduled across various Chinese cities on September 2-4, has for example been cancelled, again due to the pandemic and related travel restrictions.

“While several areas around the world have begun to reopen, and a good number of our factories and partners in China are slowly returning to a normal state of affairs, for many of our international visitors travelling isn’t an option right now,” said Vivian Wang, the show's general manager.
 In Germany, the International Leather Goods Fair, scheduled in Offenbach am Main, near Frankfurt, on September 5-7, has also been called off due to the renewed rise of Covid-19 cases in the region. Footwear show Gallery Shoes, planned in Düsseldorf from August 30 to September 1, has instead confirmed its dates.
 
In Switzerland, Geneva hosted until August 29 the Geneva Watch Days show, a new watch industry event, the first to be held since the cancellation of Baselworld and Watches & Wonders (formerly SIHH) in spring. Held in Geneva’s city centre, Watch Days is the brainchild of Bulgari’s CEO Jean-Christophe Babin, a compact event with only 17 exhibitors. Its streamlined format and relaxed atmosphere were a far cry from the habitual large-scale industry events.

In Italy, the majority of Milan’s September trade shows will go ahead as planned. Italy's textile and fashion industry organisations wish to broadcast a strong message for the autumn, and have gone to great lengths to stage an intense programme of events, under a common banner, #StrongerTogether. Milano Unica will open the season at the Rho-Pero exhibition centre on the outskirts of Milan, on September 8-9, hosting nearly 200 exhibitors, less than half its usual number.

Milano Unica, Italy's leading trade event for high-end textiles and fashion accessories, might well benefit from Première Vision’s cancellation. Like its French homologue, the event has deployed a robust digital counterpart, e-MilanoUnica Connect, created with the help of Pitti Immagine’s tech know-how. Milano Unica’s virtual show will only be active after the end of the physical event, from September 10, and will be operational until the next session, in February 2021.
 
On September 19-22, the Fiera Milano pavilions will host the Homi Fashion & Jewels show. In its wake, on September 20-23, they will be home to benchmark footwear show Micam, which from September 15 to November 15 will also stage a virtual version, the Micam Milano Digital Show, on a website developed and run by the NuOrder agency.

For the first time, TheOneMilano, the show dedicated to fabric, leather and fur ready-to-wear collections, will be an integral part of Micam as a ‘Special Featured by Micam’ [sic] event, presenting total looks for footwear brands. On September 22-23, the Mipel leather goods show will be staged at Fiera Milano, while avant-garde fashion show White Milano is scheduled in the southern part of the city on September 24-27, in parallel with the Milan Fashion Week.To add an extra boost to this chaotic post-vacation period, the organisers of White Milano have launched the ‘Milano loves Italy’ project, designed to bring together and synergise the efforts of the leading players within Italy's fashion system, from showrooms to trade shows to the Milan Fashion Week, as well as local authorities.

After months of virtual events, fashion industry professionals are keen to get together and to view real live products. A sentiment that is palpable in Milan, where the President of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI), Carlo Capasa, has confirmed the Milan Fashion Week will go ahead on September 22-28 in a phygital format, featuring 28 live catwalk shows.

Leading labels like Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Salvatore Ferragamo, Max Mara and Etro have heeded the call (Gucci will instead give the event a miss), joined, among others, by Tod’s, Boss, Marni, N°21, Calcaterra and Sunnei. The programme will be completed by a great deal of digital content, comprising 24 films, among them those by Missoni, Philipp Plein, Dsquared2, Marco De Vincenzo and GCDS.
 
However, the same optimistic mood isn’t currently felt in every leading fashion capital. Inter-country transportation links are still curtailed in some regions, and countries like the UK and Germany have recently introduced quarantine measures, so that business travel, for buyers and the press, is necessarily much reduced. Not to mention social distancing requirements, which are forcing labels to drastically reduce the number of guests at their shows.

The New York Fashion Week, scheduled on September 13-16 with a closing show by Tom Ford, will be mostly held online, the event's new Runway360 website hosting some 60 names. A small number of catwalk shows will take place live, like Jason Wu’s at the fashion week’s opening, but will have to comply with the strict health protection measures still in place in the pandemic-stricken state of New York.The London Fashion Week too will be held in a reduced phygital format, on September 17-22. It will feature 25 physical shows and presentations, the majority of them streamed live online too, among them Burberry, Simone Rocha, Bethany Williams, Erdem, Pronounce and Victoria Beckham, and some 40 virtual presentations broadcast on the London Fashion Week’s website, including those by Art School, Bianca Saunders, Marques'Almeida and Richard Quinn.
 
Instead, with the exception of Koché, which has announced a show at the Buttes-Chaumont park, little is currently known about the Paris Fashion Week, scheduled from September 28 to October 6. The only information dates back to the French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation’s June announcement, indicating that it will comply with the official guidelines regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, and that the event will be integrated by the Paris Fashion Week’s online tools. Most major labels however are extremely keen to return to catwalk shows.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Aug 31, 2020","It turns out there should be plenty to watch in the next Paris runway season starting in four weeks’ time, despite all the naysayers and concerns about the pandemic. On Monday, Paris Fashion Week announced it added ten new members to upcoming season, including Wales Bonner, Enfants Riches Déprimés and S.R. Studio. LA. CA., the fashion marque of fine artist Sterling Ruby, in a major statement of commitment to the French runway season. The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body, revealed that fashion houses from five countries will join the official calendar of the upcoming season, currently scheduled to take place from Monday, September 28 to Tuesday, October 6.
 
As already noted, the happening Paris brand AMI, and the Gabriela Hearst, the acclaimed Uruguayan designer based in New York will be part of the ten talents showing during Paris fashion week. 
All told, four new French names will appear on the next Paris Fashion week, featuring spring-summer 2021 women’s ready-to-wear – besides AMI there will be Ester Manas, Vejas and Mossi, the Pierre Bergé Prize winner, founded by designer Mossi Traoré. While S.R. Studio from  the United States, the fledgling fashion brand of Sterling Ruby, the fabric artist who has been a long-time collaborator with Raf Simons, brings to three the number of American-based brands joining the Fédération’s schedule. Also from LA, Enfants Riches Déprimés – noted for its flamboyant unisex posh punk aesthetic.In another coup for Paris, the critically lauded Post Soviet label Situationist will make its Paris runway debut. Founded by Irakli Rusadze in 2015 in his native Georgia, Situationist’s architectural aesthetic and powerful silhouettes should guarantee it makes an impact on the French scene. 
The City of Light will also welcome Cecilie Bahnsen, the Copenhagen-born talent whose blend of romantic sophistication and high quality finish have already won her a top-level following among key international fashion boutiques and lovers of the intelligent avant grade.
 
The season will mark the return to Paris of Grace Wales Bonner, the brilliant young London tailor, whose experimental meditations on the meeting of black culture and British style have made her one of the UK’s most powerful designers. Back in 2016 in Paris, Wales Bonner won worldwide attention by winning the LVMH Prize, the first individual woman to take the 300,000 euro award.

"Aug 28, 2020","Paris fashion house AMI has revealed plans to stage a live physical runway show in Paris in the upcoming season, the latest independent fashion brand to confirm it will stage a live co-ed catwalk event during the city’s next fashion month. 
AMI thus joins fledgling French house, Koché, as the latest marque to guarantee it will stage an actual runway event, boosting the line-up at Paris Fashion Week. The next Paris women’s ready-to-wear season is scheduled to take place from Monday, September 28 to Tuesday, October 6.
 
“In my view, the only real way to present a collection is via a real défilé. Clothes have to be seen on a human body, on a live mannequin so one can truly appreciate how they hang, and how they move,” AMI’s founder and creative director Alexandre Mattiussi told FashionNetwork.com.
 
Mattiussi revealed that it will be an outside show and is awaiting authorization from the Paris prefecture before revealing the exact location in Paris.
 
“Yes, it will be an exterior event; so we hope it will be sunny day! And we have to stage this for very few people – 150 people at the maximum. Bien sûr, respecting social distancing and everyone wearing a mask,” stressed the designer.
 
After working for both Christian Dior, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, Mattiussi founded his house a decade ago this autumn, growing it into one of France’s hottest labels; a beguiling blend of understated French chic and Parisian nonchalance.
 
Like many French brands AMI forced to take a runway hiatus during the Covid-19 crisis and did not participate in the Paris digital season this summer.
 
“When I realized we couldn’t do a real show in June, I decided it was better not to speak, or even do anything digital. So, then decided to enter the women’s week in Paris. But, of course, we had to respect the calendar and there is always competition to enter that schedule. But, I am happy to say, the Fédération greeted with us open arms!” he explained.
 
The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM), French fashion’s governing body, controls the official calendar of all the runway seasons in Paris for women’s ready-to-wear, menswear and couture. It is due to unveil its provisional calendar early next month.
 
The upcoming AMI show will also be fully co-ed. “Women and men 50/50 - allowing us to show the full amplitude of our collections. We already showed the menswear in a showroom and online to clients very well in July. For the women’s part we will also have a showroom in October in Paris,” he explained.
 
“Honestly, these are collections that I adore. The ideas are the fruit of a certain moment, of remote working; furloughs and factories working part time. But the result is something particularly intimate. Truly very AMI, and with more poetry and romanticism,” Mattiussi concluded.

"Aug 27, 2020","Fashion Week Istanbul is planning an entirely digital season this autumn - five days scheduled to take place between October 12 and 16; and the latest catwalk week to be staged fully on the web in the wake of the global pandemic.The next season will mark the 15th of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Istanbul (MBFWI), which will be staged with the support of Türkiye Promotion Group (TTG), on international digital platforms.

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, Istanbul’s previous season was cancelled in March. This autumn’s fashion week in Turkey’s cultural capital will be focused on a virtual event space, featuring designer labels and designers presenting their ideas in digital format. The event calendar will also include virtual showrooms, panel sessions, podcasts and multidisciplinary collaborations.“As the rules of the fashion industry are addressed on a global scale, priorities and expectations are redefined, and alternative fashion week calendars and contents continue to be announced in the post-COVID-19 period, MBFWI will also welcome genderless collections this season in addition to womenswear and menswear collections, which have been presented within the same calendar since the very beginning of the event,” Fashion Week Istanbul explained in a release.

Runway shoots of the digital event with more than 30 designers will take place at Galataport İstanbul, the city’s cruise ship port, and Tophane-i Amire Culture and Arts Center, a former cannon-making factory first commissioned by Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II. The idea being to promote the cultural and historical heritage of Istanbul via global fashion platforms throughout the digital fashion week.

Fashion Week Istanbul will also be “season-free platform” presenting the end consumers Spring-Summer 2021 and Fall-Winter 2020/21 collections.

"Aug 27, 2020","New York Fashion Week will be taking place after all, from September 13 through 17, but with strict sanitation regulations. As the U.S. continues to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic, governor of New York Andrew Cuomo has announced a series of strict guidelines concerning the running of the upcoming fashion week, dedicated to women's ready-to-wear collections for Spring/Summer 2021.The presentations of these collections will be subject to a number of security measures seeking to prevent the spread of the virus. Only 50 spectators will be permitted at open-air runways, while indoor shows will essentially be closed events, as spaces will be limited to 50% of their capacity, including models and production teams. Spectators will not be permitted.

New York Fashion Week will be supported by digital platform Runway360, launched by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in July, and will feature a mixture of both physical and virtual runway shows, presentations and exclusive content provided by designers, as well as a cultural program. The calendar includes more than 40 brands, with some big names, such as Michael Kors and Proenza Schouler, having chosen to present their collections off-calendar in October instead.""The pandemic is far from over, but we're proud to support event organizer IMG in moving forward with NYFW, in adherence with strict state public health guidance. Safety, as always, is our top priority and we commend the hosts, and all participating designers, for their innovative, New York Smart solutions to bring this event to life,"" said Cuomo in a release.

New York Fashion Week will have to apply the standards imposed by the state department of health to combat the ongoing health crisis linked to the spread of Covid-19. These include the obligatory wearing of masks, the observance of social distancing, measuring the temperature of anyone entering venues, the limitation of personnel to a strict minimum and screening tests, among other measures.

""The past six months have been exceedingly difficult for the fashion industry, and we are proud to offer an avenue for designers, models, stylists, hair and makeup artists, photographers, production teams — and the innumerable other professionals who work in, or adjacent to, the fashion industry during New York Fashion Week — to safely get back to work this September,"" concluded Leslie Russo, executive vice president of IMG's fashion events group.

"Aug 26, 2020","What style of coats, jackets, and other outerwear will be your go-to this winter? According to the latest report from the Stylight research platform, the fringe jacket is clearly standing out a few days before the start of the September, building more and more fans around the world. In fact, fringe will be making its way onto your entire wardrobe this season, from dresses to shoes to bags.This is one of the outerwear stars of the fall-winter season, as the latest figures from Stylight show. The research platform reports an increase of more than 1,000% in clicks on fringe jackets compared to the same period last year, reflecting the growing consumer interest in this boho chic-inspired piece.

Fans of trench coats will also be spoiled for choice and on trend, as long as they appreciate leather models. Seen on numerous runways during the autumn-winter 2020 fashion shows last February, leather trench coats are already getting mass approval with a 698% increase in clicks in the category in one year.The great classics are also making a comeback when it comes to outerwear, such as the belted coat (+520%) and the double-breasted coat (+209%). Meanwhile, sleeveless styles are enjoying renewed interest from internet users, with +52% interest in vests and +63% interest in capes.

"Aug 26, 2020","Uniqlo’s next collab will be with Jil Sander, in a reprise of a link-up with the fashion legend which first began 11 years ago.
 
Back in 2009, the Japanese fast fashion giant worked together with Jil in the first project after launching with her own independent fashion consultancy.As in the debut association the collection will be named +J. This new collection will begin retailing this autumn.
 
Sander, who was baptized stylistically as the Queen of Less, gave a number of hints about what to expect in an interview with Uniqlo’s in-house magazine, LifeWear, where she also ruminated about her life in her native city of Hamburg.
 
“Uniqlo has a lot of experience and great knowledge of manufacturing. The production possibilities are endless and inspiring. This includes the well-oiled logistics, the infusion with Japanese culture and true mastership of detail,” said Sander, who somewhat ironically founded her own brand in 1968 with her mother’s sewing machine.

The 76-year-old designer who last quit the house she founded in October 2013, indicated that +J would concentrate on her fortes of minimalist design; pure silhouette and quality fabrics.“I don’t draw, I design on the body and do many fittings. Thus, I am always conscious of all angles and the three-dimensional form. The fitting process leads to new forms and proportions. My eye is my strongest tool, I can see what is wrong or dated, but also, where the energy comes in and when a design starts to look fresh. I also keep the customers and their diverse needs in mind. Figures, heights and complexions vary, so I try to interpret the collection with a regard to different combinations and a maximum of variability in mind,” she explained.

Sander launched her first Uniqlo collab with a selection of 40 pieces for men and women that included coats, jackets, knitwear and her signature form-fitting white Egyptian cotton T-Shirts. After three years, the two sides jointly ended the association in 2011, before then relaunching a one-off, best-off collection in 2014.

Looking back, Sander recalled in the interview how she got into fashion in the first place: “I started my career as fashion editor for a German fashion magazine. In this function, I organized and supervised fashion shootings. More often than not, I had trouble in achieving the look I had in mind. To improve the design pieces we had to photograph, I contacted the producers with my suggestions and proposed certain changes to their designs. Since I kept doing that, the biggest producer of high-tech fabrics got back to me and proposed that I design for him myself. In the end, it was more satisfying to actually create the clothes rather than shoot existing fashion which didn’t always respond to my esthetics.”

Since retiring Sander has led a discreet existence, staying far from the bright lights and concentrating on developing her own private garden near Hamburg.

“As a port city Hamburg has more channels and rivers than Venice. My first impressions of nature were the changing colors of the sky and its reflections in water. Later, we had a house in the countryside, not far from Hamburg. There, you have sweeping views of farmland, woods and meadows. I always loved the explosion of green in the spring. Since Northern Germany is quite windy, snowflake clouds sail above and change the tonality abruptly. The light here is famous for its purity and brilliancy. Its clarity is so strong, it almost x-rays everything. This light has always influenced my fabric decisions, not only the choice of color, but also of textile qualities. You cannot cheat in this light. Every detail of the weave is highlighted. Only the best quality stands the test,” the legendary designer concluded.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Aug 26, 2020","A select few fashion brands are managing to open boutiques this summer, but Dolce & Gabbana have chosen a more novel inauguration – a rarefied cabana in the Côte d’Azur’s most famous hotel.The Milanese designers have created a pop-up cabana inside Club Dauphin, the uber elegant restaurant and near Olympic sized seawater swimming pool of the Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, located at the point of the most exclusive peninsula on the French Riviera.

In keeping with their aesthetic, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana finished their cabana with bright hued prints inspired by Sicilian chariots; gold helmeted charioteers and puppet shows - seen on its day beds; loungers and seaside tables. Perched above a particularly glimmering stretch of the Mediterranean, the cabana offers magnificent views – taking in the Italian Riviera and Monaco to the east and Cap d’Antibes to the west.The Milanese marque also has an ephemeral boutique beside the pool at Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, a mythic location since its opening in 1908, which has hosted Winston Churchill; Picasso, who jotted down a sketch inside the swimming instructor’s notebook; and Coco Chanel, who enjoyed  afternoon tea there with Jean Cocteau; along with David Niven, Liz Taylor, Bono and Elton John.

The unique Dolce & Gabbana cabana marks yet another novel project by the pathbreaking designers, which continues even during the current pandemic. Next month, they will stage a series of glamorous events in Florence along with the city’s key fashion organization Pitti – which will include a luxury jewelry display; Alta Sartoria luxury menswear presentation inside the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence’s medieval city hall; and a live runway show of women’s Alta Moda, or haute couture. This luxury Tuscan fashion happening - running from September 2 to 4 - will kick off the reduced but still very much happening international runway season in the four key fashion capitals – New York, London, Milan and Paris.

The Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat is owned by Harvard-educated Len Blavatnik, the Ukrainian-born billionaire who controls Warner Brothers; has been knighted by the Queen; and was an early financier of Tory Burch. Since 2015, the hotel has been managed by the Four Seasons. Open until September 30, guests can book the cabana by day, or for a whole week, inside the supremely refined Club Dauphin, guided by its charming and efficient director Johann Burgos.

"Aug 25, 2020","The re-launch of Rochas’s men's ready-to-wear line seems to have been well and truly compromised. In early August, the Interparfums group, owner of the renowned Parisian label since 2015, announced the decision to put a stop to Rochas’s men's collections, which had been re-introduced on the market three years ago. The French group has stated in a press release it decided, after “taking into account the global outlook, to regretfully suspend all activities relating to the menswear collections by Rochas.”Interparfums thanked designer Federico Curradi “for his first-rate work as creative director of menswear, having succeeded, in just three seasons, in selling his collections to the world’s leading boutiques.”

In less than two years, the Florentine designer has been able to inject fresh zest in Rochas's menswear, engineering a soft transformation by introducing a more bohemian, relaxed style, in lieu of the polished, sophisticated Parisian-chic look initially devised by designer Béatrice Ferrant, when the label’s menswear line was first relaunched.Curradi had been in charge of Rochas Homme since January 2019, when Interparfums licensed the line to Onward Luxury Group (OLG), having relaunched it in 2017 through the work of an internal team led by Ferrant.

OLG, the Japanese fashion group’s Milan-based luxury subsidiary, has also held the license for some twelve years for the production and distribution of the Rochas womenswear line, styled until last February by Italian designer Alessandro Dell’Acqua. The name of Dell’Acqua’s successor has not yet been revealed. Among those mentioned, there is Cédric Charlier.

"Aug 19, 2020","An emblematic image of the Beirut blast disaster shows the heritage building of one of the city's best-known residents, world-renowned fashion designer Elie Saab, now in ruins.""Thank God everyone is OK,"" Saab told his team on his first visit to the house almost two weeks after the blast, as he picked his way through glass around a damaged marble-top table.

One of Lebanon's most famous exports, Saab has dressed British royal Kate Middleton among a host of A-list celebrities, his gowns gracing numerous red carpets on the likes of Halle Berry and Helen Mirren.His elegant home overlooking the main street of Beirut's fashionable Gemmayzeh district was frequented by celebrities from Lebanon and abroad.

Now, marble columns lie in pieces. Windows and a balcony have been smashed. A chandelier has been reduced to chunks of glass hanging limply from a tangle of wire.

The house, like the whole area, was gutted by the massive August 4 explosion that authorities have said was caused by a huge stock of ammonium nitrate stored at the nearby port. The blast disfigured huge swathes of the capital, killed 177 people and injured 6,500 more.

It ripped open the face of Saab's carefully renovated early 20th-century home, exposing one of the few examples of traditional Lebanese architecture left in the city after the 1975-1990 civil war.

""This place was alive,"" Saab's long-time assistant Johnny Zeinoun told AFP. ""To see it like this..."" he trailed off, looking at the destruction around him.

Few people were in the house at the moment of the explosion, Zeinoun said as he showed a video of the main hall just after the blast, jagged glass hanging from antique Damascene mother-of-pearl-inlaid mirrors. The first thing Saab asked was if anyone was hurt, Zeinoun recalled. ""He said, 'I don't want to hear that there's any blood'.""

Saab acquired the house in 2006 and renovated it with Venezuela-born, Beirut-based architect Chakib Richani.

""Saab wanted to protect the architectural identity and construction of the house,"" with its traditional-style arched windows and high ceilings, said fashion journalist Ali Jaffal, who works with the designer.

Pictures published by Architectural Digest in 2009 showed the graceful, airy central hall partitioned by marble columns framing tall triptych windows and warmed by the light of Ottoman-era chandeliers. Now, it is a scene of destruction. Through a gaping hole, wrecked homes can be seen across the street, their blown-out windows and doors leaving them equally exposed.

Several of the neighbourhoods hardest hit by the blast, including Gemmayzeh, housed art galleries and boutiques, along with hip bars and restaurants.

Their destruction dealt a devastating blow to a creative sector already beleaguered by Lebanon's worst economic crisis since the civil war.

Saab was not the only big name in Lebanese fashion to have a home or business badly damaged. The headquarters of designer Zuhair Murad, just a stone's throw from the port, were devastated in the blast. Images shared on social media show detritus spilling out of once-glittering display windows, and lettering hanging loose from the building's facade. ""The efforts of years went in a moment,"" Murad wrote on Instagram.

And just down the road from Saab's home is the flagship atelier of designer Rabih Kayrouz, housed in the 19th-century Dagher Palace. Kayrouz, who has dressed stars such as Celine Dion and Jada Pinkett Smith, posted pictures of the damage, showing chunks of the red-tiled roof blasted off.

""We are leaving... this beautiful lady to recover,"" Kayrouz wrote on Instagram. ""We will be back soon.""

But despite the damage piling more hardship on top of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis that has fuelled angry anti-government protests, Zeinoun said Saab was committed to rebuilding. ""The main goal of Mr. Saab is to reconstruct,"" he said. ""'We started once, we can start again',"" Saab told him.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Aug 13, 2020","The Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana has unveiled the provisional calendar for Milan Fashion Week, which will be held from September 23-28. While the organizers are returning to a more traditional approach to the event for this edition, with more than half of the shows to be presented physically on site, some 20 shows will be presented digitally. And so once again for this season, the public at home should be able to have a front-row seat for certain presentations. The global health crisis has forced fashion designers and labels to reinvent their approaches in order to adhere to social-distancing measures implemented by various governments around the world. As a result, various Fashion Weeks took place as digital events this past June and July. While it was nothing short of major upheaval for some involved, it was a bonanza for the public, who were able to attend -- virtually -- a host of shows during these unprecedented sessions. 

Now, the organizers, Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, have announced a return to regular programming -- or almost, for the upcoming shows taking place in September, dedicated to spring/summer 2021 collections. No fewer than 28 shows will take place physically in Milan, albeit with a limited number of guests in order to respect social-distancing measures. Fendi, Alberta Ferretti, N°21, Prada, Max Mara, Etro, Boss, Tod's and Salvatore Ferragamo are among the labels that plan to return to the traditional runway format. Is the future of fashion 'phygital'?

A shortened combination of the terms ""physical"" and ""digital,"" ""phygital"" could well become the norm for the next few seasons of Fashion Weeks, and for fashion at large. With the global pandemic seemingly not going away anytime soon, inciting some labels to present their new collection in an online format, this new approach could be the go-to for many brands in the long term. This September, Missoni, Dsquared2, Genny, Philipp Plein, Marco de Vincenzo and Ermanno Scervino are all planning for digital shows. 

And beyond the shows, the health crisis has driven luxury brands and fashion labels to focus more on the digital realm with the launch of new virtual showrooms, allowing large numbers of consumers to visualize and shop the latest collections from their sofas. One notable example is Balmain's recreation of its legendary Paris address featuring an avatar of the brand's creative director, Olivier Rousteing, to welcome online visitors.

While e-shops are nothing new, nor are they the result of measures linked to Covid-19, they could increasingly take the place of physical shops, or, at the very least, become true virtual window displays. Augmented reality, which allows users to try on clothes in a 'fitting room' from behind a simple screen or to test out makeup shades, is already helping the sector reinvent itself.

"Jul 23, 2020","Dior unveiled a magically infused cruise collection on Wednesday night in the main square of Lecce in Puglia, the home region of the father of the house’s couturier Maria Grazia Chiuri. An homage to her country, in a unique display of Italian savoir-faire and ancient artisanal skills that harnessed the mystical roots of southern Italy.
 
A collection that expressed the myths and rituals of Puglia – like the Tarantula dance, where Chiuri referencing Italian anthropologist Ernesto De Martino’s theories of the dance’s magical dimensions. 
Due to the pandemic, the show was staged before a handful of friends and family. Nonetheless, the sheer production was lavish, with intense dance playing a leading role. Chiuri invited in Israeli choreographer Sharon Eyal into a giant piazza in Lecce, the dancers building to a frenetic climax evoking ancestral rites.  Previously, Eyal has staged a brilliant display of her dance troupe for Dior’s ready-to-wear collection staged inside Longchamp racetrack in September 2018.
 
Backed up by a custom-made soundtrack from Paolo Buonvino, who composed the haunting music to Le Mythe Dior, Matteo Garrone’s brilliant surrealist film made for Dior’s recent haute couture collection. Buonvino developing an “alliance of cultures” for this show, blending electronic music with the orchestra of the Fondazione Notte della Taranta. While the dancers leapt, slid, pirouetted and emoted in a way that captured the somnolent energy of Puglia.“I began this project last November and I went to Puglia and did all the research, which to me is the point of cruise. Voyaging to different parts of the world and working with local artists to create something new, in somewhere new. And I thought, despite the pandemic, that we had to present this collection there. Respecting social distancing of course,” explained Chiuri, who vacations annually in her father’s old farmhouse just south of Lecce. She took her bow at the finale amid the dancers, not the models.
  
Hard to envisage a more evocative setting, the giant Piazza del Duomo of Lecce, reconfigured with Luminarie – giant light lighting gantries that the Pugliese love to erect on churches or city streets for their traditional city fetes. But revisited by the artist Marinella Senatore - adding another layer to a complex dialogue of cultures and crafts in this show. Senatore once installed a mammoth luminarie on the High Line reading Give Your Daughter Difficult Dreams, very much in synch with the committed feminism of Chiuri’s reign at Dior. The house’s famed atelier also went into overdrive producing some delicate luminarie tulle cocktails that will surely be coveted by Dior followers.

The whole collection rippled with references to the heel of the boot in the Italian peninsula. Like the traditional straw men made of raffia which morphed into a whole new design concept. The couturier also playing with classical motifs of flora and nature, creating refined looks, like an exotic black suede bustier, delicately embroidered with mountain flowers and bearing the motif – 'Les Parfums sont les Sentiments des Fleurs', or 'Scents are flowers’ sentiments'. Part of a series of some 250 drawings created especially for this collection by Maria Grazia’s good friend artist Pietro Ruffo, taking inspiration from Giovanni Battista Ferrari’s 1638 book of illustrations De Florum Cultura.
 
The evocation of Puglia operated on multiple levels; such as the 'Tombolo', a style of lace developed in the 15th century, made by hand painstakingly, using a paper sketch strapped on to a cylindrical cushion. Seen with finesse in some beautiful straw-hued mesh evening dresses and ladylike tunics with matching lace butterflies, that managed to be simultaneously earthy and dreamlike. Even the bar jacket got a Pugliese makeover in fabrics from local artisans at the Constantine Foundation.
 “Tombolo reminded me of where certain of my passions were born. My grandmother used to do tombolo. All of the ladies she knew did too. But it was considered domestic work. This show helps people realize that this is an artistic statement. In Italy, we still do not value our artisans enough. It’s a great part of our culture,” smiled Chiuri in a pre-show preview in Paris.

This Dior show also marked the end of a unique summer season of shows and presentations in Europe, where almost every collection was an online experience, with practically no life models.
 
'Tessuti Calabrese', an antique form of weaving also found an outlet; as did dramatic dresses done in prints of Renaissance charts, maps and mythological lions and flowers. While Chiuri also played with traditional local hand-made straw hats, converting them into Parisian-style cloche with logo bands.  All pulled together in a mood board that featured Maria Grazia’s mother as a young woman looking the spitting image of the couturier. 
 
Also impressing were great new costume jewelry, referencing some Hellenistic knot pendants from the 3rd century BC in Puglia, which was once a colony of Ancient Greece.
 
“When I visited Puglia as a child, I discovered a town called Bovesia where they still spoke Greek! They call it Griko. They still do. Can you believe it!” marveled Chiuri.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 22, 2020","Cuban girls are turning face masks into a fashion accessory for their quinceanera photoshoots, designing them to match their 15th birthday party outfits - both out of safety concerns and to show how they came of age during the coronavirus pandemic.Cuba made face masks obligatory in public spaces early on in the outbreak and credits them with helping it contain the spread of the coronavirus on the island. On Monday it registered zero new cases nationwide.

As the country eases lockdown restrictions, face masks are even becoming part of the quinceanera celebrations - a rite of passage into womanhood common throughout Latin America - that typically includes photoshoots with many glamorous ensembles.“I had to design my face masks to fit with my outfit and for all the colors to work,” said birthday girl Sofia Valenzuela, on the sidelines of a beach photoshoot in a floaty white dress.

“The face mask was really important because it marked an important stage of my life, these three months of pandemic.”

Valenzuela did some of her shoots without a mask - like the one on the beach - and others with, especially in urban spaces.

In one, for example, she poses in front of a Havana wall covered in colorful graffiti while wearing a black top, black and white checkered mini skirt, and matching face mask.

Her seamstress Migdalaixis Sanchez said she interlaced black and white stripes to create the material for the cloth mask. Some shops are still shut in the wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown so creating matching masks is not always easy.
“I had to innovate,” she said. “You have to please those celebrating their quinceanera.”

Photographer Manuel Padron, who has been shooting quinceaneras for more than 10 years, says the girls find sporting a face mask - called “nasobuco” or “nose mouth” in Cuban Spanish - eye-catching “as if it was part of the whole show.”

Birthday girl Thaidelen Gonzalez said it was also simply about being careful.
“The photos will turn out well anyway so wearing a face mask and looking after oneself is not too onerous,” she said.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Jul 22, 2020","Graduate Fashion Foundation and TikTok have concluded their two-week manufacturing residency in Fashion Enter’s factory in North London.58 fashion design graduates from across the UK were invited to participate in the initiative, which sought to support emerging designers’ careers by offering them an opportunity to access practical industry experience and learn new skills.

Students were asked to design and manufacture TikTok’s first-ever range of European merchandise. During the two-week project, they learnt about design for manufacturing, grading and realising designs into commercial patterns, production lines and quality control. Leading designers including Henry Holland provided mentoring alongside GFF patrons and TikTok creators.Holland, designer and global ambassador for GFF said: “I’m so impressed by what the graduates have achieved in the last two weeks. They’ve done their own original prints, some have made up to 10 garments, one girl made 20 bags and the tenacity and the drive of these young people is insane.”

All winning graduates who attended the residency received a competition prize of £500 and documented their design and manufacturing process to share their experience on TikTok. 

GFF, which organises the Graduate Fashion Week, said that the limited-edition designs will be gifted to their Creator and VIP community.

Cassandra Russell, Brand Partnerships, Fashion & Retail at TikTok explained: “We’re sending these out to a combination of influencers and our most VIP clients, so it’ll be the head of marketing for Burberry getting one of these items, and lots of other fashion houses too.”

Commenting on the project, Hilary Alexander from the Graduate Fashion Foundation said: “I’m incredibly impressed with the standards and the variety of designs and although in some cases they used a logo or the TikTok colours, it’s not typical logo merchandise, it’s new and innovative and the spirit of TikTok.”

The social media platform plans to create a commercial capsule collection made up of selected designs for further gifting to staff and partners across Europe.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 21, 2020","Organizers in Paris have yet to decide whether they will stage actual physical runway season this fall, but one French designer – Christelle Kocher - is certainly planning to go ahead.The very happening Parisian released a statement explaining that Koché will stage a physical show inside: “My beloved Parc... Beautiful nature in the heart of Paris. I go there every morning, it’s my walking ritual, my green lung.”

The release came with an image of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, a steep soaring park in the 19th arrondissement commissioned by Napoleon III and built by Jean-Charles Alphand, a master engineer also responsible for Parc Monceau, Bois de Vincennes and the Bois de Boulogne.Notably, Kocher also sent out an image of the park’s most famous feature, the Temple of Sibylle, inspired by the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, near Rome; and perched on a cliff 50 meters above an artificial lake.

“And it will be open to everyone, in accordance with the health directives,” added Kocher who is on something of a creative roll. In February, Kocher presented an acclaimed collection in Milan for Pucci as a guest designer, blending her active sport athletic style with the high lush color prints of the Florentine house. The 2019 winner of the ANDAM Grand Prize, Kocher founded her own label five years ago, while also managing to hold down a night job as artistic director of Chanel’s Maison d’Art Lemarié.

“The shows have always been a way to share our vision, to create a specific emotion, to invite different communities. They have been the basis of the brand from day one and I can’t imagine presenting a collection without this meaningful celebration. Real body movin’ !!! Hope to see you there. Love xxx Christelle,” the designer added.

"Jul 21, 2020","In a sudden reverse in plans, Fendi has announced that it will stage its next runway show in Milan – and not Rome - during the next women’s ready-to-wear catwalk season  in September.“Fendi is pleased to announce that Milan will be the venue for its Men and Women Spring/Summer 2021 Collections presentation show at the upcoming Milan Fashion Week,” the Rome-based luxury fashion house confirmed in a release.

The decision comes exactly four weeks after Fendi had revealed amid much fanfare that it would stage its next ready-to-wear show in its Rome headquarters, the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, some 600 kilometers south of Milan.“Pending the development of the calendar by the CNMI (the National Chamber of Italian Fashion) and following an initial hypothesis to hold the event at its headquarters in Rome to keep contributing to the close relationship of the Maison with the City, Fendi now confirms its fashion show in Milan, on Wednesday 23rd September 2020,” the LVMH-owned house added.
 
Though founded in Rome in 1925 and based in the Italian capital, Fendi has almost always shown its ready-to-wear collections on catwalks in Milan. For the past several years, the house has utilized a long gallery in a former factory in a key fashion business section of Milan on via Andrea Solari. Though the house has staged occasional fashion spectaculars in the Eternal City, notably a brilliant collection by Silvia Fendi inside the Temple of Venus and Roma, the largest temple in ancient Rome, in July 2019.
 
“At such a sensitive time for the industry, the return of fashion shows represents a fundamental opportunity to enhance the excellence of Italian fashion and relaunch the whole sector. An occasion that the Roman luxury house supports, in synergy with the other brands of Made in Italy and members of the CNMI, starting from Milan, which in recent months has been hit hard and that now, also through fashion, is once again a symbol of revival for the whole country,” it continued.

Last month, Fendi was one of the first major brands to stage a live event, as the world emerged out of the global lockdown. A special performance of Antonio Vivaldi’s Estate from The Four Seasons, performed by the orchestra of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and star violinist Anna Tifu, all staged at Fendi's headquarters.

“Enhancing Italian excellence and giving a strong signal of recovery are part of Fendi’s commitment for this country, which has begun with “Anima Mundi” in Rome, an exciting tribute to its Roman origins,” concluded Fendi in its statement.

"Jul 20, 2020","After a marathon 13 days of online fashion shows and events – from French haute couture to Italian sportswear – it’s useful to take stock and consider what worked and what didn’t after the industry passed through the first purely digital summer fashion season in history. 
Happy to report there were several genuine virtual fashion moments, along with plenty of salutary lessons to be learned for the future. Certainly, the experience of sitting stuck before their desks tops and screens made every editor only long to return to an actual show. Doubly so, when the images of an actual live show, Jacquemus’ Field of Dreams collection in a giant wheat field northeast of Paris, went viral, reminding the entire industry of how great fashion shows can be almost spiritual experiences.
 
However, despite ending the nearly two weeks with an aching back from peering endlessly at a desktop, it’s clear to most editors that the season has been a learning curve for every house. All of whom will exploit the digital possibilities that this July revealed: whether to brand build; prep an ad campaign; tease an audience; stimulate private customers, or simply to create a proper online showroom.
 
It all began in Paris with an off-calendar live video streaming of the backstage of Hermès menswear department on Sunday, July 5; and ended, more or less, with Missoni in Milan the afternoon of Friday; July 17. Then again not quite, since Valentino is planning a semi-live event in Rome tomorrow, and Christian Dior will present its cruise collection before friends and family in the main piazza of Lecce in Puglia on Thursday evening. So, who were the big winners, and losers, of the season? And which brands merited recognition for their digital ideas? Here are 10 picks; eight 'dos' and two 'don’t's. 
Best use of live streaming - Gucci
This award has to go to Gucci, where Alessandro Michele, in a brilliant reversal of the restrictions of the lockdown, picked the house’s creative team as his cast. They may not have been gorgeous runway creatures, but they more than made up for that with their self-confidence, attitude and innate sense of style. Staged over almost 12 hours, from the making of to the denouement, the whole event bristled with iconoclastic imagination - from its grand location in the storied Palazzo Sacchetti to the retro-pop MTV graphics to the brainy cast. No wonder they called it The Final Act of a Fairy Tale.
 
Best video – Christian Dior
Definitely the award goes to Matteo Garrone’s stupendous video for Le Mythe Dior, shot in ancient ruins around Rome. Dior did get clobbered on social media for the lack of any models of color in the video. But the fantasy of nymphs discovering tiny stockman versions of the latest Dior ready-to-wear, brought to them by two Dior hotel porters was an instant classic of surrealist cinema.  
 
Best phygital fashion – Ermenegildo Zegna XXX
No designer tapped more into the potential of blending live with recorded than Alessandro Sartori’s livestreaming show that climaxed on the roof of Zegna’s historic headquarters overlooking the Italian Alps. Top-shelf tailoring meets classy staging.
 Best shows in a box – JW Anderson and Loewe
The only designer to put a great deal of effort into his invitations was Jonathan Anderson both at his own brand at Loewe. Sending out a fabric covered file full of sketches, looks, dried flowers and unlikely fabrics for JW Anderson; and a whole dossier with cutouts; influences; and even a mini 45 RPM record. And the result was two very cunning methods to make a creative statement and to tempt an audience with some eye-catching new clothes.
 
Best indie brand clip – Davi Paris
Not much cash but acres of imagination in this clifftop frolic which encapsulates the freedom of hanging out with your young mates in early summer.  French insouciance at its best.
 
Most subtle display of clothes – Juun.J
Juun.J has been staging tremendous shows in Paris for several seasons; so it was great to see the brand pull off an elegiac black and white video of his nation’s capital – SeoulSoul. Juun.J is the ghost of Gianfranco Ferré meets Rick Owens; the most dynamic designer in the most dynamic culture in Asia – South Korea.
 
Best statement on the zeitgeist – Versace
Donatella invited UK rapper AJ Tracey to stage a livestream  performance in her video clip. And the result was a timely statement on today’s key issues - Black Lives Matter and people’s empowerment. And, the clothes looked marvelous too. 
Best recognition of artisanal Italy - Santoni and Tod’s
The backbone of Italian design is its remarkable artisans. Few of whom fashion editors and VIPs ever meet in Milan or Rome. Certain houses shot films in their home regions to better express their DNA and what distinguishes each of them. Like two great footwear brands from Le Marche – Santoni and Tod’s.
 
Sometimes it’s just plain refreshing to see a well-put-together product video, where one can appreciate the innate quality of what’s on display. Case in point: master shoemaker Santoni, with an admirable clip called ""Origini, An Emotional Narration."" Set in Le Marche, the ruggedly proud region on the Adriatic halfway down the Italian boot, and an ideal location to highlight the patina of a great pair of crocodile loafers, or woven leather sneakers as models marched on an almost lunar rocky shore. Voyaging inland to the Apennines, the jaggedly cut green valleys were an ideal backdrop for pewter-hued moccasins or superb loafers.

“I’m trying to make the DNA of Tod’s my own... Riffing on '70s jet set,” explained Chiapponi, walking through the all-white buildings; from design studio to research department to workshop, capturing the first phases of the  creative process. From moulds to mood boards; from yarns to craftspeople. All the way to a photo shoot where Italian models
 
Best pure fashion statement – Plan C
For pure design chops our favourite statement was by Plan C, and some remarkable patchwork assemblage dresses with images of mountain cabins; electric pylons, soaring peaks and overgrown meadows untouched by any farmer in lockdown. Exactly the images seen in a lyrical video Plan C designer Carolina Castiglioni shot in the foothills of the Alps.
 
“Everyone is a landscape,” commented the designer, who appeared in her own video as a model. Add in some simple and refined flowing summer picnic dresses in windbreaker stripes and a buttoned-up, funnel neck trench in a naïve print. The result: another great collection from the rising star of Milan fashion.
 
Beautiful is not necessarily best – Maison Margiela
The house of Margiela presented a series of color-saturated videos over several days during the season, many of which had a wonderful sense of refinement. However, their techie Pointillist style meant it was very hard to see any actual clothes, or indeed understand what John Galliano was trying to express. 
Laziest effort – Dries Van Noten
This award has to go to Dries Van Noten, whose clip of a young lad mock-drumming inside a strobe-lit set was video indolence par excellence.

"Jul 19, 2020","The last day of Milan Digital Fashion Week displayed a broad spectrum of Italian creativity. Following the surprising visual marathon offered by Gucci and Ermenegildo Zegna’s superb performance on a three-kilometre catwalk, Missoni brought this unique fashion week to a close with a film celebrating the house’s history, featuring archive photos, runway clips and moving testimonies. The brand’s story is an iconic tale of Italian-made style revolving around one family and an instantly recognisable aesthetic, distilled in the house’s famous zigzag and colourful mosaic patterns.
 Eleventy is another pretty Italian brand and a regular at Milan Fashion Week, where it shows its chic yet laidback collections featuring ultra-light knitwear and delicate fabrics. In this season’s video, creative director Marco Baldassari presented the house’s Spring/Summer 2021 collection himself, revealing clothes conceived for the post-quarantine world, for a lifestyle based around the home. The pieces were comfortable but always elegant – perfect for working remotely.
 
The wardrobe could be divided into four major styles. Classic Italian chic, with all the effortless elegance of Marcello Mastroianni in La Dolce Vita, could be seen in casual white suits, jackets reimagined with new fabrics such as jersey, drawstring trousers and striped sweaters. A more urban aesthetic was present in multipocketed cotton suits, ideal for when you’re speeding around the city on a bike. For those doing business from home, there was a series of hybrid sporty-formal looks combining sneakers and sweaters with banker jackets. Finally, there was the denim: essential jeans offered in a range of washes.“Made in Italy” was also the approach taken by Federico Cina, who celebrated the values of his native Emilia-Romagna, and Gall, which came at the idea from a different angle, proposing a mysterious, vaguely unsettling film where strange backpackers masked by balaclavas and hoods followed each other through a mountainous landscape under a cold light. The video was a faithful reflection of the futuristic warrior aesthetic that has come to represent the brand, which was founded in Rome in 2014, by American designer Justin Gall and Chiara Nardelli. 
The activewear stylings of Gall’s urban warriors included cargo pants and windbreakers masquerading as parkas, stuffed with pockets and zips, and cut in ultra-performance technical fabrics with innovative properties, like nylon which adapts to the body’s movements, or an ashy-coloured, wrinkled material with prints that could be smeared but which also returned to their original state.
 
Italian designer Andrea Pompilio offered up a film with a wandering narrative that involved a man and a woman wearing the same outfit: a pair of straight-leg navy trousers, a white shirt and a black men’s jacket. These two protagonists came together in a series of symbolic scenes representing the sensations that people around the world have been feeling over the last few months.
 
There were also two Japanese labels on the programme: JieDa, which made its Milan debut in January, and Children of the Discordance. Founded by Hiroyuki Fujita in 2007, the former, which is distributed by multibrand retailer Kikunobu, came up with a film noir channelling a distinctly 80s aesthetic.Viewers followed a group of Tokyo bad boys as they float through the urban night in oversized suits. Ties too were of an exaggerated size and stamped with the label’s gothic initials, as were the baggy shirts with wide collars, while pants were worn long and creased or short and flared. A pearl necklace could be spotted on a black turtleneck, along with 50s pin-up girls printed on shirts or the lining of a jacket.
 
Having started out at Ships and launched trendy multibrand retailer Acycle in Tokyo’s iconic Harajuku neighbourhood in 2005, Hideaki Shikama created Children of the Discordance with a group of friends in 2011 and has run the label solo since 2013. His video harked back to street culture, following skaters in typically baggy streetwear as they hit the tarmac for a nocturnal spin.
 
The emphasis was on fabrics and prints, which the designer makes himself, and which gave this collection a unique edge. Detail was everywhere: in a jumper with diamond cut-outs, in tribal-looking patchwork shirts with ethnic motifs and even in a giant embroidered fish on the back of a jacket.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 17, 2020","Man met machine and nature at Ermenegildo Zegna on Friday afternoon in the most coherently stylish statement so far in fashion of a “phygital” collection. 
Using a blend of web streaming; classy videos; live slo-mo and detailing this was a smart manner in which to present a powerful collection – a meeting of technically striking fabrics; highly innovative tailoring and optimism for the future, in the midst of the global pandemic.
 
The action opened in the company’s plant in Trivero, the camera slipping through the looms and gliding through a mature wood before entering a beautiful garden. The camera soars and sways as it captures the cast marching over the crest of a hill in 42 looks from the spring-summer 2021 collection of Ermenegildo Zegna XXX, the house’s bespoke line.“We wanted a full collection and not a capsule and on the schedule. This year is the 110th anniversary of the company and we wanted to express what Zegna stands for, which is nature; humanity and men; machine and technology,” explained the house’s creative director Alessandro Sartori, on the final day of the debut Milan digital runway season.
 
Zegna had originally planned to celebrate the anniversary in Trivero, so Sartori’s impulse was to keep the brief but with a radically new format.
 
“I thought let’s do the show there anyway. Trivero embodies the collection and was where it takes shape. So, last weekend we shot 60% of the show in the nature and amid the looms, and today we shoot live and mix it all together,” he enthused, from his studio in Milan, before departing for the live event in Trivero, 45 minutes away in the Piedmont.
 
Blending camera live and recorded camera shots; doing slo-mo and drone shots during the streaming in a show entitled Nature/Man/Machine. 
The first models descended the hill in a flawlessly cut suits; beautifully draped double-breasted with just one front button showing. Fluid dusters in micro fibers; and kimono style jerkins underline the carefully crafted silhouette. Major statements also in parkas and cabans, shown with large patch pockets and assembled in recycled double-face wools. Patch pockets everywhere - on fishermen vests, mock hunting jackets and tunics – always finished with a noble dash.
 
“Soft tailoring but with fully constructed interiors
And even interior drawstrings. Made in recycled wools,” noted Sartori. Who showed off how he had displaced interior canvas at the shoulder; and created jackets without any stitching above the front pockets. 

At one stage, the cast walked into the massive Zegna archive so large it looked like the Vatican Library, before exiting into the family’s ravishing cobbled pathway garden.  Designed by two master Italian gardeners and landscape artists – Pietro Porcinai and Paolo Pejrone - they provided an ideal setting for such classy clothes, which ended with a sunset stroll through the dappled light in a forest, worthy of the opening scenes of Kurosawa’s Throne of Blood.
 
“The gardens are our Oasis Zegna. They were done in the ‘50s and ‘60s for my father and uncle. Today they are our summer house. You see, we have deep roots,” smiled CEO Gildo Zegna, as he popped into the preview.

Add in a few cricket blazers in green gray silk viscose gabardine or archive pajama stripe suits in silk and mohair for smart summer lunches and you got a great contemporary menswear statement. That reeks class and looks very today.
 
“Gray on gray on gray; and available from our bespoke atelier,” smiled Sartori.The designer offered two contrasting pants – one large at top and narrow at bottom; the other roomy from top to bottom. For party action, a series of great blotchy print shirts culled from the archive - tie-dyed yarn that is then woven to create a tie-dye chiné. 
 
In a palette that evoked nature, influenced by images from National Geographic photographer Mattias Klum.
 
Before the cast completed their 3.3 kilometer catwalk by marching onto the roof of the Lanificio Zegna headquarters with a magnificent view of the Italian alpine foothills. The soundtrack featuring Natureboy Flako’s driving track Theme For A Dream leading them into formation as Sartori joined them to take his bow.
 
The collection seen this Friday will be available in stores in January, while its pre-collection has been in the showroom over a week. The house also shot some 3,500 photos of this collection, inside and out, to help retailers in China and the Americas unable to travel to Milan. However, Zegna still expects one third of its clients to make it to Milan this summer.
 
And in another clever piece of staging, a day before, black British actor Parker Sawyers, dressed in a very natty Zegna tuxedo, extended online “a very special invitation to see the beautiful clothing and beautiful artistry of Zegna.”
 
“Oh, the cut, the texture it’s exquisite,” croons Sawyers, whose big breakout role was playing a young Barack Obama in Southside With You. It’s worth recalling that at a moment of Black Lives Matter, Zegna’s ambassador for the past two seasons has been Mahershala Ali, the double Oscar winning black actor. They walk the walk at Zegna.

"Jul 17, 2020","Leave it to Alessandro Michele to make a collection video unlike anything we’ve seen before; one whose cast was composed of the creative team that designed the actual clothes and accessories on display. 
Presented Friday morning, the final day of the four-day debut Milan Digital Fashion Week, the house’s contribution was entitled Gucci Epilogue. And all shot in Rome.

“I wanted to honor the magic ritual of a fashion show: a sacred and unique liturgy thanks to which creative thinking is revealed and offered as an interpretation to a community of free spectators. I wanted to lift the curtain on the backstage,” explained Michele, who appeared several times in a pop-up window in this online show.Artfully staged inside Palazzo Sacchetti in Rome, a particular beautiful Renaissance palace on central via Giulia, distinctive for its brilliant trompe l’oeil Renaissance frescos and giant heads of goddess that adorn its terracotta roof. It’s also located a few hundred yards from both Michele’s own apartment and his Gucci design studio.This was actually a live streaming, even if it featured lots of pre-recorded videos. It began by focusing on one unknown woman in a white waffle cotton dressing gown about to get her makeup done pre-show, as masked individuals scurried about. She turned out to be Sandrine Delloye, Gucci’s kid’s designer; one of a dozen senior individuals from Michele’s creative team who made up the cast. Taking creative confinement and husbanding one’s resources to a new level. 
 
Delloye wore one of the final looks, number 76E, shamrock green pants; silk blouse and turban with a fab floral print blazer. While hand bag designer Beatrice Gianni wore the first look, a classic assemblage by Michele of worsted G logo waistcoat and jacket over red knee-length skirt and snakeskin boots. Finished with a silver pendant cross and multiple chunky bangles it was vintage Alessandro – a happy meeting of déclassé aristocrat and well-read intellectual babe.

In a co-ed collection, women’s wear designer Daniele Grande was next up in a faded plaid gent’s coat worn over a Gondolier’s sweater and jeans. Like most every look, Daniele was shown in triplicate: often model’s color card photos, that were super-imposed on life images of the interior of the palazzo, or the garden, where a small round trampoline had been installed. Occasionally the color cards were video, making it very easy to get a precise idea of the actual clothes.  Each shot often juxtaposed by photos of fruit and vegetables – from earthy tomato to purple cabbage to split peas.A voiceover explained this was all a Final Act of the Fairy Tale, the end of a trilogy. Michele appearing on screen again post-show, explaining that due to the pandemic, “the creator had now become the performer.”

All told, a very witty manner in which to display a particularly colorful and playful Gucci collection, where the clothes were intermingled with shots of cracked dolls; 19th century drawling rooms; and worn settees in abandoned yards.

“In the company where I work, people share the idea that change is essential, interesting and must be practiced, that you need to be brave. And not only did I practice courage, but I understood that you don’t really need courage, you just need to do what you feel,” concluded Michele, after probably his most personal aesthetic statement to date in his revolutionary reign at Gucci.

"Jul 17, 2020","Film star Marcello Mastroianni, John F. Kennedy, even Prince Charles -- all have donned handmade ties from one shop in Naples so famed for its artisanal finery some devotees boast thousands.The painstaking needlework cannot be rushed, despite demand for E. Marinella ties usually far outstripping production.

In Naples, the tiny shop near the sea remains much as it was when it opened in 1914, with its wood-framed windows, chandelier, and counter where the red, blue, polka dot or diamond-patterned ties are displayed.Maurizio Marinella, 64, who is the third generation to head up the company, says his family's success in the southern Italian city, which struggles with poverty and unemployment, was ""a kind of miracle"".

""It all started in 20 square metres in Naples, where everything is a little more difficult than elsewhere,"" he told AFP.

Maurizio's grandfather Eugenio wanted to create ""a little corner of England in Naples"" in this city with its view of Mount Vesuvius, offering men's shirts and accessories with fabrics shipped directly across the Channel.

Little by little, however, the tie became Marinella's signature piece.'Maniacal' care for detailThe silk is still hand-printed in Macclesfield, England, and the ties themselves are sewn by hand in a workshop close to the boutique, which employs 20 seamstresses.

Loyal customer Rudy Girardi has been frequenting the shop since his late teens and now boasts ""thousands of Marinella ties"", costing from between 130 to 215 euros.

""The tie is fundamental,"" he says, as a sign of ""respect"", and he loves Marinella for its ""maniacal care for every detail"".

He changes his ties several times a day, selecting a colourful one in the morning, something a little more institutional in the afternoon, and an elegant option for upmarket dinners.

Each Marinella tie takes about 45 minutes to make, with ten steps in all, from cutting the silk to doing the stitching, and adding the loop and label.

""It's precision work, comparable to that of a goldsmith. We work on half-millimetres,"" says Maria Rosaria Guarino, 60, who has worked for the company for 38 years.

Customers can personalise the length, width or thickness of the ties.

Every day, about 150 ties are produced. But the demand pre-coronavirus crisis was much higher -- as much as double or even triple. And in the three months leading up to Christmas, it could be ""as high as 900 ties a day"", Marinella said.

The company had ruled out making more, however, saying it would compromise quality. ""Each tie is a unique work of art"", he says, admitting that ""quality is almost an obsession"" for him.

Personalities from all over the world have donned the ties, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- a ""giant for whom we made ties 65 centimetres longer than normal"".'Pamper them'Almost every day, Sunday included, from 6.30am, Marinella is at the shop to ""welcome, pamper the customers, offer them coffee"", in the pure Neapolitan tradition.

While the brand had a turnover of 18 million euros in 2019, it is expected to suffer a ""significant"" drop this year because of the coronavirus epidemic, which forced the shop to close, stopped tourism and saw many formal events cancelled.

The sector has suffered in general, even before the pandemic.

Exports of ties, bow ties and neckties fell by 10 percent between 2015 and 2019, with Chinese products making up 46.5 percent of the market, compared to 13.6 percent for Italy, according to the International Trade Centre (ITC).

Fads are to blame: youngsters have gone off ties, and some big firms and banks have made wearing one optional.

""Fortunately, fashions are cyclical. Lately we've seen a bit of a shift away from street wear to classic fashion, where the tie is the cardinal point,"" notes 25-year-old Alessandro Marinella, who represents the company's fourth generation.

He wants to shift the house's focus ""towards a 'total look', including women's wear"", a move begun a few years ago, so that the humble tie now represents less than half the company's turnover -- though all of its reputation.Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Jul 17, 2020","For next summer, Milanese designers have chosen to concentrate on essentials. The third day of the Milan Digital Fashion Week featured pared-down, nearly non-existent collections and lines - the clothes sometimes barely hinted at - and seemed as bare as some of the presentation videos, with a focus on the summer 2021 pre-collections. Clearly, in these post-lockdown times, labels prefer to concentrate on a limited selection of distinctive garments alongside a set of easier, more straightforward and often monochrome items.
 DSquared2 stood out on Thursday, presenting one of the most comprehensive, multi-faceted wardrobes, with twin brothers and designers Dean and Dan Caten acting as MCs. The Caten brothers stood up from their film director chairs and faced the camera on a pretend film set, inviting the audience to enjoy a backstage glimpse of the photoshoot for their Spring/Summer 2021 pre-collection’s campaign.
 
The film’s first part, shot in black and white, is dedicated to “formal wear and tailoring,” featuring sombre-coloured suit-and-tie sets with a retro feel, rigorously worn over a white shirt, tuxedos with shiny lapels and white waistcoats, and glittering jackets. Patent leather shoes and bow ties complete the ensembles, while the girls are clad in short black leather dresses.The film’s second part is filmed in colour and is dedicated to sportswear, inspired by “summer, trips and travel.” The focus is on jeans, tracksuits and comfy sweatshirts in bold primary colours, like the one in bright yellow. The collection also includes open-work knitwear, cotton trousers, baggy shorts, sport shirts, lightweight nylon windbreakers and DSquared2’s new take on sailor-stripe tops. As the label concisely put it: “Real everyday wear for real men and women.” Dean Caten had the last word: “It's all truly real. There's no play-acting.”
 In a similar vein, other labels featured a ubiquitous back-to-basics mood. Like Tod’s, whose Creative Director Walter Chiapponi delved into the label's archives to design a pre-collection hinging on a series of evergreen items. Salvatore Ferragamo too chose to plunge into the past, specifically in its Florentine palazzo, charting the label's history with a corporate-style video, showing only glimpses of the pre-collection looks. Neapolitan tailoring label Kiton presented a corporate video too, in which views of the beautiful bay of Naples alternate with images from Kiton’s ateliers.
 Silhouettes with XXL shoulders 

Among the emerging labels presenting on Thursday, Numero 00, Valerio Farina’s street label, showcased a complete collection for next summer, shot around the ancient bridge of Tiberius and the river Marecchia in Rimini, a sea resort on the Adriatic. Sport shirts, shorts, wind-breakers and beige cotton jumpsuits are the staples of Numero 00’s informal style, in which details are all-important.
 
With a futuristic video style at the opposite end of the sensorial spectrum, Danish label Han Kjøbenhavn has envisioned the evolution of humankind, showcasing silhouettes for next summer that notably incorporate XXL, seemingly helium-inflated shoulders. Suit jackets sport power shoulders, and zipped gilets share the same ballooning, life-jacket-style look.Broad-shouldered raincoats and maxi overcoats are cinched at the waist, for a cassock effect. Leather and silicone abound in the garments, as well as in the accessories, like the fairy-tale boots. The girls wear long, slinky bodycon dresses.  
The rest of the day was dedicated to cruise collections by several womenswear labels, like Simona Marziali-MRZ, Philosophy by Lorenzo Serafini, Ermanno Scervino and San Andrès Milano. The latter unveiled a capsule collection designed for both men and women, with models of either sex clad in frilled shirts and wearing pearl earrings.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 17, 2020","Milan's Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (The National Chamber for Italian Fashion), the non-profit that works to promote and develop the Italian fashion industry, has entered into a new strategic partnership with Los Angeles-based wholesale e-commerce platform, NuOrder.As part of the partnership, NuOrder will use its platform to support the CNMI's emerging designers showcase beginning this September. The showcase will feature up-and-coming designers chosen by the CNMI, and comes as part of the organization's commitment to supporting and uplifting young fashion brands. 

According to a press release, the partnership will give these brands free access to NuOrder's B2B-platform for two seasons, and will allow them to use NuOrder’s features – such as digital catalogs, line sheets, 360 imagery and its virtual showroom – to boost their wholesale business.In a statement, NuOrder co-founder and co-chief executive officer, Heath Wells, pointed out the help that digital solutions can bring to fashion brands working through the Covid-19 pandemic. 

“In such a challenging moment for the fashion industry, we are happy to team up with Camera Nazionale della Moda to develop this partnership aimed at supporting and promoting the business of emerging labels,” Wells said. “I think that this pandemic which has shaken the world has really shown us how technology is an essential force for constructive change and progress.”

""Now, more than ever, I think it’s crucial for brands to have all the tools to be competitive on the international scene,"" said CNMI president, Carlo Capasa. 

“We are going through a pretty complicated, challenging moment for the fashion industry and knowing that a leading company like NuOrder is aware of the needs of the emerging designers is a very positive sign which makes me feel even more optimistic about the future of our Made In Italy industry and of Milan as a capital of fashion and luxury.”

Last year, the CNMI launched another project to support upcoming fashion labels, selecting 13 'Made in Italy' brands and giving them the opportunity to showcase and sell their collections at a traveling pop-up shop at Hyundai department stores across Korea.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 17, 2020","Live fashion finally returned to France on Thursday when Simon Porte Jacquemus staged a rather wondrous show where a beautiful cast marched through a giant field of bearded wheat in the Val d’Oise, northwest of Paris.Guests were ferried 90 minutes out of the French capital to a fertile plateau and a thousand-acre field in a historical county known as Vexin. Named after the ancient Gallic tribe who fought Julius Cesar, the Veliocasses, whose name means honest. 
 
Which is what this Jacquemus show was; an idyllic moment where exotic beauties swept through a field that stretched as far as the eye could see, the wind rippling the spikes of wheat behind them. Van Gogh in Vexin, where guests sat on old wooden chairs sunk into the wheat field. The cast first appeared over the crest of the hill, some 300 meters away, then marched before a darkly glorious sunset, along a twisting plywood runway. Similar to the curvaceous clothes, which exposed plenty of skin, in a stellar casting of today’s hippest models. Jacquemus style is certainly not for the faint of heart.
 
Cut with an elongated silhouette with billowing high-waist pants and micro cotton capes, racy bras, or mini boleros with giant puff sleeves. Shapes that recalled a curvy Joan Miró drawing, or an early Karl Blossfeldt plant photo.
 
""I really wanted to work on the draping, and a new sense of proportion,"" added the designer, who spent lockdown in his native Provence.
 
Jacquemus injected all sorts of fine art references into the mix, in a great series of men’s shirts in this coed show: spiky golden Alexander Calder patterns, Jean Lurçat sketches of the sun, even Howard Meister’s famous P-Strut wire chair was worked into a crisp white cotton gent’s shirt. Pencil skirts finished as if by faux spikelets of hulled wheat, which were also used in some cute miniature clutches. 
 
The show was backed up by a soundtrack that included Goran Bregović, and a stupendously impassioned flamenco number by Luz Casal, on speakers hidden deep within the field. All staged before barely 80 guests, including Isabelle Adjani, almost hiding in one of the designer’s huge straw hats. And applauded heartily at the finale, when Jacquemus took a long wave at the very top of the hill. 
""I wanted to be in nature, but not in Provence or down south as I normally do. Near to Paris, given the circumstances,"" explained Jacquemus, who has staged previous shows in a lavender field or on a beach outside Marseille.
 
Catwalk action will return to Paris in late September when major houses will mount fully fledged shows, albeit with reduced numbers due to social distancing. But not Jacquemus, as this was his Spring collection.
 
""My calendar is twice a year, with coed collections. We practiced a slow down in the company, and that is much less exhausting for my team. It’s vital in my view. It breaks the heavy inexorable rhythm of fashion,"" he insisted, before wading into a post-show cocktail, the twilight bathing his guests in the kindest of lights.
 
If you build it, they will come.

"Jul 16, 2020","LINK is pleased to announce the first edition of Art is Hope (from home), a purely digital version of its traditional charity art sale for the benefit of AIDES, the leading association in the fight against AIDS and hepatitis in France and Europe.Due to the current pandemic and global health crisis, LINK has rarely been more mobilized in its long-term fight to stop new HIV infections, as it tries to ensure that a new generation may witness the end of the AIDS epidemic both in France and worldwide.

"Jul 16, 2020","Leave it to Donatella Versace to put the Black Lives Matter movement front and centre in her house’s courageous contribution to Milan Digital Fashion Week on Thursday afternoon.Where other houses have paid lip service to BLM, and several even managed to use all-white casts, Donatella invited the great UK rapper AJ Tracey to stage a livestream  performance in her video clip. And the result was easily the best moment in the inaugural four-day Milan Digital season. Both fashion wise and in terms of keeping Milan relevant in the current global zeitgeist, whose key theme is people’s empowerment.

The house used its time slot in the 43-event season to offer a cunning glimpse of its upcoming Flash Collection, which will be available in shops in August. Filmed on the set of the collection's campaign shoot, the livestream featured AJ Tracey debutting a new track in a world exclusive.Due to the pandemic, the Camera della Moda launched Milan Digital, its first overwhelmingly online fashion season, where all but two shows are video presentations. However, Versace’s decision to stage a livestream gave its presentation infinitely more force.

The action opened with AJ and a friend arriving, head to toe in Versace, at a Milanese photo studio and backstage crammed with racks of clothes which they happily admire. Before cutting to a shoot in a studio, with a quartet of models. A mix of two all-black ensembles and a pair of youths in magnificent prints. One guy in a giant gold Medusa medallion print silk shirt worn with matching shorts and a golf hat, beside a strikingly pretty gal in a super mix of snakeskin pants and marble print tank all accessorized with giant gold hoop earrings and necklace. One stunning blonde in pawn-shaped little black dress dissected by a gold chain belt. Guys in sneakers or bovver boots; gals in wedge sandals or platform army boots.

A clever sneak peek meets backstage access for a runway show that will never take place. At which point Donatella made her entrance in a 'V' logo T-shirt and black jeans, to introduce AJ Tracey to the cast. The blonde bombshell once again showing herself far more instinctively in touch with the mood of our times than so many of her designer colleagues. And maintaining a house tradition began with Gianni of getting star musicians – like Prince or J Lo – to create custom-made soundtracks for their collections.Today, the British artist was attired in denim jacket, pants and hats embossed with electric blue snakeskin, whereupon he debuts his latest track, as a beautiful model appears in a matching outfit to dance sensually around him. In a brilliant performance with an evocative chorus.

“How can I trust these folk who don’t even allow me to breathe?
Get out the numbers, get out the car when I want to see.
I got my first in the air. This night is bigger than me.
I stand with my brothers. You kill all my brothers and beat up on  me.”

AJ Tracey rapping to a sample from Syntouch & Magic Sense’s Just Listen. More of the cast appear; gals in surgically cut pastel cocktails; guys in Miami Vice lilac power suits, as the UK rapper sums up the mood:  “They see my skin and they’re guessing. Just coz I’m black doesn’t mean I’m aggressive.”

At the finale, AJ and buddy depart, obviously proud of their contribution to today’s great debate, and to fashion.

“All people not wearing masks in this video have been tested,” reads the final line in the clip. A video that will surely stand the test of time.

"Jul 15, 2020","Finally, after 15 weeks of runway confinement, Etro staged fashion’s first, proper, live fashion show in Milan on Wednesday before a real – and not virtual – masked audience practising social distancing.The first true live show by a major league brand since Louis Vuitton in Paris back in March 3, Etro unveiled this co-ed, Spring-Summer 2021 collection inside Milan’s most prestigious hotel, the Four Seasons on via Gésu. The models marching on pebbled pathways inside the former cloisters of this 15th century convent.

Like every event in the four-day Milan Digital Fashion Week this season, Etro is available to be seen the web platform of the Camera della Moda, Italian fashion’s governing body. There will only be one other live show in Milan this week: Dolce & Gabbana, at 5.30PM today, out of an online calendar featuring 43 brands.For the opening image, Kean and Veronica could be seen assembling their cast in a circular interior courtyard below the hotel garden, their careful formation emphasized by a rising drone shot.

Right away Etro, very likely the greatest classical print makers in fashion, sent out a patchwork jerkin of temple detail and faded flowers, worn with a tropical tiger in an oasis shirt over faded jeans with turn-ups. Or self-confident menswear chic, that looked to the Wild West for inspiration. The first female model wore an elegiac prairie print governess dress under a suede Comanchero jacket with fringes.

Passing by an audience, spaced one-meter apart and nearly all in masks, that included a Gotha of Milanese fashion editors: Emanuele Farneti, Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Italia; Andrea Tenerani, the city’s most in-demand men’s stylist, and the UK’s man in the Italian capital, Luke Leitch. All perched underneath looming white parasols in the hotel garden.For guys, there were urban jungle, Prince of Wales, single-breasted jackets; off-beat, paisley deconstructed suits; and a Rockstar suit in a jungle print. Presented to live classical music played by the Ensemble Testori Orchestra, directed by Giulia Sandoli, and including cello, contrabass, piano and a quartet of violins, playing a perfect selection of music by the late, great Ennio Morricone, climaxing with an emotional rendition of his marvellous soundtrack for Once Upon a Time in the West.

“We are finally back together, in the garden of this iconic hotel, in the heart of Milan’s Montenapoleone district. We want to highlight that we are a family, that Etro is a family living in a world of joie de vivre, color and positivity. This season, we want to bring to the stage real clothes for real people, discovering a new authenticity. Just what we like, what we think is absolutely relevant, what makes us feel good. Nothing more than this,” explained Kean and Veronica Etro, the house’s brother and sister designers.

For socializing: Navajo pattern cashmere knit cardigan; excellent safari jackets in a quirky beige Ikat and a remarkable leather jerkin done with a beautiful Nevada desert image – Butch Cassidy at a Taos gallery opening. Lots of natty, striped shirts finished by photo of big cats, with an ecological element. Shirts made in eucalyptus yarns and polos of fabrics culled from recycled plastic bottles.

Women in lace barn dance dresses; denim micro shorts and jackets in marbled intarsia and a super suit combo in the garden tiger print seen on guys. Though the Etro cowgirl is not above a stop in Nepal, to pick up embroidered belts and charming silk bandit shirts; marching like their boyfriends with totes and weekend bags as if checking into the hotel. All wearing the snappy new Etro x Carrera sunglasses, riffing on the eyewear brand’s iconic Champion aviators though in Etro hues of bitter lemon, deep red and girly pink.

All told, ideal clothes to make a brilliant first impression when you arrive at a summer villa for a weekend. No wonder Kean and Veronica looked so proud when they took their bow. They had every right to be.

"Jul 14, 2020","The British Fashion Council has announced that London Fashion Week September will run from 17- 22 September with a combination of digital activations and physical events.The biannual showcase will feature both womenswear and menswear in a gender-neutral proposition that builds on the BFC’s digital-only June showcase.

The newly relaunched Londonfashionweek.co.uk digital platform will continue to host “exclusive multimedia content” from leading designer brands. And all content will be available to both a consumer and trade audience, further expanding London Fashion Week’s direct-to-consumer focus.A provisional schedule will be announced later in the summer.

Milan Fashion Week is also expected to go ahead as a physical event this September, as well as Paris Fashion Week. A return date for New York Fashion Week is a little more uncertain, with the CFDA saying it is “currently reviewing all upcoming important dates”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 13, 2020","Abbie Hoffmann named his revealing autobiography of political agitation in the 1960s 'Soon to be A Major Motion Picture,' a good title for the last day of the debut Paris Menswear season on Monday.An entirely online experience, due the pandemic, the season ended up being as much a festival of indie filmmakers and mini showreels for young directors as it was an actual fashion week. Then again, that was not such a bad thing, provided one is certain that the next fashion seasons will feature actual runway shows. All the chatter pre-season predicting that the world’s great fashion weeks in London, Milan, New York and Paris will all take place on the web in future turned out to be a lot of hot air. It’s very fundamental -- fashion needs to be experienced live. Period.

The day began with Lanvin, whose video was named Le Palais Idéal, and shot in a bizarre grotto created by naïve artist Ferdinand Cheval. A postman inspired by postcards of the Paris Expositions of his era, Cheval built the structure over 40 years with his own hands. Hyper stylized architecture inspired by everything from a Bavarian castle to a Rajasthan palace, with oddly gritty comical statues of Cesar, Vercingetorix and Archimedes.An ideal setting for this powerful co-ed collection that included pale blue '60s lapel-free jackets; Mod reefer coats; Battleship Potemkin sailor’s blouses for guys and great frilly polka dot dresses; kimono cable knits; Juliette Greco existentialist leather trenches for gals.  Adding to the drama, the house’s creative director even proposed a Cat Bag, inspired by the chimney by Alvar Aalto’s Art Deco fireplace for Jeanne Lanvin, with an enamel hand with crystal details.

“I want Lanvin to incarnate a more dramatic and cinematic version of each person. Being the character of your dreams,” explained Sialelli, a Marseille-born creator creating in Paris, in an interview with the new fashionista of Canal + Camille Charrière. One of a half dozen by the completely bilingual Charrière that appeared on the smartly revamped web platform of the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine, which oversees the menswear season in Paris.
Asked what he most missed during lockdown, Sialelli replied: ""Dancing and dance moves… I think it’s important to not over intellectualize the creative process.”All told, there were 18 events on Monday, out of a total of 67 brands on the official calendar.

Bored youth looking beautiful at We11done, the Korean street wear label. Arguably the season’s strongest cast – all lying around a retro modernist loft that looked culled from a photoshoot in Wallpaper*. In Hugh Hefner pyjamas and oversized Percy Shelley blouses for guys; and giant sleeved crisp wool coats and Mary Quant frocks for gals. Plus, it had the single best image of the season – a golden eagle incongruously perched on a nest of a dozen red security cameras.

A mock trailer from Phipps, “coming next spring,” as the cast lived out the fantasy of appearing in an actual motion picture entitled 'Spirit of Freedom.' Set in today’s Wild West with John Ford landscapes and David Lynch dive bars, the first line is a wonderfully deadpan. “Have you seen Phipps?” one tenderfoot youth asks a gnarly old timer. Responds the gravel-voiced narrator: “But how do you find a man who doesn’t want to be found?” The clothes felt secondary but were still pretty darn good – stars and stripes cowboy shirts; tough-guy windowpane-check coats and tremendous wild cat-print tops, seen before enormous vistas. If only Henry Hathaway had had a drone…

In a technologically driven season the brand that best used technology was probably White Mountaineering, with their Cad Cam cutting opening: techy telephoto lens images; industrial soundtrack and cast of models marching at angles to the viewer. Which made it easy to admire the voluptuously cut three-piece suits; fluid cabans: multi-zip parkas and tough chic fly fisherman vests. Pretty well everything in black, and pretty well everything hyper wearable. Commercial, calculated and cunning in the best possible sense of those terms. A top-notch display by designer Yosuke Aizawa and full marks to Daito Manabe for the movie direction.All shows are available for viewing on fhcm.com, the swish new platform of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body. And many come in the Vimeo format, like a moody tale by Palomo Spain, the conceptual couturier, whose Spanish-language clip, Rehearsal, was way too dark and overly long. His bar jacket meets Costa del Sol playboy in black and white check and sizzling black silk suits did have plenty of punch. But compared to his often-brilliant installations inside the Spanish embassy of Paris during the women’s season this felt like small potatoes, or rather tiny croquetas.

Dunhill’s choice was a “public information film” with archive footage from a 1970s ad; with runway footage of recent shows to provide a little tongue in cheek branding. Which felt, well, rather lazy.

Finally, even given that it was a spring-summer season, one has rarely seen so much skin in a fashion week. Like at Ludovic de Saint Sernin, which was essentially one dude in a white leather zippered jockstrap swimming trunks scooping another young lad on a pebbly beach.

Or, for instance at Thom Browne, where his video was of a demi-clad black gentleman, the self-recorded singer Moses Sumney, wearing just a white sequined sarong and earphones. Hard to form much of an opinion about this collection, but one could easily speculate about Thom Browne’s future cinematic plans.

"Jul 12, 2020","Now that’s how a brand should use digital to great effect in fashion. After a week of grumbling by pretty much everyone in the fashion industry about the predictability of the online season for couture and menswear, along comes Loewe to rip up the internet rules and create a 24-hour web happening. 
Described as a ""show-in-a-box,"" the Spanish marque’s creative director Jonathan Anderson delivered a substantial series of elaborate files in a fancy box to editors and VIPs pre-show to set the agenda.
 
All unveiled over 24 hours via film, video clips, musical interludes, piano and harp performances, basket weaving tutorials, celebrity interviews, and even breakfast, lunch – with five textile artists – and dinner, all under the rubric, #loewess21. Hourly for 24 hours. It opened with ""The Front Row,"" portraits in motion by Aidan Zamiri, a group of cool kids wearing the actual Spring/Summer 2001 menswear collection everywhere – from riding what looked like a Vespa in Ibiza or  visiting the Palais de Tokyo, to snorkeling in the deep blue, or strolling through a bamboo park with a basketball in hand. Ragged trimmed denim jackets, pink dandy cotton suits and Anderson’s signature patchwork tartan shirts all looked great. 
 
The whole concept was even charming at its most wantonly self-indulgent – like a rambling description of the soundtrack by Adam Bainbridge standing in a garden, who then wanders off underneath a tree. That segued into a performance by Korean composer Park Jiha, on some sort of Asian vibes and a saenghwang multi-tube wind instrument. Doleful rather than dulcet in lockdown. 
Next we had the art or shibori, or Japanese cotton dyeing, explained by a master practitioner Kayo Ando, who divulged – in Japanese – that it actually began in India 1,300 years ago. 

All the way to a Paper Engineering class by Shina Tanaka. Miniature Pop Art structures which he cut into their final shape with extreme dexterity. Notably a series of pineapples, which again referenced one of Loewe’s new creations: a pineapple bag in woven leather, in yellow and green, ""classicism with humor.""  
 
Conversations too, in Spanish without subtitles, with basket weaving artist Idoia Cuesta, whose ideas were incorporated into a brilliant new creation in stiff leather; a lobster pot-meets-medieval bodice.
 
All that even before breakfast, when Jonathan met actor Josh O’Connor, best know for the The Durrels and playing Prince Charles in The Crown.
 
""I’ve been doing shows for 10 years and I found it way more therapeutic to do it in a box,"" conceded Anderson, who asked French art directors M&M to create the portable dossier. 
We finally got to the designer's introduction of the actual collection at noon. In Anderson’s words it was all about working sculpturally during lockdown, when he wanted everyone to work with their hands, in his case even baking bread.
 
""The key silhouettes this season have been about volume,"" he said, showing a striking trench coat ballooned up by a giant pod-shaped back; or a smooth grand ecru gent’s coat fronted by a massive black circle. All the way to a bravura needle-point jacket inspired by Paul Cadmus, whose painting had been translated into a tapestry.
 
Many of the ideas were also presented in his Loewe box of files, where reviewers and friends could work with their hands building mini copies of these looks in stiff paper cutouts. 
 
A different take on the approach that he used at his own brand, JW Anderson, where 10 days before, he also sent a dossier of ideas – from sketches to dried flowers – before talking his fans through that collection in a web presentation.
 
In a word, a 360 designer operating on multiple levels – engaging his audience in his collection as much as possible in the midst of a pandemic. And doing so on his own terms.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 12, 2020","We know this was a purely digital menswear season in Paris, but it was nice to see a designer attempt to put on something close to a show. 
In effect, the digital ""show"" of Sunday on the official calendar of the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine was very much ""The Horsepower Takeaway"" from Denmark’s Henrik Vibskov. Henrik’s inspiration came from fire; his vision was about renewal, and the results was dark yet glorious. Blooming flower-prints suits in recycled polyester and organic cotton; erratic ink-dyed work shirts; and muddy prints that looked melted together. Unlike nearly every other designer in this five-day season that ends on Monday, Vibskov actually walked and talked the audience through his line-up, before the entire cast appeared before a giant brick wall at the Carlsberg Foundation – on which models perched on huge rocking chairs in a memorable finale.
 
Paris will always love a rookie, and the big calendar debut of the day was from KidSuper, by designer Colm Dillane. ""People say the fashion world is filled with fakes and plastic people, well we proved them wrong. Thanks Paris,"" said a virtual Dillane at the end of his video, entitled ""Everything’s Fake until it's Real."" A proper performance piece with a cast composed of male dolls, marching stiffly on a tiny catwalk before a stony-eyed front row of dolls, including a very waxy Anna Wintour. A collection composed of rock star concert gear – with dressing gowns in a cool human chain print, graphic graffiti mural coats, and a great red suit embellished with giant mouths. Way too much maybe, but what a great step in Europe for KidSuper.The big star of Sunday was Kolor, from the hipster Japanese designer Junichi Abe. he went for a slow-motion video of somersaulting models, shot in a concrete loft. Brilliant intercutting of tailoring and street style; style sampling at the max and coolly handled asymmetry. Few designers anywhere are kickier than Junichi, who backed up his ideas with some sensational Asian rock – ""Smoke and Mirrors"" by Kikgaku Moyo.
 
Yoshio Kubo set his performance in a classic Japanese timber villa. An ideal setting for his languid style – billowing silk shirts, layered trenches, soft military patch pocket shirts, with the phrase ""Think Before Wear."" Padded traditional kimono jackets, some wonderfully sleek haori jackets and uber-chill priestly redingotes worn with kasa hats made this a charismatic style statement.
 
The day opened with Auralee, and pretty boys and gals marching onto the disused industrial jetty of a city port, as a passenger plane landed before a bleak gray sky. The clothes were monocolor too: faded rose jumpsuits or worn-out Prussian gray dusters for guys and off-white linen pantsuits for the gals in this coed show. 
Arthur Avellano called his video ""Origins,"" and there was lots of flesh and skin and smooching to indicate what sort of origin he had in mind. Multiple latex jackets over floral shirts on boys and gals, most of whom spent their time dreamily looking into each other’s eyes. As a matter of fact, there was five times as much flesh as fabric in this showing.
 
Namacheko from Belgium set its statement on a sandy beach and lakeside, the better to show off his knits and the squiggly Aboriginal patterns which the two models painted on each other’s torsos. Quite what was the point was hard to discern.
 
Facetasm took us to an underground parking lot to shoot its assemblage arty sportswear, graphic tracksuits, faux football scarves and high-tech sneakers, before emerging into garden sunlight beneath Tokyo Tower and better illuminating its wares. On a good day, Facetasm’s Hiromichi Ochiai is a great designer, but this season he definitely does not merit a fashionable cigar for this effort.
 
Archie Alled-Martinez, an LVMH Young Graduate prize winner in 2018, produced a cheapo wee video with lots of crotch shots of a scrawny model who eventually strips off to his Y-fronts. And that’s about it.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 11, 2020","The Paris menswear season was all about Asian influences with a quartet of designers from that continent making dramatic stylistic statements on Saturday, the mid-point of the first ever season for men’s fashion entirely shown online. A day where, even if individual designers did not produce volumes of fashion news, many certainly provided a platform for a new gang of youthful filmmakers with novel visions. 
 
Brilliant black and white graphics at Juun.J, whose hipster pop star combat uniforms looked great marching across the urban jungle of Seoul. Before rush-hour sunsets, the brand’s meeting of ceremonial dress, samurai shapes, dandy construction and heroic attitude made this a standout collection. Shot with a hundred shades of gray, like an early Wim Wenders film, this was the video and show of the day and, in its sobriety, was totally in synch with the wary mood of 2020. No wonder they called the clip ""SeoulSoul.""Maison Mihara Yasuhiro has always been a great individualist designer. His online event opened with a puppet waking in a loft bedroom and then going to a fashion show in the Palais de Tokyo. What followed was a standard runway format with great deconstructed knits and grandfather shirts; hand-painted safaris; streaky putty-colored Mackintoshes and graphic logo bowling shirts. Assemblage coed fashion at its most out there and all the better for that.
 
Li-Ning, China’s single most influential menswear marque, was founded by a legendary gymnast of the same name. He leapt to world fame by winning six gold medals in the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984, the first in which China had participated since it became the People’s Republic. In case you had forgotten, his brand Li-Ning put up a video clip that began with his flawless performance on the rings, and ends with fans waving a huge Chinese five-star flag in the stands. In between we had images of his recent show in Paris; and lots of shots of his mash-up of active sports gear and street style logos.

One can only admire Li Ning’s remarkable sporting skill and success in building a major global brand – and enjoy his sneaker collabs with such greats as Dwyane Wade and Stefano Pilati. However, coming at the end of a week where mainland Chinese communists have imposed a draconian security law in Hong Kong to suffocate democracy and impose authoritarian one-party rule, this flag waving video came across as cheap propaganda. Which is what it was.
 
Li-Ning’s final tag line was ""the past fuels the future."" In Hong Kong today it is the past that threatens to steal the future. 
From Japan, Teppei Fujita from Sulvam emphasized his poetic style and intricate construction by focusing on pairs of models in a coed show. Each standing, or lying, underneath an urban flyover and highway, with traffic whistling by – in transparent greatcoats, frayed jackets with angled pockets, and camouflage silk military jackets assembled with layers of contrasting chiffon. ""Cutting equals pattern making, compile these elements of color and fabrics, makes magic happen,"" intones Fujita in English, describing his creations aptly. 
 
The French did play more than a bit role on Saturday, though. 
 
The day’s big debut was meant to have been the first menswear-only runway show by Isabel Marant, but once this became a digital season, she changed gears like everyone else. In her case, this involved showing a video set inside the Centre National de la Danse, a monumental building recently revamped by two young architects – Antoinette Robain and Claire Guieysse. Beige jumpsuits, rainbow-hued mohair sweaters, ikat bomber jackets and kicky logo tops. The clothes evoked that cool meeting of French style and American optimism that is the DNA of Marant, the most successful new French fashion house of this past decade. 
 
Also notable was Davi Paris, whose insouciant romp under the white cliffs of Normandy was beautifully shot. Ideal for highlighting a great collection of fresh summer wear – prairie flower shirts, romantic rocker jeans, orchid-print jerkins and clinging knits with twig patterns. All directed skilfully by Van Mossevelde + N, definitely a director to watch.  
 
Flat-stomached youth around a suburban pool at Swedish-German house Lazoschmidl in a neat little video entitled Margarita from one Johan von Reybekiel, with great music by Carl Hjelm Sandqvist. An ace opening model, in Friesian cow-print swimming togs; micro swimsuits with big butterfly-print fronts; the very occasional sweatshirt, floral shirts and a scrawny youth emerging from the pool in wonderful jeans finished in rose petals, all styled with a neat light touch by Emma Thorstrand.
 
A classical French house, Francesco Smalto, showed the spirit of tailoring in movement. Chalk stripe pantsuits worn with sneakers and wide-legged, pleated trousers worn on two dancers who soared and slid around a marvelous soaring French salon in a fine city square, or skipped around the side streets of the Palais de Tokyo. Shawl-collar chic along the Seine’s 19th-century Passerelle Debilly, shot by Jason Last with some wonderful dancing courtesy of two dancers and choreographers, Ablaye Diop and étoile Germain Louvet, all with splendid musical accompaniment from Nicolas Leau.
 Casablanca, the French party label, set its video on a faux seashore, featuring models emoting in windowpane check suits, Miami Vice shirts, great tops with tropical fruit prints or images of high divers and tennis stars. Casablanca’s French-Moroccan founder Charaf Tajer clearly enjoys himself creating and these clothes will be worn to celebrate life. He is the Maghreb’s answer to Tommy Hilfiger, whose cast finished the video by getting into a Porsche Targa with a surfboard on top.
 
Those who yearn for modernist tailoring should look to Aldo Maria Camillo, even if he used his time slot on the calendar for a black and white indie Nouvelle Vague mini flick. Precious little clothes, but some moody branding, which of course is half of what this whole digital season is all about.
 
Doublet's contribution starred an urban bear who loves Christmas, with fur made up of colorful crocheted octagons. A bear who was also a fine seamstress, stitching and sewing a whole series of outfits and wrapping them in gold wrapping paper for Yuletide. The cast were the gift recipients, wearing their presents – party clothes and even the outfits for a transgressive wedding, where the bear saved the day by finding the wedding ring. Quite frankly, even at one’s most generous, this was a lame home movie.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 10, 2020","Video may have killed the radio star, but on the reaction to the first ever digital Paris fashion week, the queens of the catwalk can breathe easy.Forced online for the first time in its history by the coronavirus pandemic, brands both in haute couture and the Paris men's fashion week presented videos of their collections instead.

Whle some had seen this as the advent of a long overdue opening up the cliquish salons of the fashion elite to the masses, the digital revolution has somewhat fallen flat.""The runway can't reopen for business soon enough,"" quipped Bridget Foley of the industry bible Women's Wear Daily, who like many felt the online shows -- which end Monday -- lack the buzz and razzamatazz of the real thing.

""Oh Lord, how pretentious are some of these film shorts,"" she wrote. ""This digital fashion week is making the live show model feel plenty relevant, and even essential.""

Front row fixture Diane Pernet was not impressed by the early offerings either.

""I am sorry, I think they can do more,"" the Paris-based American critic and curator told AFP.

""I am all into digital, but it is not doing it for me,"" she added.

But Laurent Coulier, head men's buyer for top French department stores Galeries Lafayette and BHV Marais, could see upsides.

""The great advantage for us compared to a normal fashion week is the time we save,"" he told AFP.No more mad rushRather than the mad race across the French capital from one show to the next ""we can see them all every half hour online. Sometimes in a normal fashion week with the transport and meetings, it is difficult to get a global view of what is going on.""

He also liked how some labels, like Y/Project and the young Paris brand Egon Lab had used their films creatively to show the uniqueness of their clothes.

Coulier said the films were very useful calling cards ""giving us a good view of brands that we have not been working with already... so we can go and see them in their showrooms.""

Still even he admitted digital lacked the magic of a live show.

On the vexed question whether he would buy a collection on the back of an online show alone, Coulier was more careful.

""You can see how the garments hang and fall, but with digital you cannot touch or feel the material... that's what it lacks.""

Pernet cannot see fashion shows being rendered obsolete, ""and I am not one of those people who cry at shows,"" she said.

The the digital revolution has already happened to some degree, she argued. ""We have had live streaming of shows for five years now at least there is lots of digital showrooms.""Digital: 'Light years to go'As for the designers themselves, Berluti's Kris Van Assche told AFP that you can't beat the drama and adrenaline of the runway.

""I really love the emotion of the show, the history you can tell with the place you hold it in, the music and the people"" who come.

""But there is one thing in a fashion show you can't do, and that is to press pause and explain where things come from.""

Van Assche said this was ""a once in a lifetime opportunity"" to give people the background of how he worked on his collection with the American ceramicist Brian Rochefort.

Even so, Foley said that early signs ""indicate that digital has a long way to go -- light years -- before it can replace the live fashion event.""

While she admitted that with the extraordinary circumstances labels did not have long to prepare themselves, she still found the digital experience lacking.

And that included acclaimed Italian director Matteo Garrone's lavish film for Dior haute couture -- which clocked up nearly 3.5 million Instagram views even as it was criticised for its lack of diversity in casting.

""Exquisite"" as it was, Foley said, ""the film veered toward fashion satire"".

While others noted that the quality of the digital shows improved in the men's collections -- with heavyweights Louis Vuitton, Dries Van Noten and Rick Owens debuting their offerings Friday -- Foley said that for her, the digital experience did not have the ""enjoyable intimacy of actually 'being there'.""

There was one thing, however, that Coulier, Pernet and New York Times critic Vanessa Friedman all agree on -- digital has cracked fashion show's eternal tardiness problem.

""I'll say one thing... you don't have to sit there for the usual 20-30 minutes twiddling your thumbs and waiting for them to start,"" Friedman tweeted.

"Jul 10, 2020","There’s been much about the marriage of fashion and fine art at the Paris Fashion Week Menswear, the first purely online season in the history of menswear. Fashion is ultimately an applied art, but its distance from fine art has rarely looked shorter than in this series of digital presentations.Consider Berluti, whose contribution to the season was an insightful Zoom conversation between its designer Kris Van Assche and the ceramic artist Brian Rochefort, focused on the power and influence of color; and how the French brand employed artist Rochefort’s artistic hues in its spring summer collection. Showing images of Rochefort’s dramatic bowls and sculpture; as he narrated how he gets the maximum effect from any pigment by trying dozens of glazes and textures.

“That totally relates to what we do with patina. A brown is never going to just be a brown but an accumulation of 25 shades of brown,” notes Van Assche.Rochefort’s globular sculptures look like futurist alien organs with lunar textures; volcanic eruptions or cylindrical vessels completed in crackled Technicolor rocks. Which Van Assche skillfully incorporates into the most beautiful shirts of the Paris season. Even fusing the artist’s cracked finishes into a new Berluti shoe.

Van Assche’s first collaboration since joining Berluti two years ago, the results looked splendid with the new languid suit that Kris has made his signature at the house.

“I think the art audiences needs some cheering up in these times. People are inundated with all sort of crazy information form social media.  Sometimes it’s best to just tune out a little and enjoy the celebration of color and excitement in art works, rather than the depressing concept behind come contemporary art,” concludes Rochefort.

Issey Miyake’s choice of artist was a trio of dancers, who pirouetted around in some great Homme Plissé deconstructed jackets; drawstring pants; and shorts in some dazzling combinations of salamander orange; ultraviolet orchid; amethyst and streaky anthracite.  The sheer exuberance of the dancers underlying the malleability and ease of the collection with the season’s best color palette. No wonder they named it Meet Your New Self. Breezily written and directed by Japanese actor Yusuke Kobayashi it ended with a whole host of characters wearing the clothes in multiple locations worldwide.Few designers have dressed as many artists as Japanese master Yohji Yamamoto, who concentrated on actually showing his latest collection, even printing fabric mixes besides looks in his dark video. Moody melancholic music for his posh militarism and divinely embroidered Tencel, triacetate and polyester coats all finished oval-shaped buttons with all-seeing eyes. And, of course, a great mordant version of walking blues. Yohji can still cut like surgeon, and when the mood takes him, strum like Neil Young.

Rick Owens took the simplest option, but sometimes they are the best. Just a couple of parallel camera views of him in the midst of a series of fittings with the same sculpted-bod, blond male model; with white noise and industrial sounds churning as background. Social distancing fittings for the summer of 2020. Hard to tell much about the clothes, but the pair clearly enjoyed each other’s company.

Cool T.M, the indie French label, took the novel approach of sending senior editors 3D viewers, into which one inserted one’s mobile phone, in order to mimic a virtual reality experience of their collection – sort of.  On the actual Federation website one got a better view of the tartan mafia shirts; cocktail hour rocker suits; checked cardigans; oversized trenches worn by boys and gals - all shown in a trashy old warehouse. A loosely enforced social-distancing-free zone, which suddenly became a Miami nightclub worthy of Tony Montana.The big surprise was the posh rock 'n' roll aesthetic of Amiri. From American Iranian designer Mike Amiri, whose blend of retro Steve McQueen glam, Bjorn Borg sportswear and off duty basketball attitude all combined to make a strong statement. His video, Welcome Home, did have a text that was, however, cringeworthy, a never ending series of obsequious compliments from fashionistas and retailers. But the actual look of the city; detailing shots of the collection, looked great, while his voice was smooth as tequila sunrise at sunset on Sunset Boulevard.

Ernest W Baker, which despite its name hails from Portugal, and is designed by Reid Baker and partner Ines Amorim, had the most charming contribution. For their official Paris debut they produced a joyful video with old Super 8 family footage of their ancestor, Ernest W. Baker Jr, who was born in 1926.

“I’ve some wonderful children and great grandchildren. So, life’s been pretty darn good to me,” comments the gent, before we witness a shaggy haired “grandson” parading around a nostalgic coastline in modish suits; Elvis shirts and natty blazers.

Nostalgia was also a recurrent theme at Uniforme, whose founders Hugues Fauchard and Rémi Bats referenced their contrasting youth, one in the scouts – sometimes seen in France as preparatory schools of Catholic conservatism. But which fondly recalled in their video for the sense of “fellowship, peer support, sharing,” and love of uniforms. The actual clothes were nostalgic too, albeit with a 2020 twist, like the coolest pleated white safari shorts worn by a handsome black model.

They named their plaintive video 'Be Prepared.' Ironic, perhaps, since last month saw calls for the removal in Poole, England, of a statue to the scouts’ founder, Robert Baden-Powell for being homophobic and pro-fascist. Baden-Powell’s motto was To Be Prepared.

"Jul 10, 2020","Birkenstock has revealed that a footwear collection designed by Central Saint Martins fashion students will launch in stores and online next February.The initiative is part of a long-term collaboration with the prestigious London college involving BA Fashion History & Theory and MA Fashion students.

The German footwear brand said the project started in 2018, when it commissioned the BA Fashion History & Theory course to research and enrich its archive. Core elements of Birkenstock’s history were identified across various research trips to its headquarters in Germany, allowing students to capture the German company’s heritage.The result of this research translated into a second project, with MA Fashion students invited to interpret the brand’s classic style in their contemporary way.

A jury of 12 industry leaders led by Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert, MA Fashion Course Director Fabio Piras and fashion critic Sarah Mower selected a shortlist of 10 finalists. Finally, four winning designs will go into production, launching in select stores worldwide and on 1774.com from February 2021.

“Investing in and connecting with future talents is working with free spirits. A priority for forward thinking brands, especially a democratic brand that embraces all like Birkenstock. The students showed a genuine understanding of design and delivered a convincing end result,” said Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert.

“Working with Birkenstock has been an incredibly gratifying experience for all our students involved in this collaborative project. Four were selected as the winning team and now see their design ideas taken into production and communicated across the brand’s global retail network,” added Fabio Piras, Course Director, MA Fashion.

“As a course director, I want my students to think that their being creative is what gives them commercial potential. I am very grateful to Birkenstock for their exceptional commitment in supporting fashion education in practice with this rewarding opportunity.” 

The collection will be supported by a campaign that will be shot by photographer Walter Pfeiffer in Paris. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 10, 2020","After London and Paris, it's Milano Digital Fashion Week's turn to hit the catwalk, taking on a hybrid format that mixes digital and physical elements. From Tuesday 14 July to Friday 17, some 37 brands will unveil their menswear collections for Spring/Summer 2021, with around a dozen presentations being shown per day. Fashion will also take over the streets of the Lombard capital, with videos that being projected on giant screens in the city's major squares and avenues. 
 As in London and Paris, the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) has created a digital platform offering a range of different content, thanks to the support of Accenture, Microsoft and PwC, as well as an international partnership with The New York Times. Along with the official calendar of video presentations made by brands, visitors to the platform will also be able to access different pages or ""rooms"".
 
There will be ""thematic rooms"" devoted to cultural and digital personalities, an ""institutional room"" featuring interviews with businessmen, and two spaces dedicated to emerging design: the ""International Hub Market"" and ""Together for Tomorrow."" Each brand will also have its own digital showroom, accessible via the CNMI platform. MSGM kicks off the proceedings on Tuesday, an opening day the high points of which include the Prada, Moschino and Philipp Plein shows. Wednesday will feature the only two shows set to actually take place in a physical format, with a handful of guests, while also being live streamed online. 

At 10.00 AM, Etro will unveil its menswear collection and its womenswear pre-collection for Summer 2021 at the prestigious Four Seasons Hotel right in the centre of Milan, while Dolce & Gabbana will bring the day's events to a close at 05.30 PM, with a show hosted in the gardens of Humanitas University. 

Thursday will see shows from big names such as Ferragamo (01.00 PM), Tod's and Dsquared2, while on Friday, the last day, Gucci will present its ""Epilogue"" at 02.00 PM, concluding the reflection on the ritual of the runway that it began last season. Following this digital performance, it will fall to Ermenegildo Zegna and Missoni to close Milan's first menswear fashion week. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 9, 2020","Finally, after a three-day digital Paris haute couture season – where one got to see surprisingly few clothes – the menswear season opened in the French capital on Thursday, with lots and lots of stimulating new fashion. And one really great Paris debut from fledgling house EGONlab, which highlighted the overall mood of tailored artiness.Where many couture houses concentrated on mood pieces and quick teasers, menswear designers created full-blown videos with complete collections, shot with panache and featuring spanking new soundtracks. Shazam recognized few of the video soundtracks on Thursday, also opening day of the five-day and 68-brand French menswear season.
 
The day began with prodigious  panache from Etudes, by the inventive trio of Aurélien Arbet, Jérémie Egry and José Lamali.  One extended, 11-minute tracking shot through Paris - verdant alleys; gritty cobblestone stairways; disused railway tracks or graffitied tower-blocks were filmed in the hilly north of the capital. Shot by Indie filmmaker Grégoire Dyer à la Orson Welles in the 20th arrondissement, for a collection entitled Yes Future.Opening with oversized white laboratory coats and followed by voluminous parkas; striped shirts with Keith Haring images; acid-dyed denim pants; and crisp, pale grey wool boxy suits worn with bovver boots. Plus, some great patchwork shirts of photos of birds and sunsets, taken from images by Roe Etheridge. Who, in turn, shot the look-book of the collection. In a word, arty street wear shot by an art photographer. All told, a thoroughly smart way to use digital media to present a collection.
 
One also got to witness some great cricket stripe blazers and linen suits from CMMN SWDN, whose video was shot inside an all-white studio dissected by bales of straw. Add in dandified, leather, second-skin shirts with Kurbits floral prints culled from Swedish artist Carl Larsson and varsity dressing gowns for a cool style statement for summer. All inspired by the time by husband and wife designers Saif and Emma – spent in lockdown inside a cottage on the Swedish coast.
 
Full marks to EGONlab for a first-rate video, named Renewal and shot in collaboration with Kisol. Based in the Marais, EGONlab is one of the most interesting new labels in Paris, one of those who merge utility clothes, military detailing and punchy graphics to great effect. Their debut presentation on the official Paris schedule – which they called The Myth of Renewal – had a fine, utopian air – and starred sculpted matinée idol tuxedos; survivalist harness waistcoats; strict hunting jackets and Arcadian print shirts. EGONlab also collaborated with Sergio Tacchini, with jokey sweatshirts and baseball jackets finished with cat cartoons. A marque with real design chops and street cred’. Expect to hear lots more about EGONlab and their two creators – Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix. Talk about a great first appearance!
 The morning ended with Wooyoungmi. The talented Korean, however, presented a rather modest video of long-haired youth marching around a red-walled stage or standing on chairs. Featuring double-breasted, fine wool suits; patch pocket men's denim cargo pants and off-kilter, A-line dresses or khaki army shirts for gals, the overall effect looked far too modest. Back to the digital drawing board for Wooyoungmi.
 
Inclusivity was the theme at Blue Marble with a mixed cast of posh, hippie skateboarders shot in and around Paris. Where one could witness great tie-dye Henleys; gutsy track pants; matelassé coats and sensational silk shirts in prints worthy of Mati Kareen. All ending with a march down to a lakeside marina, which felt like a triumph. Modern, psychedelic chic at its most appealing.
 
Ironically, it was left to the day’s biggest star designer – Jonathan Anderson - to show the only teaser. Or, rather, a “photobook” of the Spring/Summer collection he had already unveiled last week online, from his London studio in his “Show in a Box” on July 2. Today’s 35 seconds, instead, consisted of handsome, shirtless, curly-haired artist Carlos Maria Romero lying on top of a series of images. Patiently pinning the photos, fabric swatches, sketches and dried flowers into his own personal order. All of them taken from the boxes that JW Anderson had mailed to editors and VIPs the previous week. Confusing, yes, but kind of cool too.

"Jul 9, 2020","Jacquemus has announced plans to stage an actual live runway show in a secret Paris location next week, making it the first physical catwalk event in the city since lockdown. 
One of France’s most watched young designers, Simon Porte Jacquemus broke the news on his Instagram account. His show will be the first live catwalk display since Louis Vuitton back on March 3 inside the Louvre with the final show of the Paris season.
 
“I’m happy to announce our new collection and show “L’amour,” the designer wrote on his Instagram post, which included a series of three photos – a set of four leather key chains with leather keys; a Jacquemus picnic plate and heart cut out of a jute tablecloth.
 
Subsequently, the designer’s publicist released a statement explaining that this spring-summer 2021 collection will be shown” at the end of the day on Thursday, June 16th 2020 with a very limited number of guests, in full respect of Covid sanitary rules.”
 
The show is expected to have an audience of less than 100 guests and be staged in the countryside outside of Paris. A naturally brilliant showman, Jacquemus’ show in June 2019 inside a lavender field in Provence, where models marched on a giant pink fabric catwalk, generated enormous social media excitement.Born in Salon-de-Provence, Jacquemus is such a fan of this native region he even opened up two restaurants in Galeries Lafayette Champs-Elysées, offering sea-inspired dishes and seafood with Mediterranean flavors.
 
“A year ago we decided to slow down our cycle by showing womenswear and menswear together in January and June. This allows us to reduce the number of shows, mutualize fabrics for menswear and womenswear and slower the pace for my team and partners. More than a creative choice, it’s a sustainable model we believe in and that works for us,” added Jacquemus on Instagram.

"Jul 9, 2020","Few fashion organizations have had a busier spring than the Fédération de la Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body. It oversees six major runway seasons every year in Paris, balancing the demands of giant houses, ambitious new talent and some immense designer egos to create coherent calendars for Haute Couture, women’s ready-to-wear and menswear. As the world’s most influential, and most watched, fashion capital, dealing with coronavirus and the lockdown – which went into effect just after the February/March runway season ended –  was a huge task, given that Paris stages over 400 live runway shows annually.After delaying both the Haute Couture and menswear seasons, the Fédération took the brave step of staging two fully digital seasons this month. The three-day couture season ended Wednesday night, and the five-day menswear season kicks off Thursday morning. The move to digital involved a major acceleration by the Fédération and the creation – with Launchmetrics – of two new state-of-the-art platforms to host the two fashion weeks. They both bring Paris up to speed digitally after lagging behind their rivals online in London, Milan and New York; even if, when it comes to catwalk clout, the City of Light will always be primus inter pares – first among equals. Testifying to the magnetic pull of Paris, a total of 67 brands will participate in this menswear season.
 
Which is why we caught up with Pascal Morand, the executive president of the Fédération, and Séverine Merle, the CEO of Celine who is also the President of the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine, the Fédération’s menswear division, to hear their vision of diversity on the new menswear platform; the Fédération’s notoriously demanding process for selecting new members; hosting digital creativity and teaming up with Launchmetrics. They also discuss linking up with key cultural institutions and connecting with China via Hylink; even as they both caution that the digital universe will never be a substitute for the physical universe.FashionNetwork.com: Why was it so important to create a new platform for the menswear season?
 
Pascal Morand: Just as with Haute Couture, it seemed very important to us to create a platform for menswear. The health crisis has created difficulties and upheaval that brands have had to overcome and continue to struggle with. We had to get involved and we all rallied together to do so. Menswear fashion week is an indispensable event. It has taken a new form with creative videos broadcast as part of the official calendar, as well as other content provided by brands and cultural institutions, or resulting from our collaboration with the media, etc. It includes a section dedicated to SPHERE, the Fédération’s showroom for emerging brands, which has also taken on a virtual format. The platform is full of films, photos, interviews, round tables and concerts. It has a cultural and creative vocation, just like Parisian fashion.
 
Séverine Merle: When we met with the members of the Chambre Syndicale via Zoom, in the middle of quarantine, there was great enthusiasm for participating in the project for this platform and a lot of members went on to contribute to its enrichment. Such a significant innovation implies a lot of exchange and collective thinking. And we did that by interacting with the participating brands. Their diversity enriched all of our considerations. The mission that we embarked upon was also a way of bearing witness to the vitality of Paris despite the crisis that we’re going through.  
 
FNW: What is it about Paris that attracts so many great foreign designers to the menswear season?
 
PM: You’d have to ask them! In any case, it’s clear that menswear is becoming increasingly important. Paris Fashion Week Men’s has contributed to that trend and will continue to do so. Just as with womenswear, for menswear designers and their brands, Paris is where you come to be recognized and consecrated. It’s also because in Paris there is a real coming together of the arts, both performative and visual. This peculiarity is also present in PFW Online, whose list of participants includes the Louvre and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, the Théâtre du Châtelet and the Palais Galliera, as well as artists from the contemporary music scene, who are taking part with concerts via Radio Nova.  
 
SM: The strength of Paris Fashion Week Men’s is that, following a very rigorous selection process, it brings together both members and invited brands, including established and emerging labels, from across the world and from all kinds of different origins. The selection committee is as demanding as it is open to everyone. The houses and designers that apply understand this because they know it’s a stamp of quality.
Indeed, we opened applications this time round as well, despite the unusual circumstances, and we heard from some excellent candidates. We accepted six for our official calendar, having also paid close attention to their potential for digital creativity.FNW: What are you most excited about seeing in the current season?
 
SM: This season is completely different to anything that we’ve experienced up until now. The transition to digital obviously demands an approach driven by renewed creative efforts. This season will be full of originality and surprises, in the positive sense of term. We’re going to show and broadcast new content of different kinds which has been created in a short time and in a very unusual context. This cocktail of energy, diversity and creativity is very exciting.
 
PM: The digital universe does not replace the physical universe. It’s another world, which seeks sensations and emotions that are often very different. In a way, that gives rise to a kind of augmented creativity, in the same way we talk about augmented reality. We’re expecting even more from the digital productions that have been put together.
 
FNW: Why have so many new houses come on to the schedule this season?
 
SM: There are two factors at play here. The first has to do with the fact that we’ve brought together runway shows and presentations: the two ways for a brand to be included on the official calendar. We had no reason to make this differentiation, seeing as we’re dealing with digital creations. The second factor is linked to the fact that the project had a much larger uptake than we could have imagined when we started out, bearing in mind all the difficulties related to the preparation of collections in the middle of quarantine. Counting runway shows and presentations, there were 82 participating brands at menswear fashion week in January. There are 67 at this online fashion week.
 
PM: Objectively, this figure is already a success in itself. What is more, most of the brands which could not be included in the official calendar feature, in one way or another, in the platform’s magazine, in a section dedicated to the houses. So the international community of menswear brands is very well represented, and brought together virtually, in Paris.
 
FNW: How do you hope to maintain Paris’ position as the leading fashion capital?
 
PM: We’re living through a very turbulent time. We’re going through a severe health crisis at the very moment that the digital revolution is moving into top gear and the necessity of sustainable development has become more evident than ever. And the same thing is happening in terms of respect for diversity. All of this is happening simultaneously. We’ve stepped into a new world and, in this sense, the Covid-19 crisis has accelerated everything. In this context, the strength and vitality of Paris’ place in fashion remain intact, as well as its draw. The important thing is to always be looking to the future and cultivating innovation, as well as design, in collaboration with PFW’s partners and especially with those who have joined us for online projects.
 
SM: Our position as leader shouldn’t encourage us to rest on our laurels, quite the opposite. Staying alert and keeping creative and innovative are still the golden rules. Even truer is the fact that we’re a global brand and that’s especially the case for Paris Fashion Week Men’s. This crisis has pushed us to innovate and develop our creativity more than ever before. The increase in our digital audience will benefit the members and houses on the official calendar, as well as the emerging French and international brands supported by the Fédération. We’ve established partnerships with the big social networks, as well as with Groupe Canal and The New York Times, so that the videos can be easily accessed by everyone around the world when they are broadcast at the time specified on the official calendar. This digitalization is completely compatible with Paris’ identity, albeit a virtual version of that identity.FNW: What were the best elements that Launchmetrics was able bring to the project?
 
SM: To be successful, a platform has to be easy to use in order for it to be appropriated by its users, while also living up to the aesthetic codes of the house and being able to include a range of different content. That’s what we wanted to do with our platform and that’s what was done. That’s both an invaluable development for today and promising progress for the future. To this we have to add the platform’s interoperability with the principal industry players, like a hub that, above all, benefits the houses and the visibility of their own platforms.  
 
PM: Rather than diving into the project by ourselves, we called in Launchmetrics as part of a partnership which became more of a collaboration than a subcontracting situation. Launchmetrics’ expertise in data processing and IT in the fashion and luxury industry is well known. Another thing that Launchmetrics brought was an open-mindedness and a proactivity which ensured that the collaboration between the two teams was very smooth. The Launchmetrics team was therefore able to create the two platforms (for Haute Couture and menswear) just as well as we could have hoped."" Nothing can replace physical runway shows, and the traditional Paris Fashion Week Men’s will reclaim its place"" - Séverine MerleFNW: What can we expect from IFM and why did you decide to work with them?
 
PM: The Fédération and the Institut Français de la Mode maintain links that were further strengthened following its fusion with the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. That’s the case for the IFM’s programmes, as well as for its teaching faculty and, of course, its students. We are now working together on a range of essential issues, such as support for emerging brands and sustainable development. When we began working on the project for our platform, we requested a group from Benjamin Simmenauer, a brilliant IFM professor who is very knowledgeable about the synergy between creative industries, and asked him to be the curator of the magazine during the preparation and implementation of the project. The IFM accepted with pleasure, and Benjamin joined the team, which worked with an intense, start-up atmosphere. Different content provided by the IFM’s teaching staff was included as well. Students majoring in image in the Master of Arts in Fashion Design also offered their support by providing projects involving relevant creative content.
 
SM: The Institut Français de la Mode is very well known and renowned as a school that trains students for professions involving technical savoir-faire, management and design, offering programmes that range from professional training for high school students to doctorates. It’s also a place that is rich in exchanges, where economy and design are in constant contact, and where we can follow and understand the changes happening in fashion and different social movements very closely, both through the teaching staff and the students. This shines through in its programmes and in all of its activities. We wanted to insert our project in a very contemporary perspective in terms of its thinking and its actions. The relationship with the IFM was therefore very natural.
 FNW: What innovations from this menswear season do you suspect will be incorporated when Paris can again stage a season of live catwalk shows?
 
SM: Nothing can replace physical runway shows, and the traditional Paris Fashion Week Men’s will reclaim its place. But that’s not to say that the digital fashion week will be completely removed. We’re going to discuss this with the members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine and all of the participants after 13 July. It would be fair to think that the platform and the mechanisms that we have implemented may well have many more days ahead of them, during which they will continue to augment the impact of our physical runway shows when they begin again. The opening up of the menswear fashion week to everyone, as allowed by the digital format, is very likely to remain, and that’s a good thing.
 
PM: Certainly, watching through a screen can’t replace watching in the “real world” and that’s the same for many other sensations. It’s also true that the empathy which characterizes the professional milieu during a physical fashion week cannot be reproduced in the digital world. We’ve noticed that designers and brands are hoping to return to real-world events, where they can be in the same space as each other. The world is moving towards hybrid events and fashion is no exception. When innovation teams up with design, there will always be a step forward. So physical fashion weeks will be enriched by its digital aspects, a shift that is already tangible. Design is at the centre of it all. On the one hand, it has no boundaries, just like the imagination of designers and creative directors. On the other, the heart of fashion design is clothes and collections, which achieve their greatest expressivity in presentations and physical runway shows.
 
FNW: What are you doing for China in particular?
 
PM: When we decided that we wanted a worldwide broadcast, we established partnerships with YouTube and Instagram. It was necessary to do the same with the most important networks in China. The Fédération was not very active in the country, at least in terms of social networks. That’s why we approached Hylink, the largest independent marketing and digital communication agency in China. Once we’d established the foundations of our cooperation, it was Hylink who tasked us with linking up with Tencent/Wechat and the other big social networks. The principle is the same as the one we adopted for our main platform: with Hylink’s support, we conceived a Chinese sister platform, hosted by Wechat and featuring a partnership with Tencent Video. The content of the platforms is also passed on to the other social networks. Two renowned industry commentators commentate the videos, as was the case during Haute Couture week.
 
SM: The visibility of the content created as part of Paris Fashion Week Men’s on all social networks was a key element in our considerations from the beginning. In this sense, we obviously wanted to establish the most relevant partnerships possible in China. It was important, not only for the big-name houses, who have their own media firepower, but also for emerging brands, as we are aware of the difficulties that they have to face. Millions of people will therefore be able to see and discover these menswear designers. That’s how we’re hoping to make sure that Paris, and the menswear linked to Paris, continue to shine.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 7, 2020","Designer Gabriela Hearst has announced plans to move her next runway show to Paris during the French ready-to-wear season this fall, in a major win for the City of Light.“We have become an international brand with most of our clients living outside of the US. That’s why in February 2018 we opened our showroom and home in Paris. When we started to asses with the team what the best course of action was to navigate the ever changing landscape as a result of the pandemic, we realized that for many reasons it became increasingly clear that we will have to present in Paris from an environmental perspective and from a logistics and transportation perspective. But above all, it is always a dream for any designer to show in Paris. This is the time for us to manifest this dream,” said the designer in a release.

Of Uruguayan origin, Hearst has become one of the most happening brands – and shows – in the New York season. Her ability to blend the earthy aesthetic of the gauchos and rural imagery of her native land, with a chic patrician take on sustainable fashion, have made her an important contemporary voice in fashion.The decision to move her next presentation to Paris underlines the continuing attraction of the city as the world’s leading fashion capital, which has lured such influential designer labels as Paul Smith, Proenza Schouler and Rodarte to show here in the past few seasons.

“I moved to New York 20 years ago, this is the city where I grew from a young adult to womanhood. In New York, is where I have manifested so many of my dreams including being the mother of three New Yorkers. We did our first show in New York in February 2017 without any plastic and using repurposed materials and dead stock fabrics,” noted Hearst, both founder and creative director of her eponymous label.

Hearst’s most recent show was held in February, in Chelsea, staged amid a small maze of walls of upcycled paper bales that a recycling facility in Brooklyn had transformed from her own company’s waste. Practically, every look had a recycled component – like recycled cashmere yarns used in superlative, loosely woven columns. Hearst even revamped Turkish carpets to become very cool, gothic, paisley dusters.

Since launching her label in 2015, Hearst has gone on to retail in major international stockists, and open two key flagships on Madison Avenue in New York and Brook Street in London last year. Her debut in Paris for the next season – to be held in late September and early October – will be a must-see event.

"Jul 7, 2020","Talk about a concise couture concept. Chanel unveiled its latest haute couture collection at noon on Tuesday, in an online format. It took the shape of a snappy and stylish video that referenced the legendary Paris nightclub Le Palace, in a clip that lasted a mere one minute and 22 seconds.Shot with considerable panache by noted Swedish photographer Mikael Jansson, the film was the shortest by far for the Paris season, which this July is an entirely digital fashion week with 33 couture houses listed on the official calendar.

“The collection… is distinguished by a desire for opulence, brilliance and sophistication. I had in mind the heads of eccentric princesses, the type of women that Karl Lagerfeld like to accompany to soirées in the Palace,” said Chanel couturier Virginie Viard in a cover note.Jansson’s video smartly captured the mood of those halcyon nights at the famed club; with its wild-themed, fancy dress parties which attracted a crazy blend of jet setters, whether gay, straight, rich and poor – and scores of designers, most notably Chanel’s late designer Lagerfeld.

The video featured essentially a mere five looks – albeit with tiny glimpses of other passages – all shot on just two models – opening with Dutch model Rianne van Rompaey in a dazzling, embroidered, tweed, bouclé, off-the-shoulder dress that managed to be both risqué and rock n roll. Followed by black beauty Adut Akech, who wore a bougainvillea-hued, tweed pantsuit. Van Rompaey also looked pretty astounding in an A-line dance party frock, massively embroidered in glistening beads, pearls and metallic thread carnations – all anchored by a pair of laced-up widow’s booties. Akech also made an appearance in a pearl gray taffeta frock, gathered and rouched and accompanied by a Byzantine brooch – exactly the sort favored by Mademoiselle Coco.“I was thinking about a punk princess coming out of ‘Le Palace’ at dawn. With a taffeta dress, big hair, feathers and lots of jewelry. This collection is more inspired by Karl Lagerfeld than Gabrielle Chanel. Karl would go to Le Palace, he would accompany these very sophisticated and very dressed up women, who were very eccentric too,” added Karl’s successor Viard.

Rianne rounds off the clip with a décolleté black dress with an enormous bow, worn with a fab, high jewelry silver pendant, her hair gathered up in spiky posh punk style – in synch with the wild mood of Le Palace. All told, the clip captures the after-hours fetes at Le Palace, where Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol, Roland Barthes and Jean-Paul Goude all rubbed shoulders and Grace Jones sang La Vie en Rose in dry ice perched on a Harley Davidson.

The theme also marked a major change in direction from Viard’s last couture show in January, which referenced Coco’s early education in an austere convent in remote Aubazine.

“I like working like this, going in the opposite direction of what I did last time. I wanted complexity, sophistication,” stressed Viard, who termed this season’s overall mood as “ultra-rock romanticism”.

However, precisely because it was a video, it was hard to appreciate the sheer skill of the house’s embroidery partners, such as Lesage and Montex, or the contributions of Lemarié and Goossens, who embellished the tweeds in sequins, strass and stones. That sort of craftsmanship demands a live catwalk show, which Chanel plans to return to during the next Paris ready-to-wear season this autumn.

All told, the collection is made up of 30 looks – relatively small for a Chanel couture show, but still impressive given the three-month lockdown. According to the release, it apparently includes short dresses with cinched waists and corolla skirts rustling alongside long dresses with a very Grand Siècle allure “and the noble authority of heroines escaping from 19th-century tableaux.” While painted laces enriched bolero jackets and tweeds made of silver-streaked ribbon. Though none of these appeared in the mega-short video.Two days before, Chanel had teased the theme in a 29-second spot by French documentarian Loïc Prigent, which captured the house’s atelier in the final moment of preparation of this Fall-Winter 2020/21 collection. Attached to a door handle is a gilt Chanel bag whose tag line reads: Please Dare to Disturb. It opens to reveal the atelier staff at 31 rue Cambon putting the final touches to the silhouettes created by Viard. Noticeably, Viard wears a white mask throughout – the first designer to be seen in one online this season in Paris. In fact, all the staff wear masks, as they finish a fitting on moody Brazilian model Cristina Herrmann, one of a cast of four to have appeared in Chanel’s latest cruise collection video, Balade en Méditerranée.

“For me, Haute Couture is romantic by its very essence. There is so much love in each one of these silhouettes,” concluded Viard.

"Jul 6, 2020","Schiaparelli kicked off first the ever fully digital Paris haute couture season on Monday with a touching film which concentrated on its couturier Daniel Roseberry’s imagination, since he was marooned in New York throughout the lockdown.Normally, couture week in Paris sees some of the wealthiest women in the world descend on the French capital to see shows and place orders with the great luxury fashion houses or happening independent couturiers. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, French organizers exceptionally initiated a season which takes place online; devoid of any live runway shows.

Today it fell to Schiaparelli to inaugurate the 33-event, three-day season, which includes major league players like Christian Dior, Chanel and Valentino. The whole season is available on a state-of-the-art, new platform – courtesy of the Fédération de la Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body, whose home page features a video statement by Naomi Campbell.“The time has come to collectively call the fashion industry to task regarding inequality in our workspaces and in our industry... Paris is fashion’s central stage and it’s leader. This is a call for action that we are making,” said Campbell, who wore a T-shirt that read: Phenomenally Black.Schiaparelli’s 3.30 minute video, entitled Collection Imaginaire, began with Roseberry packing his sketch book to walk through downtown Manhattan, and into Washington Square, dressed in a baseball cap, white T-shirt and chinos. After finding a park bench, he begins to sketch the collection, the camera capturing statues of Washington painted red by the Black Lives Matter movement.

“I have been living in isolation while Maison Schiaparelli took a hiatus. Everyone has their own lockdown story, some harrowing, some tragic, some utterly lonely.  The luckiest of us have been able to spend this time in nature, far removed from city life. My own experience was shared with millions of other Manhattanites: It was privileged, but nothing extraordinary. What was extraordinary, however, was the ability to walk into Washington Square Park on a Monday morning and sketch out an Haute Couture collection,” explained Roseberry.

Elements of Elsa Schiaparelli's vast output waft in and out of the video – butterflies, surreal eyes and masked balls – as squirrels run in the New York park. Then, Daniel’s
pen leads him to Paris, where he sketches at Schiaparelli’s headquarters on Place Vendôme. Marking in exact instructions on each sketch – huge volume sleeves; S-shaped metal heel caps or measuring tape beading.

It helps that Roseberry is an excellent illustrator, who enthusiastically uses a felt tip pen to color the signature shocking pink of the house into one evening gown.

The morning continued with Ulyana Sergenko, whose video was a homage to the ancient skills of her homeland, the DNA of Russian fashion, with its delicate lace and rich embroideries. Section II featured illustrators preparing fine sketches of each design, before the couturier participates in an actual fitting. All backed up by an intense jazz drum solo.

Section III had Ulyana marching out her cast in phalanxes to a military tattoo of drums, before a long pull-away shot of the designer standing in Russian steppes at a somber sunset. All featuring Sergenko’s ""grand soirée"" couture to considerable effect.

The morning ended with Iris van Herpen, who showcased a three-minute film entitled Transmotion. With just one of the Dutch couturier’s remarkable high-tech, tulle, shell-shaped dresses embroidered in jet bugle beads worn by ethereal model Carice van Houten. Directed by Ryan McDaniels and all backed up by a spacy soundtrack, Hania Rani – F Major. By van Herpen’s path-breaking standards, this felt like a faint echo.In an opening day, with 12 houses listed on the calendar, London’s Ralph & Russo also presented a six-minute video, where Tamara Ralph explained that she had referenced the Seven Wonders of the World. She even superimposed many outfits on locations like the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal.

The Australian-born but London-based Ralph spent lockdown in her villa in Cannes, but stressed: “All of the creatives have been working remotely, but talking every day.”

Ralph also digitized florals and fauna with blurred technical finishes for some bravura prints. Plus, she actually showed real models dancing in pastel, froufrou, tulle ball gowns, finished with platinum-hued eyeliner.

The house introduced a new avatar called Hauli, the neatest techie innovation so far in the world’s first digital couture season.

"Jul 6, 2020","Maria Grazia Chiuri unveiled her latest haute couture collection for Christian Dior on Monday afternoon in a remarkably beautiful film that seems destined to become an instant classic work of surrealist cinema. 
Shot amid ancient ruins around Rome, and directed by Matteo Garrone, the film starred a series of nymphs, mermaids, fauns and mythological creatures in an elegiac garden, and referenced the ""Théâtre de la Mode"", when French designers developed miniature mannequins at the end of WW2 and sent them on a tour of Europe and the USA to revive the counrty's fashion industry.
 
In Garrone’s film, the reverie of the beautiful sylvan creatures is quietly interrupted by two hotel porters carrying a huge trunk done in the design of Dior’s Paris flagship on avenue Montaigne. Immediately intrigued, a half-dozen beauties swimming semi-clad underneath an ancient Roman bridge  quit their play to discover within the trunk a series of miniature couture creations.
 
The collection is one of 33 on the official schedule of this July’s Haute Couture week in Paris. However, even just a half-day into this unique couture season – an entirely digital Fashion Week of three days – this Dior oeuvre looks like it is the highlight.
 
The actual opening image was of the seamstresses – or petit mains – in Dior’s famed atelier back in Paris working on the collection; teasing out the hem of a satin dress with a tiny needle, or gently posing a plissé column over an 18-inch high doll. 
Entitled Le Mythe Dior, the 10-minute film recounts how these magical beauties all fall in love with the clothes. Such as when one porter tempts a chiselled jawed beauty out of a giant shell to come and order a ribbed Grecian column dress. The bell hops carefully taking her measurements with a tape, to a moody soundtrack by Paolo Buonvino.
 
“During World War Two artists and couturiers combined to create this theatre of fashion – mini dolls and costumes built to be sent on a world tour. So, I wanted to transform this concept, this conceit, and express it for today,” explained Chiuri.The designer was also influenced by the “magnificently inspiring figures” of the Surrealist movement: women like Lee Miller, Dora Maar, Dorothea Tanning, Leonora Carrington and Jacqueline Lamba. Muses in each of their chosen fields.

“We were not trying to resemble a show, more tell a story. To me it’s Roma at kilometer zero. Plus, I like the fact that Matteo Garrone makes film like an artisan – which is my way of making fashion,” she added.

The collection is so alluring even a couple of forest spirits kissing passionately inside a tree give up their embrace for the lady to pick up a black dress in lace lattice and camouflage plissé. The clothes so chic they awake an ancient stone stature of a goddess, who fingers a sheath dress longingly. Both the shell woman and the ancient deity both recalling Maria Grazia with her current white mane.

Even someone who couldn’t care a hoot about fashion could only admire this beautiful film. After the dark days of the lock-down it felt like a generous gift by Dior to the world. A timely reminder of the importance of fantasy in all our lives.

Roman-born Chiuri spent the lockdown in her native city, which is where she designed this collection and where she shot the film with Garrone. He is best known for his brilliant Dogman, a dark gritty tale of a seedy drug dealing underworld which won the Palm d’Or in Cannes in 2018, light years away from Le Mythe Dior.
 
Where Dogman portrayed the lower depths of post-industrial Italy, Garrone’s work for Dior captures that unique quality of Italian filmmakers to evoke hallucinatory fantasies – A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the Alban Hills. Yet, it all also seemed fitting on a day when Italy lost another great Roman, Ennio Morricone, the single most important composer in Italian cinema, that Dior should unveil this extraordinary film.

Only Narcissus, incapable of stopping admiring his own reflection in a stream fails to notice the clothes, in a neat feminist commentary on male vanity.

Marching through a bamboo forest a red-head muse fingers a diaphanous black pagoda shaped plissé gown, and turns to request her horny-headed Pan, who grants her permission to order the look. A purchase which she then celebrates by dancing in a stream, dappled light through the tress creating an image of rare finesse, thanks to brilliant cinematography by Nicolaj Bruel.

“The clothes are a collection that respects the craftsmanship of couture. And of the Dior heritage; from noble lines and special silk plisse that maintain volumes. Plus, the miniatures are all fully composed outfits,” noted Chiuri.

By the film’s end, even the mermaid had picked up a stone-colored gown in which she swims across a mossy bottom river in the Alban Hills; while nymphs weave the giant tresses of their Venetian blond leader by now attired in a burnished gold satin robe.

"Jul 5, 2020","The house of Hermès kicked off the Continent’s first purely digital fashion week on Sunday with a low-key performance art video of its spring 2021 menswear collection. 
 
In effect, the film was a pretend photo séance for the look-book of the collection, backed up by soulful piano music. Entitled Hors Champs – or Behind the Scenes in English –  it was a real life backstage preparation moment directed by Cyril Teste, and featured appearances by Hermès long-time men’s designer Veronique Nichanian.
 
“J’aimerais bien faire un travelling autour du miroir,” instructed the video’s director as the cameraman swooped around four models and a large standing mirror.It all captured what Nichanian does best – understated elegance for gents in materials that just waft of class. All made in shades of Mediterranean blue, gravel and almond.
 
Micro-collar, three-button linen sacks suits; charming striped cotton poplin shirts; putty-hued cable knit sweaters all worn by fresh-faced and hirsute models.  All uber effortless, from patch-pocket pants to the zippered blouson shirts. The whole event climaxed with a pair of magnificent abstract print silk shirts.
 
“It’s a reduced collection because we didn’t have access to the means of production,” explained Nichanian in a program note, after showing just 18 looks in eight minutes.
 
The show debuted after almost two weeks of online collections in Paris and Milan, as the pandemic forced the fashion industry to cancel live runway shows and replace them with videos, most of them pre-recorded – such as this one from Hermès. 
 
The French three-day haute couture season begins on Monday, July 6 – 33 online shows and events, starting with Schiaparelli.  Though, curiously, Hermès jumped ahead of the official five-day menswear season in Paris, which does not begin until Thursday, July 9.
 
Chez Hermès, several of the cast descended in a glass elevator into the showroom, located inside the venerable house’s central Paris design studio.
 
“I’d like to see us highlight the details of the pullover,” insisted Nichanian at one point, standing beside a pair of handsome lotharios. The camera also focused on the latest version of the new Slim d’Hermès wristwatch.
 
“This is the fruit of the meeting of two sensibilities. A response to the question: how do you think, react and create in this new context? More that fabricating an event, what we wanted to put together was a meeting, born around work and necessity,” added Teste.

"Jul 2, 2020","The very happening house of JW Anderson unveiled its latest collections online Thursday at 2PM CET online, outside of any official European runway calendar. And without any actual models to be seen.
 Instead, the designer presented his menswear for Spring 2021 and his women’s Resort collection 2021 together on his eponymous website in a 12-minute fashion tutorial entitled A Collection Reveal with Jonathan Anderson.
 
“Hi I’m Jonathan Anderson, I’m here in my office in London and we’re here to talk through the menswear and women’s wear SS collections,” explained Anderson, perched before a large white table.Prior to the presentation, a select band of editors and reviewers had already been mailed a package containing fabric swatches, calligraphy, illustrations, handmade nails, waxed cotton, masks, photos and even a few flowers to their office. Which Anderson termed “mail art,” and an example of the “art of packing.”
 
Developing a collection during the Covid-19 crisis was like “an act of defiance to try to work creatively around solutions,” opined the Ulster-born creator.
 
His big idea in menswear was a whole fisherman theme, and the sense of rather inclement next summer.
 
His opening look was a hybrid composition of cape, hoodie and trench-coat, made of recycled mackintosh materials that looked great.  “Collaged into patchwork utilitarianism… Where it is hard to place the decade,” noted Anderson.
 
Like most of the images, the cape was drawn by Pol Anglada, the Catalan erotica artist, who is an Anderson favorite.
 
Look 25 featured a reference to hand-knit motif of a boat on a lake culled from his grandmother’s needle point, part of what the designer referred to as “reverting back to craft.”
 
Anglada images featured in discharged prints on over-sized knits were also excellent - like hanging tapestries” that had that genderless sensibility that is Anderson’s leitmotif.
 
A series of domestic wallpaper and kicking fabrics made into offbeat frock coats had a cunning jauntiness one could only admire. 

Anderson's women’s Resort ideas all featured masks worn over grand lace jumpsuits and his signature outsized and asymmetrical dresses.  All engineered to look poetic after they had come off the the mannequin.
 
For his night job as creative director of Loewe, Anderson has developed several mega-selling bags, and he came up with some new winners for his own house. To wit: a great new basket-shaped idea based on an early 1920's fisherman’s bag; and for guys: a new backpack made of recycled polyester.
 
“There’s something solitary about fishing,” said the designer, explaining his mood.
 
In summary, Anderson – who never looked directly at the camera in the entire 12 minutes – expounded that the pandemic had allowed him to go “back to making things on your own.” And hence this mail art fashion package, that one can be experience over a cup of coffee in the evening.
 
All told, a stimulating approach to presenting fresh fashion ideas online. Even if it still felt like watching a boxer with one hand tied behind his back, making a brave fist of an unfair situation.

"Jul 2, 2020","The house of Balmain is planning a rockin' party show on a barge along the Seine this Sunday evening to kick off the upcoming extended Paris fashion season. 
The fashionable cruise through Paris is scheduled for the evening on July 5, the night before the official Paris haute couture season begins. With the entire French season online this summer, the boat trip will be one of the few live events on the calendar.
 
 
Entitled Balmain sur Seine, it is being billed as a “celebration of rediscovery, eternal values and better days ahead.”Creative director Olivier Rousteing has invited singer Yseult to perform on the bateau before Paris’s famous skyline, allowing thousands to witness the spectacle from the banks of the Seine, which were closed to the public during the pandemic. The Balmain bateau will also feature a dance troupe choreographed by Jean-Charles Jousni, who also organized a memorable performance for Balmain’s menswear show in January. He also invited director Andrew Makadsi, a key cohort of Beyoncé, to develop the cruise concept along the river, inspired in part by the Black Lives Matter movement.
 
“I hope you will join me in raising a glass to our beloved hometown of Paris, Yseult, Jean-Charles, Andrew, and all the dancers—and, above all, to our optimistic hopes for a better future for all,” said Rousteing, who noted that his boatload of talent will also be seen on TikTok - marking the first time this social media company will livestream a luxury brand event.
 
The designer stressed that both his latest ideas and historic looks from the archives will be featured in this performance.
 
“I love that I work for a house that supports me and has joined with me in pushing for inclusion and changes from the very first day that I began working here. And I’ve always found it interesting that my own optimism in a better future is something that echoes the unusual legacy of Pierre Balmain. It was 75 years ago that our founder decided to take a risk during an uncertain time and open his eponymous couture house. What Monsieur Balmain and succeeding Creative Directors produced, decade after decade, was a key ingredient in the post-war renaissance of Parisian fashion. We are happy to present a few of their incredible, timeless designs to you today,” he enthused.
 
During his 10-year tenure at Balmain, Rousteing has garnered an enviable reputation as one of fashion’s greatest showmen. A year ago, in June 2019, he threw the biggest party of Paris menswear, a magnificent runway show and concert in the Jardin des Plantes with performances by Darren Criss, who played the character Blaine in the hit TV series 'Glee'; and Rag‘n’BoneMan, in a heartfelt set to support Bono’s Red project. 
 
“I think every one of us will forever remember this past spring as being a dark one, marked by strange new fears and mandatory isolation. Even for those lucky enough to only have had to deal with Zoom frustrations and cabin fever, the recent confinement made very clear just how much we had taken for granted until that moment. Forced apart, we suddenly realized that we depended on being together. Locked inside, we longed for the beauty of the outside public spaces of our hometown, Paris. And, faced with the unending reports of unbelievable losses, we came to truly understand the transformative power of solidarity. Today, reunited with friends (while continuing to practice social distancing!), we celebrate our return to Paris, as well as our recent rediscovery of the strengths of those eternal values,” added Rousteing.

“I’ve had the great fortune to be chosen to build upon those foundations. Today, we will also show a bit of the evolution of Balmain over the last decade, concentrating on the tailoring in some of my key dress and jacket designs, with each demonstrating how the 21st-Century Balmain silhouette channels the spirit of past masters,” concluded Rousteing.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jul 1, 2020","It may only be digital but the upcoming debut Paris Fashion Week Online - Menswear looks to be very busy, with 68 events crammed into this month’s five-day season. 
Underlining the vibrancy of the Paris men’s collections, eight new houses have been added to the official calendar released by the Fédération de la Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body. The season, which will feature spring-summer 2021 collections, runs from Thursday, July 9 to Monday, July 13. 
 
Due to the radical overhaul of European fashion weeks caused by the pandemic, this summer Paris menswear is sandwiched between a three-day French couture season that ends July 8, and a four-day Milan menswear season that kicks off on Tuesday, July 14.The menswear newcomers are composed of such notables as Kolor, the acclaimed fashion forward Japanese house making a come-back to the official calendar; Isabel Marant, the star of French rock-n-roll chic; and Ernest W Baker, which despite its names hails from Portugal, and is designed by Reid Baker and partner Ines Amorim. The other five new entrants include three French labels – Alled-Martinez, Cool TM and Egonlab; and two from the opposing coasts of the United States – Brooklyn-based Kidsuper; and Reese Cooper, from Eagle Rock, California.
 
The Paris menswear calendar debuts at 10AM on Thursday, July 9 with Etudes, an experimental French label noted for its unique collaborations – with everyone from Adieu and Porter to Keith Haring and Wikipedia. The season ends with a final display by Lemaire at 7.30PM on Monday evening. 
 
The opening day includes online shows and presentations by such influential players as JW Anderson, Y/Project and Berluti. Also on Thursday, Egonlab, from Paris-based duo Florentin Glémarec and Kévin Nompeix, will be the first debutant this season to unveil its latest collection. 
Friday is a packed day with Louis Vuitton, Yohji Yamamoto, Rick Owens, Dries Van Noten and a debut by Ernest W Baker.
 
Unlike the regular European season, where shows are traditionally staged an hour apart, this July’s Paris menswear sees shows often stacked up every half-hour. Among the the other major league brands presenting this month in Paris menswear are Balmain Homme, Loewe, Hermès, Lanvin, Dior Men and Thom Browne. 
In related news, the Fédération announced: ""The Board of Directors of the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine has the pleasure to announce the nomination of the House Dunhill as a member. It is as such that the house will henceforth participate in our calendars.”

"Jul 1, 2020","The three stripes brand and the NGO Parley for the Oceans are celebrating the fifth anniversary of their partnership with several initiatives to limit marine pollution and put an end to the global plastic crisis. A reinforced collaboration which has notably resulted in the presentation of a new pair of sneakers made from recovered and recycled materials.Launched at the United Nations in 2015, the Adidas and Parley for the Oceans partnership aims to eliminate plastic marine pollution with a three-fold strategy: a maximum effort to avoid the use of plastic, interception of plastic waste in the environment which can then be recycled to make Ocean Plastic, and innovation with the introduction of new materials. When it was initially announced, the partnership presented a prototype pair of sneakers with uppers made from recovered and recycled materials. 

Five years later, Adidas and Parley are still working hand in hand to end plastic marine pollution. The three-stripes brand has recently announced a commitment to phase out virgin polyester from its collections. By the end of 2020, the brand will ensure that more than 50% of polyester used in its products is sourced from recycling, and by 2024, it aims to exclude virgin polyester completely.New materials to eradicate marine pollutionOn the occasion of the fifth anniversary of their collaboration, Adidas announced that it would be a founding partner in the Parley Institute for Material Science, which aims to develop new materials to replace plastic in the long term.

""... The next step for us, in partnership with Adidas, is to develop a completely new generation of materials to see all these harmful substances -- that are destroying our planet, that are destroying our future -- go. You can expect from us to come up with new fabrics and technologies that build on what we see in nature,"" pointed out Cyrill Gutsch, the founder and CEO of Parley for the Oceans.

The two partners also unveiled ""Adidas Parley UltraBOOST DNA"" sneakers, which are made from recovered and recycled materials and directly inspired by the prototype pair presented five years earlier. The limited edition shoes will enable the sportswear brand to donate 30 euros to Parley for each pair purchased over a three-day period.

Adidas also pointed out that since the launch of its partnership in 2015, it has produced some 30 million pairs of shoes using Parley Ocean Plastic.

"Jun 30, 2020","The Fédération de la Couture et de la Mode, the governing body of French fashion, has created two dedicated new platforms to present this July’s haute couture and menswear seasons in Paris. And, in an unprecedented step, the Fédération also announced on Monday that it had inked a series of deals with YouTube, Google, Instagram and Facebook for the upcoming digital seasons.An association of several score of major league fashion houses – including the likes of Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Yves Saint Laurent – the Fédération also revealed that it had signed a partnership with Launchmetrics to develop the new digital hub, to feature the upcoming seasons. As noted, the haute couture season will be held from July 6 to 8, while the menswear season will run from July 9 to 13.
 
The three-day couture season opens with Schiaparelli at 10am on Monday morning and ends with Valentino at 6pm on Wednesday. Encompassing 33 houses, the season will feature slots with practically all the major Paris-based couture houses – Chanel, Dior, Giambattista Valli. On top of that, key non-French couturiers are all planning displays – Elie Saab, Viktor&Rolf, Ralph&Russo and Iris van Herpen, among others.However, Givenchy, which recently named a new creative director, Matthew Williams, will be absent, while the debut of a guest designer at Jean Paul Gaultier, Sacai’s Chitose Abe, has been delayed until next January. 
 
Given the added and novel complications of staging the first French digital seasons, many people are expecting a somewhat byzantine process - with open-access to many events, and gated resources for others. Editors have already begun receiving emails from major global brands notifying them of needed passwords to the unveiling of various online events.
 
The end-goal of the new platforms is to open the doors to a far larger global audience, while also restricting access to key industry events to acknowledged professionals. The Fédération has set up a partnership with Hylink, the largest independent digital communication agency from China, to cooperate with the most important Chinese social networks. The two seasons are widely expected to be highly experimental – and will include viral videos; “backstage” interviews; behind-the-scenes footage; commentary and debates.
 
An online magazine, created in cooperation with a fashion school primarily targeted at management, the Institut Français de la Mode, will “bring together additional content (interviews, making of, ideas, zooms) supplied by houses, stakeholder cultural institutions, media and other contributors,” according to a release from the Fédération. 
 
Moreover, the organization promised a series of events (conferences, conversations, concerts, cultural visits...), which will be organized by different houses and partners. Once again, some of these events will be reserved for professionals.
 
In a related move, Sphère, the Federation's professional showroom dedicated to young brands, will also be held online and will be specifically hosted on the Paris Fashion Week Menswear online platform. Sphère has developed partnerships with the B2B sales platform Le New Black and with Grand Shooting, processing images and ensuring quality for each participating house. 
 
“We’re now at the height of the digital revolution, which has only been accelerated by the Covid-19 crisis. The digitization of Fashion Week will never replace in-person events but it will largely enrich and amplify creative expression and communication,” said Pascal Morand, Executive President of the Fédération, in a release from Launchmetrics.
 
Besides social networks, the Fédération has established a partnership with Canal +, which will create an events channel for Paris fashion with a subscription-free digital corner. It has also partnered with The New York Times to broadcast the videos from the two events' official calendar in a dedicated space on the daily’s website. 
 
Finally, the Fédération said it expects contributions from a whole slew of media and cultural organizations, including Paris’ Radio Nova, one of the Federation's partners; the Musée du Louvre; Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Musée de la Mode de la Ville de Paris, and Théâtre du Châtelet.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 29, 2020","In what looks to be a return to business as usual, the family-run fashion label Etro has opted to present its latest men's and women's collections with a physical show at the next Milan Fashion Week (July 14-17), which was supposed to be all online.The next Milan Fashion Week, which is set to go ahead in the third week of July, is shaping up to be a physical-virtual hybrid rather than an all-online affair. Hot on the heels of Dolce & Gabbana, another Italian fashion house Etro has announced it will be holding a physical show. The event will showcase its menswear 2021 spring-summer collection and its 2021 women's Resort collection. 

The brand has explained to WWD that its decision will send a positive message to the fashion industry, which is struggling to get back to normal in the wake of an unprecedented period of crisis.However, the planned show will nonetheless be marked by the pandemic in the manner in which it is organized. The public will be present, but will not be as numerous as it has been in previous years. At the same time, those who are not fortunate enough to see the new collections at the physical event will be able to watch live streams of the show on the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana and the Etro brand websites.

Milan Digital Fashion Week is set to run from July 14 to 17, shortly after the Paris Haute Couture shows (from July 6-8) and the Paris Men's Fashion Week (from July 9-13), both of which will also be online affairs.

"Jun 29, 2020","The Camera della Moda, Italian fashion’s governing body, has unveiled the schedule for the debut of Milan Digital Fashion Week this July, a powerful listing including 39 video displays, presentations and even live events by brands – a calendar that includes mega labels like Prada, Gucci, Zegna and Dolce & Gabbana. 
The four-day season kicks off on Tuesday, July 14 – opening at 12PM with MSGM, the tailored street-wear label of DJ Massimo Giorgetti. That opening day will also include collections from Prada, Alberta Ferretti and Philipp Plein.
 
This is a hybrid season, with both men’s collections and women’s pre-collections for Spring/Summer 2021. As noted, due to the global pandemic, the Camera and Europe’s other major fashion federations in Paris and London converted their summer weeks into fully digital seasons this year.Because of the necessity of social distancing, and radically reduced travel, Italian fashion houses have all been busy inventing new formats to present their collections. The result is that this Milan season is expected to be a pot-pourri of pre-recorded videos; live presentations; private Zoom tutorials and even some live shows before selected real audiences.
 
For instance, Wednesday opens with a 10AM show from Etro, which is planning an actual live show before a limited number of guests inside Milan’s chic Four Seasons Hotel, that will then be live-streamed on Etro and the Camera's dedicated digital platforms. 
 
“We value the importance of digital but also believe in the vital energy of live interactions,” said Kean and Veronica Etro.
 Wednesday climaxes with a 5.30PM show by Dolce & Gabbana – a major achievement – as it marks the first time the duo have been listed on the Camera’s official schedule in over two decades. Dolce & Gabbana is also planning a live event, showing its men’s ready-to-wear collection before a small audience inside Humanitas University.
 
Thursday will feature global brands like Salvatore Ferragamo, Tod’s and DSquared2, as well as emerging labels like Simona Marziali – MRZ, Han Kjobenhavn and David Catalan.
 
The Italian season finishes on Friday afternoon, July 17, anchored by three heavy hitter labels – Gucci, Italian’s largest fashion label in terms of revenue; powerhouse menswear brand Ermenegildo Zegna and the country’s most famous knitwear marque: Missoni.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 26, 2020","As protests for racial justice continue across the U.S., industries are being pushed to confront systemic racism. Leading a new effort within the fashion and beauty industries, Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner and Sandrine Charles, fashion publicist and owner of Sandrine Charles Consulting, have co-founded the Black in Fashion Council “to represent and secure the advancement of Black individuals in the fashion and beauty industry,” the two said. 

The council will officially launch next month, in partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. With additional support from the Human Rights Campaign, the council will work to support Black people in the industry by establishing an equality index score that will provide benchmarking around corporate policies and practices pertinent to the inclusivity of Black employees, the CFDA said. This will include a yearly public report to track the work of companies that have made a three-year commitment to foster representation of Black employees at all levels, the report said.

Members of the council's executive board will include costume designer Shiona Turini, Harlem's Fashion Row founder Brandice Daniel, and GQ deputy fashion director Nikki Ogunnaike, among others. 

“The Human Rights Campaign already has a Corporate Equality Index for people with disabilities and the LGBTQ community that companies like Kering are already a part of,” Peoples Wagner told Vogue.com.

“This would be a way to continue to give companies a report card of accountability without them feeling like they’re being shamed into it, and giving them the actual resources of what people are saying they want to see changed.”

“We’d like everybody to participate; we don’t want to segment based on larger brands or smaller brands. We really want this to be a collective of everyone, so we built out an industry standard of what we want diversity and inclusion to look like moving forward."" 

The announcement of the Black in Fashion Council's upcoming launch comes after the CFDA revealed a series of new initiatives to combat systemic racism within the fashion industry earlier this month. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 25, 2020","The organiser of Copenhagen Fashion Week has released the complete line-up of brands for the upcoming edition to be held from August 9-12.The list of 34 brands from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, and the UK is the same size as for the last event, indicating “that the industry continues to support the fashion week and believes in the value of standing together”, the organiser said.

The event will see Rabens Saloner making its catwalk debut at CFW after having previously been a long-term partner at the fashion week’s linked tradeshows.Founder and Creative Director, Birgitte Raben said joining the official show schedule “is an important step forward for the brand. Copenhagen Fashion Week is a central international partner, which provides us with a strong platform to reach key international buyers and press”.

But given the unusual circumstances this season, the brand will be embracing the new format of Copenhagen Fashion Week by showing an exclusive online pre-recorded presentation.

Other Danish brands taking part will include Ganni, Stine Goya and Henrik Vibskov. Meanwhile Sweden will participate with Rodebjer, Hope and Whyred; Norway with Holzweiler; Finland with Marimekko; Germany with Lala Berlin and Malaikaraiss; and the UK with Rixo. 

This year’s CFW will feature a mix of both physical and digital shows. Denmark is recovering quickly from the pandemic, which is the main reason that the hybrid mix is possible rather than just a digital happening.

Physical shows this time will include brands like Soulland and Mark Kenly Domino Tan. Their physical events will also be streamed digitally “to secure exposure and reach”.

Other brands will be opting for digital-only, including Baum und Pferdgarten and By Malene Birger, while Ganni has chosen both physical and digital.

But even with the heavy digital focus, in order to boost the event as a physical happening, Copenhagen Fashion Week will present a physical hub in downtown Copenhagen that will serve as a gathering place and networking centre for the industry. It will host an extensive talk programme and industry/consumer events.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 23, 2020","The Italian fashion house, which caused a stir on June 20 with a spectacular concert at the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, will open Milan Fashion Week on September 22.The label will be hosting a catwalk show at its headquarters in Rome, reports WWD. The location is nearly 600 km from the Lombard capital.

What do the September Fashion Weeks for the 2021 spring-summer season have in store? The question is an ongoing preoccupation in the fashion sphere in the wake of individual announcements by major labels. Hot on the heels of Burberry, which has planned an outdoor runway show with an exclusively digital experience for the public and the brand's usual guests, Fendi has lifted the veil on plans for its next show.On September 22, the Italian house will open Milan Fashion Week (September 22 to 28) with a show to present its new collection in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, which also houses the brand's headquarters. According to specialist website WWD, Fendi CEO Serge Brunschwig has said the show will be ""a physical event, with a limited number of guests and a digital component, the format of which is being defined.""

In the meantime, the luxury brand is sending an optimistic message of hope with initiatives in support of artistic expression. This was notably the case on June 20, the day of the summer solstice, in Rome, when Fendi organized a concert entitled ""Fendi Renaissance - Anima Mundi"" at the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The event featured the musicians of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia and violinist Anna Tifu, who performed ""L'Estate"" (""Summer"") from Antonio Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" on the steps, under the arcades and on the roof of the famous monument.

On Wednesday, June 24, the Italian house is also presenting a new capsule ""California Sky"" created in partnership with Los Angeles-based artist Joshua Vides. A teaser unveiled by Fendi offering a glimpse of the new collaboration shows that it will feature ready-to-wear and leather pieces marked by black and white motifs that are typical of the contemporary artist.

The new creations can be found in Fendi's online store at Fendi.com. The brand's website is also offering internet users a chance to watch a full-length video of the ""Fendi Renaissance - Anima Mundi"" concert.

"Jun 22, 2020","Behind a heavy red curtain, Neil Latchman checks the fit of a suit made especially for him by Maurice Sedwell, a tailors which has been making bespoke clothes in London since 1938.Non-essential shops have reopened as Britain’s coronavirus lockdown eases, allowing customers who prefer their outfits made to measure to return to Savile Row, the central London street synonymous with tailor-made clothes.

Standing in front of dozens of suit jackets in old-fashioned glass cabinets, Latchman keeps still while his chest is measured by shop manager Judith Ekblom Jarrold wearing a plastic face visor.“Part of the joy of bespoke is that interaction that we have with customers - getting to know them, having them in the shops so that we are able to make a really personal experience,” she said.

Maurice Sedwell’s tailors cut and sew fabrics like vicuna and cashmere for customers including politicians and business leaders, and despite the safety precautions of visors and gloves, Ekblom Jarrold says it is mostly business as usual.

“There’s not much difference in the way we interact with our customers. One of the key things for us has always been making sure that we’re not invading their personal space,” she said.

Amongst the fabric samples, tailoring scissors and buttons, Latchman said that knowing Maurice Sedwell would not be full of people made him feel more secure and he had decided not to wear a face mask, as he explained why he opted for bespoke suits.

“It gives me the body that I don’t really have,” he said, “so there’s a lot of work, a lot of craftsmanship, a lot of art that goes into it.”© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Jun 16, 2020","Michael Kors has reignited the debate about the fashion calendar. The New York-based designer will not host a runway show in September, preferring to reveal his collection to the world sometime between mid-October and mid-November via a presentation, the details of which have yet to be defined. According to the brand, this move away from the catwalk could last until February 2021. 
 The brand's plan is to return its Michael Kors Collection to the production and presentation of two collections per year, one for Spring/Summer, the other for Fall/Winter, in order to allow for ""a more streamlined approach on the sales floor."" The decision comes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has resulted in disruptions in the current fashion system, with its frantic rhythms of overproduction, and has served as something of a wake-up call for designers. 

""I have for a long time thought that the fashion calendar needs to change. It’s exciting for me to see the open dialogue within the fashion community about the calendar—from Giorgio Armani to Dries Van Noten to Gucci to YSL to major retailers around the globe—about ways in which we can slow down the process and improve the way we work. We’ve all had time to reflect and analyze things, and I think many agree that it’s time for a new approach for a new era,"" said Kors in a release. Product deliveries will be planned to arrive gradually in stores each season in order to respond more directly to the needs of consumers, announced the label. ""It is imperative that we give the consumer time to absorb the fall deliveries, which will just be arriving in September, and not confuse them with an overabundance of additional ideas, new seasons, products and images,"" explained the designer. 

According to Kors, September and March will still be ""key months in launching the beginning of seasonal selling for the consumer."" ""This is when key editorial and media content hit, when the weather is starting to change, and when people are ready to absorb new collections and product—that they can wear and shop immediately,"" he said.  The designer is still evaluating the best way to present his Fall/Winter collection to the public and the press, but clarified that it will probably be ""sometime between mid-March and mid-April.""

The American house will now organize itself so as to sell its collections to retailers before they are presented to the public and the press, thereby giving the logistics and production chain time to manufacture and distribute products, and creating a healthier rhythm of production. 

Giorgio Armani was one of the first brands to call on the fashion industry to react in order to ""repair what's not working,"" ""cut out superfluous production"" and ""rediscover a more human dimension."" In April, Saint Laurent followed suit and announced that it was pulling out of the Parisian fashion calendar in 2020 ""in order to follow its own agenda."" In May, it was Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele's turn to explain that he was going to adopt his own rhythm, specifying that he will not host a runway show in September but confirming that he will participate in Milan's digital fashion week in July. 

In parallel, Belgium's Dries Van Noten and young French designer Marine Serre released a manifesto signed by a number of small fashion houses and retailers, including Chloé, Thom Browne, Y/Project, Lemaire, Alexandre Mattiussi, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. In the document they called for real change in the fashion industry through a reduction in production, travel and promotions, as well as more eco-friendly runway shows.

"Jun 14, 2020","Few videos better summed up the mood of London Fashion Week’s debut digital online season this weekend than designer Matthew Miller’s contribution's name - Post Apocalyptic Merchandise.Devoid of any actual live runway shows, but crammed full of ideas and attitude, London Fashion Week on Sunday was centered around the themes of sustainability and inclusiveness that defines our current zeitgeist; along with a search for a more elegiac and innocent fashion. And also, the desire for survivability – given how many fledgling fashion houses are under threat.
 
Miller showed a collage of archive footage played over a dark industrial soundtrack to “give a snapshot of where we currently are as a species and reflect the tumultuous, uncertain times of today.” Retro exercise videos; robot factories and speeches by Colonel Gadhafi mashed up with fighter plane test runs, missiles and lots of young models – each of them wearing masks and t-shirts reading ""The New Normal"", ""Armed Self Defense"" and ""New Future Systems"".Innocence was the leitmotif at Preen by Thornton Bregazzi’s, with a short video by Turkina Faso of a fresh-faced blonde dancing and running at sunset in a hilly urban park – attired in bright red, gathered and puckered gowns, holding frilly, sugar pink cocktails. The soundtrack was a mix of Gabriel Prokofiev and a department store elevator voice announcing that doors were opening, closing, going up, or down. Sewing a little confusion – the video was listed as Seasonless 2020. 
Originally planned as a menswear season, as a result of the pandemic, the British Fashion Council changed the weekend to a gender-free moment; a purely online series of events, most of them pre-recorded videos. Though Sunday actually began with an interview with UK fashion’s most famous knight – Sir Paul Smith. 
 
“I’ve actually been working all this period of lockdown. Lonely, but interesting as we have been so creative. When I started in fashion here it was about particular British fabrics – countryside dressing or City dress. Now, I think it has some sense of humor and a more lateral way of thinking about it,” said Smith, speaking in his Covent Garden office, in a conversation with Hu Bing, LFW China Ambassador. 
 
“My first trip to Beijing was in the 1980s and my guide told me there was 12 million bicycles. Now there must be 200 million cars,” recalled Smith, who, when asked if he had a message for a Chinese audience, responded: “Individuality and having your own personality is such a lovely thing in this homogenous world. Like a hidden button or colorful lining in our jackets at Paul Smith.” 
 
“I moved into this room 20 years ago. It was empty then and now is full of books and objects, many sent by fans from all around the world. So fantastic that I can sit at this table with all my assistant designers – and just share ideas immediately, a great color, or an image from an art book. Normally we have 180 people. Now, there is just me. So, starting work on an autumn winter 2020/21 collection is quite hard. I cannot show any of my ideas without scanning and emailing!” he moaned with a loud laugh.
 
“In London, we are blessed to have fantastic art schools and universities, and all this fantastic input from students from all round the world. Maybe the pandemic made us humbler, made for more comradery and keeping our feet on the ground. From a business point of view, it has been a disaster. All my shops are closed but I still have to pay rents and salary,” he concluded. 
The city’s most famous fashion school – Central Saint Martins – showed over a score of MA students developing material at a distance in isolation, with lots of abstract shapes; vibrant sketching and scrapbook images. Not that many real clothes, but an explosive amount of fresh and arresting visions. To cite just three: Ile Guilmard cut out felt fencing jackets and masking tape leggings made in a tiny apartment; Jordan Deeby’s Survivalexert featured superbly gritty sketches and courtier’s jackets and Jacob Pulley riffed on the legendary Klaus Nomi – arguably the first great artist celebrity to be taken by AIDS.
 
America was the subject of one splendid presentation video. Natasha Zinko x DUO Ltd showed the Land of the Free nostalgically, handsome rockers driving across giant poppies fields near oil refineries in a bright red Cadillac convertible. Devoid of any sense of the lockdown, with lots of American flags on backs. Also workerist denim; Fender guitars and some brilliant retro patchwork check rockabilly jackets and micro-pistol print shirts. “The ultimate escape: a trip without a physical journey,” explained the designer. Sounds like the whole season.

A weekend marked by multiple discussions, such as Dylan Jones – GQ editor-in-chief and founder of the independent menswear season in London – talking with designer Christopher Raeburn, whose biggest complaint was about delivering spring collections before Christmas; then putting them on sale or even pulling them out of boutiques before the weather even gets warm.
 
“Fundamentally what we do as an industry doesn’t make sense. It’s obviously flawed,” lamented Raeburn, expressing a common view among designers.
 
An LFW marked by a yearning, one for more innocence, where writer and performance artist Tomfoolery narrated a newly work entitled What Are You Drawing, commissioned by Vogue Italia, whose latest edition is dedicated to children around the world. 
 
Perhaps the most digitally ""true"" moment was hatter Stephen Jones’ mini video, Analogue Fairydust. One where he collaborated with fashion avatar Noonnoouri, who has over 200,000 Instagram followers, and has done ad campaigns previously with Marc Jacobs and Versace. This vegan fashion doll, who shuns fur, appeared in a great series of hats – from swirling spiral fantasies to cut out alpine caps to mini circus master toppers.The previous evening, one of the most thought-provoking pieces was from Osman Yousefzada. It came in the shape of a video he shot in Bangladesh of garment worker women discussing their reactions to fast fashion items found in UK charity shops. All made in their country, but too expensive for them to ever wear. Taking the clothes “full circle back to where they were made, clothes these women were never allowed to try on… like a Marxist division of labor. So, I asked them to imagine who their customers were?” explained Osman in a video discussion of environmental activist and Green Carpet founder Livia Firth.
 
Charles Jeffrey’s contribution was a fundraiser for UK Black Pride. The designer staged a live party from where his Loverboy concept began. Named Solasta – meaning luminous or shining in Scottish – it was held in a basement in Dalston. A series of life performances and videos, all capturing Jeffrey’s DNA in graffiti neo-romanticism.
 
The prize for Sunday’s best video should go to the ""Sustainable Headdress Collection"" from Crown of Ruins. Shot with sensational, youthful abandon by Jiagi Bi and starring KAK – a swirling series of selfie images of models in nine hand-sewn hats perched outside the sunroof of a 4x4, cruising through an Asian metropolis (probably Shanghai) to the music of Slave to Your Lovingby Barrie Gledden.
 
It was left to Mulberry to finish off the season with a party entitled Mulberry’s My Local, an exclusive recording on IGTV, with the hashtag #TakeRootBranchOut. It turned out to be an exclusive performance featuring Låpsley, as part of their virtual My Local Series.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 13, 2020","Just when one thought that you’d expire from the lack of any actually new fashion in London Fashion Week’s debut digital only season, along came Tiscar Espadas, Xander Zhou and Ka Wa Key on Saturday with some genuinely new clothes and ideas. 
It’s a season devoid of actual live shows in London, where most events on the three-day schedule were pre-recorded videos in what the British Fashion Council has defined as a “gender-neutral platform.” The stand-out video on Saturday was Capitulo II, first act by Tiscar Espadas, whose deconstructed sporty tailoring had oodles of attitude. Marvelously ballooning fatigue pants that nipped at the ankle; fab funnel neck parkas; matador trousers with high waists and side pockets and Velasquez worthy shirts with elongated Jesuit sleeves – all presented to the sounds of classical acoustic guitar and flamenco music. A Spanish-born graduate of the Royal College of Art, who was awarded a Burberry Scholarship, Tiscar is definitely a name to watch. This collection, her debut, had tremendous technical flourish and complex construction.
 
London this weekend is the first major season to be held in the pandemic – and its young talent is being closely watched by major fashion houses looking for inventive new ways to showcase their own collections digitally in Milan and Paris in July.
 
One of the cleverest videos by far came from Xander Zhou, who presented a Spring/ Summer 2021 in a spacey video, an almost robotic cast and showroom, with Kraftwerk-style soundtrack. Texts giving fabric blends, colors and construction details; and a commentary from a boffin-like voice, speaking in English and Chinese, added to the deadpan humor. Superhero padded shorts with an ergonomic twist, brilliant color-blocking tops and pixelated print blousons all underlined the powerful futurist vision of Xander Zhou,
 
Xu Zhi, by fonder designer Xuzhi Chen (a previous LVMH Prize finalist) unspooled a great video shot in a decayed underground passage, city street and several elevators that looked very modern and majestic. However, this was not a new collection from the designer.
 
Inspired by the Little Prince, Ka Wa Key mashed up archive pieces and Day-Glo knits into some new party fashion. Using a green screen and obviously limited resources, and working from his home in London during the Covid-19 lockdown, the result was a wacky mix of silent movie lettering; early MTV color and knitted yetis.
 
The evening before Marques'Almeida, Robyn Lynch and Daniel Fletcher also unveiled actual new clothes and ideas. 
Lynch produced a strong, snappy and athletic capsule collection through a heartfelt video. This one-off capsule was supported by Rapha with a homemade film documenting the making of the collection. Lynch also unveiled a video look-book made in collaboration with artist Joe Cruz and styled by Ben Schofield. All told, seven stylish Anglo athleisure looks, with lots of bold cutting; intriguing fabric mixes of Aran sweater cable; hard orange nylon and cable wool, made into natty cycle shorts, racing shirts or dandy tops with heat-seal trims. One of those clever London moments, where energy and imagination more than make up for a lack of financing.   
 
“As the world began to hault (sic) I began to film and document the weeks to come as well as reflect on the past. I wanted to challenge myself to see what I could make from the fabrics that I had to hand, with the accumulation from past seasons, all whilst within the confined space of my home studio,” explained Lynch, whose video showed her team beavering away in cramped workspace amid fabric swatches and sketches; along with clips of old black and white images of the Tour de France and kids cycling in Dublin.
 
One also discovered a whole new line from Marques’Almeida. Named brand ReM'Ade by Marques'Almeida, it emerged when the design duo discovered how much unused stock and fabrics they had in a factory in Portugal. Amalgamating all of it together in London, just before the pandemic hit, they were able to create this novel collection – new and classic M’A designs, made exclusively with deadstock and recycled materials.
 
Shot mainly in Portuguese with subtitles, the actual video begins and ends with images of the designers’ son playing on a rocky beach. The documentary film was created by Agency for the Reality of Things.  The collection captures what makes the duo so unique: bravura cutting, unexpected fabric combinations with denim and an ability to blend street style with historical references. 
The University of Westminster also unveiled their 2020 menswear graduates in an art-rock video, with impressive displays by San Kim, Catherine Hudson, The Rune, Haylee Wong and Halina Edwards.
 
It was also a season of multiple talking heads, like Hussein Chalayan insisting that “I want to do less, but do it more deeply.” And Instagram debates – like Daniel Fletcher in conversation with Miss Vogue editor Naomi Alexandra Pike – a chat that garnered over 16,000 views on Instagram. Fletcher actually unveiled a fall winter 2020 collection, turning classics on their heads – jockey shirts in white with multiple mini metal horse medallions; parkas with toggles and piping; great denim jackets with painted trim. Clever, gender-free clothes that looked fun and very flattering.
 
However, far too many videos referenced past work, albeit with a certain amount of charm. Like the video that opened Saturday morning, where Farfetch China staffers interviewed UK-based talents like Erdem, Charles Jeffry and Roksanda – mainly about collections they showed in February. Except for Jeffrey, who had fresh news on London clubs. For the record, his current favorite is Inferno inside the ICA.

"Jun 12, 2020","London Fashion Week debuted its first ever fully digital season Friday morning, and from the opening moment it began referencing the greater world outside fashion – from the pandemic to the global protests unleashed by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis this month.

With not a single actual live runway show on the three-day schedule, Nicholas Daley kicked off the action for designers with a two-minute video entitled The Abstract Truth. This, however, turned out to be a musical re-edit of the show he already presented in January in London (directed by Amy Douglas-Morris Benavides and Mathias Karl Gontard), which also featured the jangling guitars and intense drumming of a live rock band.As one of this year’s LVMH Prize finalists, Daley often references his parents – a West Indian father and Scottish mother – who first met in a nightclub in Dundee and ended up running a reggae club in Scotland for a half decade. This collection did too, with its blend of Tartan coats; tie-dye ponchos; pearly-men-meet-Rasta-caps and punchy workwear. It actually looked punchy and cool – it's just that the same event already happened five months ago.

The actual opening event was a performance by poet, performer and actor James Massiah. He read his poem Clio Corset, heralded with the phrase: “Let’s throw a party or two, thrown some gladrags on. In your Clio Corset, me in Bianca Saunders, looking anything but shy, in Mowalala and Asai…""After a musical intro, the poet (dressed in a sweatshirt) read his opus, commissioned by the British Fashion Council.

“It’s been long time since I had a summer fling.
And I’m thinking there are a few little things to be flung.
A couple of statues in the sea.
And some of statutes they got wrong.”

Mentioning “police sirens in the distance,” the poem clearly referenced the statue of Edward Colston, an 18th-century slave trader, which was thrown into Bristol Harbor by Black Lives Matter protestors; and a statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouts movement – who is accused of homophobia and supporting Hitler. The statue was removed from the dockside of Poole, Dorsett.Each day in London Fashion Week is divided into three sessions, and the opening morning was completed by videos from Lou Dalton and another LVMH Prize finalist: Priya Ahluwalia of Ahluwalia.

Dalton’s contribution was a discussion with three people with whom she works: stylist Stuart Williamson, creative photographer Mark Neville and her mentor Gordon Richardson, one of the founders of the London menswear season.

“The pandemic gave us all the opportunity to sit back and think, and we all asked, ‘where is my place in all this,’ And, I just want to make clothes that feel relevant, that you want to wear for more than one season,” explained Dalton.

Finishing the opening session, Ahluwalia’s contribution was entitled Jalebi, after her latest book and 3D VR exhibition. Shot by photographer Laurence Ellis as a 360-degree circular camera movement, it featured a virtual art gallery in which was displayed the strands of the designer’s work – images from her folks native Punjabi; Red London buses and a striking image of a Mercedes wrapped in a giant paisley patchwork blanket.

Due to the pandemic, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers (originally scheduled in April) called off this year’s final event, and split its prize money between the eight finalists – meaning that Ahluwalia and Daley will each be awarded 40,000 euros.

The season, which ends Sunday night, includes contributions from such hipster designers as Chalayan, Marques’Almeida, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Matthew Miller, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and Mulberry.

"Jun 11, 2020","Fashion’s biggest collective experiment in many years kicks off Friday morning in the UK with the debut of London Fashion Week Digital, a three-day season which will be a closely watched laboratory for the entire industry. 
By any standards it will be a bizarre season; with not a single live runway show. Yet that has not stopped nearly 35 designers primed to show their wares, albeit all with pre-recorded videos.  
 
Shortly after the pandemic broke out in early March, fashion, like the greater world, went into lockdown. The inevitable result was that all the major fashion seasons in Europe – Florence, London, Milan and Paris – called off any idea of a regular summer runway season.  So, with social distancing rules still clearly necessary, LFW was left with no alternative than to debut its three-day digital season this week. And it turns out to be a pretty darn busy one.
 
“When we decided to properly host a digital season, it was a little like the beginning of London Collection Men (back in 2012). ‘We’re doing it for you. Are you interested?’ And, the uptake has been phenomenal, with lots of engagement.  I think it will be a very successful experiment. More importantly, I think it will also show what will happen going forward,” argues Dylan Jones, the editor-in-chief of GQ UK who was the driving force behind creating a standalone London menswear season.
 
This spring, a series of mega brands – Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada and Max Mara among others – annulled planned cruise shows in exotic locations. So far, of any major house only Chanel has staged any collection online. On Monday, it unveiled a competent but overwhelmingly modest video referencing the inspiration of the collection – Capri. 
However, Jones has already viewed many of the designer videos and was suitably enthusiastic.
 
“They are terrific and very varied. In my view, most people are looking at fashion weeks the wrong way round, being all about designers and brand interact with customers and press, when the real journey is designing a pair of trousers and having someone buy them. People are obsessed with traditional fashion weeks; whereas we are thinking it’s good to have something having completely disruptive right now,” argued Jones, British Fashion Council Menswear Chair.The GQ editor has also been an active participant at the Hay Festival, Britain’s biggest literary fest that takes place annually in Wales, which this year went online too.
 
“At the Hay Festival, for similar reasons, we thought, 'let’s fill the space and put great people together and make it digital' and it's free. And the numbers were extraordinary. The thing is with the digital world you cannot make up any figures. So next year, even if we can do 10 days of talks in the Welsh Valleys, we will still have a digital alternative. There is already an appetite for it,” he concluded.
 
During this three-day London season with over 50 events, Jones will be doing a podcast with Tinie Tempah and interviewing Christopher Raeburn on state of industry. Was he surprised there were not more live events or livestreams?
 
“Not really – when we went into lockdown – we had a completely unrealistic idea of when we were coming out of it. We thought at first end of May and then June and now maybe September. Let’s be honest, a lot of designers don’t have a lot of money right now and the mere the fact that they got bothered to try to create content to attract editors or buyers and develop a point of view is very encouraging,” he insisted. 
Like most people Jones expects to catch the season in  a variety of places – home, local park, even in bed.
 
“That’s how everyone will engage. The downside of everything being completely digital in the world these last months – from all the zoom calls to entertainment - is that 14 hours at a screen is a real challenge,” he notes.
 
LFW has also made a major effort to attract major international retailers, especially those with thriving online businesses. The thinking being that if the traditional retail process is broken, then London has to engage heavily with e-tailers. Hence, significant online names like Farfetch, The Webster and  JD.Com are all presenting films.
 
The actual Friday debut designer film will be by Nicholas Daley, a finalist in this year’s prestigious LVMH Prize, while the weekend will feature such notables as Marques’Almeida, Lou Dalton, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and Matthew Miller. Though the opening event is actually a performance by poet, performer and singer James Massiah. No giant names, perhaps, but plenty of energy.

"Jun 11, 2020","More details are emerging about the events that we will see when the newly digital London Fashion Week starts on Friday morning with luxury shopping area Mount Street offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into the working lives of some of its best known designer names.Roksanda, Erdem and Roland Mouret will be the stars of a video created exclusively for LFW giving viewers a rare look at their working lives and the products they create.

It's all part of a major effort by the industry as a whole to get fashion, one of the most important sectors in the UK economy, working again and back into the global consciousness.The pandemic has understandably seen many consumers feeling that fashion is a frivolous thing that needs to take a back seat when people are dying. But with lockdowns easing as the outbreak subsides, it's important for the industry to help kickstart economic activity again.

As such, Erdem will be sharing an exclusive look at the Pre-Fall 2020 collection. And unlike the runway shows or lookbooks that usually show off individual collections, this time the footage will also show the craftsmanship that goes into those collections, including the finishing touches that bring the clothes to life.

We’ll also see Roland Mouret demonstrating how he manipulates fabric into the designs seen on the runways.

And Roksanda “showcases the creative processes coming to life”. That will include the vibrant splashes of paint that inspire the clothes as well as the intricate window displays “that build the narrative of the in-store experience”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 11, 2020","Copenhagen Fashion Week has released more details of what the event will look like on its new dates of August 9-12 with news that it will be in a ""hybrid"" format this time. The new format will mix digital experiences with physical events.This stops short of the fully digital approach being taken by events such as London Fashion Week this weekend, but also recognises that a completely physical fashion week isn't possible in the immediate post-coronavirus world.

“Although convinced that digital solutions can never replace the emotional and sensorial experience of seeing collections physically, this edition marks the kick-off of a new era for Copenhagen Fashion Week, where presenting and distributing shows digitally is now more crucial than ever,” said event CEO Cecilie Thorsmark. “We're extremely excited to see how this development can foster original creative material and cultivate new relationships with editors, buyers and consumers”.There will be both live and pre-recorded content from brands, with the revamped digital platform designed to “ensure that editors, buyers and consumers can access all material no matter where they are across the globe”.

“Over the past years we've put Copenhagen on the global fashion week map by giving our international guests an authentic Scandinavian fashion experience — right here in the capital city of Denmark,” Thorsmark added. “Now we're expanding our digital universe to share this experience using a hybrid format that allows access to Copenhagen Fashion Week despite travel restrictions — and we hope to reach many new audiences”.

To make the digital aspect work as well as it can, CFW has established a digital advisory board consisting of Ganni's founder Nicolaj Reffstrup; Stine Goya's CEO Thomas Hertz; Holzweiler's creative director Susanne Holzweiler; Hope's creative director Frida Bard; and creative agency Moon's CEO Martin Gjesing.

Meanwhile, the physical aspects of the event will have a centrally located physical hub, called CPHFW Hub, ""to bring the industry together for social events, presentations, talks, interviews and more”. Plus, as usual, there will be physical shows and presentations on the official schedule at unique venues selected by the individual brands.

The event is timed just after the Danish government on August 8 lifts the ban on gatherings of 200+ people. But CFW said this doesn’t mean returning to “business as usual for live shows and presentations, as precautions must be adhered to concerning, for example, social distancing”. 

Thorsmark said “brands with live showcases need to be flexible and adaptable in their planning”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 11, 2020","At a time when the health crisis has caused cities like London, Paris, Milan and New York to cancel their Fashion Weeks or hold them online, news has just come of plans to launch a first ever Fashion Week in Frankfurt, Germany in 2021.

The initiative has been made possible by the collaboration of three major partners: the city of Frankfurt, and two major trade show organizers, Messe Frankfurt and Premium Group.The city of Frankfurt am Main is aiming to establish itself as a future creative hub with the organization of a Fashion Week in the summer of 2021. The planned series of events will focus on two major challenges for the industry -- digitalization and sustainability -- and will feature a variety of presentation formats.

Runway shows will take pride of place in the new Fashion Week, as is the case in New York, London, Milan and Paris, with the presence of fashion houses as well as emerging brands. The long-term goal is for the city to become ""the new hotspot for the international fashion and lifestyle scene,"" point out the organizers.A core component of the new Frankfurt Fashion Week will be three leading fashion fairs: Premium, Seek and Neonyt, which is focused on sustainable fashion. Finally, there will also be conferences, with a focus on digitization and responsible fashion, and various events designed to highlight the city's creative scene in the fields of fashion, music, design and art, among others. 

In a year's time the new Fashion Week could be well on its way to establishing a place on the international fashion calendar.Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Jun 11, 2020","Google and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Sweden have partnered to create an environmental data platform set to help members of the fashion industry make more responsible sourcing decisions.A pilot of the platform was first announced by Google Cloud in collaboration with Stella McCartney, the first fashion brand to use the technology, at the 2019 Copenhagen Fashion Summit. There, Google Cloud and the brand said the technology would be used to provide a more comprehensive view into raw materials of clothing manufacturers' supply chains. 

In 2018, a similar tool was created by WWF Sweden and Ikea, made with a focus on analyzing the risk and impact of various textiles raw materials.Now, Google and WWF Sweden say the new platform will use all of these data types in order to further increase the accuracy and relevance of raw materials assessments. The platform will include a variety of raw materials, expanding beyond the range of cotton and viscose of previous versions.  

""Sustainability is a challenge that crosses industry boundaries, and we firmly believe that solutions require strong partnerships and collaboration,"" said Kate Brandt, Google sustainability officer.

""Our ambition is to fill fundamental data gaps by bringing greater accuracy to environmental reporting—ultimately moving toward more sustainable processes.""

According to Google, today's fashion industry accounts for 20% of wastewater and 2 to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, with the potential to rise by as much as 50% by 2030, Google said.

The company found that much of the industry's impact occurs at the raw materials stage in the production process, where supply chains can be highly fragmented, and gathering and assessing data at scale is a challenge.

""This project is an excellent example of how we can take valuable work with a long term partner like Ikea, collaborate with another strong WWF partner like Google to make that work even more powerful, and make it open source so that hopefully it can help with the transformation of a whole industry,"" said Håkan Wirtén, CEO of WWF Sweden.

In addition to Stella McCartney and Ikea, WWF and Google said they are in talks to bring the tool to a number of other fashion, luxury, denim, and athletic brands and retailers. According to the partners, the eco-friendly platform has the potential to be used on a standalone basis or as a complement to existing efforts.

"Jun 10, 2020","London Fashion Week (LFW) on Tuesday unveiled the calendar for its debut digital-only season this coming weekend, with the opening event kicking off on Friday morning.After Europe went into lockdown in March, the British Fashion Council – like its confreres in Milan and Paris – cancelled its June menswear season, and then converted it into a co-ed season. Due to social distancing, there will be no life runway shows with audiences present this weekend.
 
And, even if it’s a co-ed season, in the provisional calendar unveiled today, there are relatively few women’s designers listed. Though Sunday will feature a LFW Designer Diary by the brilliant Roksanda.“This new digital experience will work as a global meet-up point, offering interviews, podcasts, designer diaries, webinars and digital showrooms, providing the opportunity for designers to tell their stories and share their experiences from the last few months,” the BFC said in a statement.
 
Data released today by Oxford Economics underlines the continuing importance of fashion to the UK economy. In 2019, the British fashion industry directly contributed £35 billion to the UK GDP, a 9.38% increase from 2018, with the number of people employed by the industry remaining constant at 890,000. 
 
All told, the fresh British calendar lists 51 events; debuting with James Massiah on Friday morning at 12PM GMT and finishing with Mulberry’s virtual My Local, a live event at 8PM on Sunday. 
 
Only a half dozen events are actually proper live events or discussions; like a live interview with Hussein Chalayan; or GQ editor-in-chief and BFC Menswear Chair Dylan Jones doing a podcast with Tinie Tempah.
 Over a score of happening young designers will present new ideas, even if every presentation will be via pre-recorded video. The season does boast some real creative star power – the likes of Marques’Almeida, Lou Dalton, Bianca Saunders, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and Preen by Thornton Bregazzi.
 
Major players like Burberry, which in recent years has staged menswear and women’s wear together during the women’s season; or the city’s hottest fashion star Jonathan Anderson, who of late shows in Paris are not listed, will not be active this weekend.
 
Burberry is currently considering doing a mixed show in September - part physical and part digital, which may or may not involve a physical audience.
 
In what’s expected to be a highly experimental season, London can count on the support of major retail players: Farfetch plans to celebrate London; The Webster plans a 3D film with Natasha Zinko; John Lewis will stage a “catwalk challenge”; and there will be a creative conversation – also on film – between Drake’s London and Bruce Pask, the United States most influential menswear buyer.

The BFC also divided the long weekend into three parts: The LFW Schedule; and Explore Section and finally, Designer Profiles.
 
Explore will include Edward Enninful, Editor-in-Chief of British Vogue discussing systemic racism with London Mayor Sadiq Khan; Galeries Lafayette bringing 9 British designers to its Champs-Élysées store; Mount Street celebrating fashion with Erdem and Roland Mouret; and Tomfoolery, a London-based writer, performance artist and filmmaker presenting What Are You Drawing, a new piece commissioned for Vogue Italia June Edition.

"Jun 9, 2020","In a surprise announcement on Monday, Germany’s Premium Group and Messe Frankfurt revealed plans to launch a new fashion week in Frankfurt in 2021.The companies, both organisers of major trade shows, said Frankfurt Fashion Week will be “the new home of a forward-looking fashion and lifestyle community”.

Making its debut in summer 2021, the event will see trade shows, conferences, runway shows and events take place throughout the city.The initiative is backed by the City of Frankfurt am Main and the German state of Hesse with the aim of giving Frankfurt, one of Europe’s leading finance hubs, a fashion edge.

“Organising a Fashion Week in Frankfurt presents a unique economic opportunity for the City of Frankfurt am Main. We are expecting positive knock-on effects with the generation of more than €200 million per year for our hometown and the region,” said Peter Feldmann, the Senior Mayor of the City of Frankfurt am Main, at a press conference. 

A core component of Frankfurt Fashion Week will be its fashion fairs. Premium Group is relocating its entire portfolio of events including the Premium exhibition, Seek trade fair, Neonyt platform for sustainable fashion, and the FashionSustain and FashionTech conferences.

“Frankfurt Fashion Week is purposely aimed at a forward-looking, digital-savvy fashion and lifestyle community. B2B, B2C, B2P, P2P – all avenues are open. A synthesis of fashion, lifestyle, digital innovations and sustainability is always guaranteed to result in something new and unexpected. And that is exactly our aim,” said Anita Tillmann, Managing Partner of the Premium Group.

Organisers acknowledged that choosing Frankfurt was a rather surprising move, announcing the launch with an “Unveiling the Unexpected” slogan. 

“Frankfurt is a fresh, new location for this. We’re looking forward to it,” Anita Tillmann continued.

The launch of Frankfurt Fashion Week comes as Berlin Fashion Week continues its evolution to meet new needs and challenges. The event, sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, relaunched with a revamped format and new venue earlier this year after a period of struggles for direction.

Premium’s departure will be a significant blow to Berlin’s fashion credentials, as Premium and Neonyt are among the city’s leading trade fairs.  Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 8, 2020","Chanel staged its latest cruise collection – though without really voyaging anywhere – with an online video shot in a Paris studio made to look like Capri and presented on social media Monday at noon time in Paris.Entitled ""Balade en Méditerranée"" or ""A Trip around the Mediterranean', this 2020/21 Cruise collection presented lots of classic-with-a-twist Chanel looks, albeit with the more youthful and romantic slant favored by creative director Virginie Viard. The collection marked the first by a major fashion house presented on the web ever since Europe went into lockdown in March due to coronavirus.

The seven-minute video, shot by Julien Pujol, features four models – Camille Hurel, Karly Loyce, Cris Herrmann and Mica Argañaraz – captured virtually in a Paris studio at ease on the Mediterranean coast, strolling on a luxury hotel terrace or marching on a rocky shore; the volcanic island’s cliffs, the Bay of Naples and the Emperor Tiberius's ancient villa seen in the distant background.“Initially I had Capri in mind, where the show was supposed to take place, but didn’t happen in the end because of lockdown,” says Virginie Viard, “So we had to adapt: not only did we decide to use fabrics that we already had, but the collection, more generally, evolved towards a trip around the Mediterranean... The islands, the scent of the eucalyptus, the pink shades of the bougainvillea.”Pre-show, a look-book series of photos shot by Karim Sadli featuring Argentinian model Argañaraz and French-born Hurel set the scene. Watermelon pink tweed boucle suits worn with bolero jackets worn over snazzy sequined bras; bold, windowpane, check flared pants with matching tank tops; bubblegum pink cardigans worn with hot-pants. All capturing the “free, laid-back allure inspired by the legendary actresses of the 1960s” holidaying on the Italian and the French Riviera.

For cocktail hour: salmon pink leather pantsuits with double-breasted jackets or layered or wraparound bougainvillea dresses in fine transparent lamé. As for evening, semi-sheer, black chiffon batwing dresses, again over-sequined tops; see-through coatdresses paired with black bras.
Each of the gals accessorized with snazzy quilted bags in everything from denim to raffia; charming new mini micro matelassé purses, pearl earrings with double CC clasps and chain belts finished with crystals – as seen on multiple, tanned, flat-as-a-pancake model tummies.“A wardrobe that can be carried in a little suitcase on wheels, a shopper and an embroidered handbag,” added Viard about this multipurpose selection of easily transformable looks.

The actual video also included Brazilian-born Herrmann and Martinique-born black model Karly Loyce, the latter having sported her signature corn-row hairstyle. However, the video contained no references to the pandemic nor to the worldwide protests that have erupted since the death of George Floyd since policemen knelt on him for over eight minutes in Minneapolis.

The video ends with the tagline: ""available in boutiques from November 2020"".  Meaning Chanel’s strategy remains light years away from See Now Buy Now, as the house maintains its cadence of six collections a year: two couture; two ready-to-wear; the Métiers d’Art show and, of course, cruise.

The show had originally been scheduled for May 7 on the magical Mediterranean island. Like other major houses – Christian Dior, Gucci, Giorgio Armani, Prada and Max Mara – Chanel called off its cruise show due to the pandemic.  It also would have marked the debut show outside of France by creative director Virginie Viard, who succeeded Karl Lagerfeld after his death of February 2019.

The overall effect was a highly competent display of refined vacation fashion, backed up by soundtrack that mixed Venezuelan DJ Arca and an old French favorite for Chanel, Sébastien Tellier. However, ultimately, while sleek and smooth, the video only served to remind professionals what a modest alternative video clips are compared to an actual, live fashion show. Especially one by Chanel, whose massive spectacles inside the Grand Palais in Paris or historic events on islands in Dubai, Havana’s main avenue or in Remote Scottish castles, wrote the annals of recent fashion history.  

Over the weekend, Chanel released a video teaser of the collection: an 18-second film which referenced a five-day voyage in 1997 that Lagerfeld made to the island, when he photographed Casa Malaparte. Shot by Massimiliano Bomba, the short includes rocky beaches, crashing waves, seagulls and Capri’s wild, untamed Western coast – as well as the iconic villa. Famed for its reverse pyramidical stairway, the Casa Malaparte was the setting for Jean-Luc Godard’s classic 1963 film Le Mépris, a fashion favorite that starred Brigitte Bardot and the recently-deceased Michel Piccoli, about a beautiful woman’s growing contempt for her weak-willed husband’s lack of strength.

In a clever visual sleight of hand, Viard riffs on the movie’s racy poster, where Bardot lies on the roof of the villa in a pink bikini, igniting a furious scene of jealousy from her husband Piccoli. But where beauty proves fatal in Godard’s film about remaking the Odyssey for a vulgar American producer, it becomes insouciant and mysterious in Viard's hands.

This spring, all of Europe’s major fashion capitals – Florence, London, Milan and Paris – called off their scheduled runway seasons. Since then, they have all rejigged their various fashion weeks and now plan digital fashion weeks over the next six weeks. The next digital stop will be this coming weekend, when the debut London Fashion Week Digital stages its three-day online season, starting Saturday, June 13.

"Jun 8, 2020","The British Fashion Council is launching itself enthusiastically into two key projects that support charitable causes, with one focused on coronavirus safety and the other on reducing plastic pollution.As face masks become a must-have for most consumers, the BFC announced the launch of its Great British Designer Face Coverings: Reusable, for People and Planet campaign.

The joint campaign with Bags of Ethics will see the manufacture and retail internationally, of sustainable and reusable non-medical face coverings for consumers.They’ve been designed by six British labels, Halpern, Julien Macdonald, Liam Hodges, Mulberry, Raeburn and Rixo with the aim being (on top of keeping consumers safe) to raise £1 million for charity.

It said that 100% of sale profits will be split between NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund and Wings of Hope Children’s Charity.

The masks will be made at Bags of Ethics’ 100%-owned partner factories and will “provide a reusable and sustainable option for the environment with no single-use plastic”.

They’ll retail at £15 for three reusable masks with two protective pouches and will be for sale through the BFC’s own website “soon” as well as via Asos, Boots, and chains operated by John Lewis Partnership and J Sainsbury.

Moving on to the fight against plastic pollution, the BFC has also announced the launch of the Institute of Positive Fashion (IPF) website in recognition of World Ocean Day. 

The IPF has been developed to help the industry “lead in the goal to be more resilient, circular, equal and fair through global collaboration and local action”. 

It collates global resources, information and campaigns “to help businesses increase knowledge and embrace sustainable and people led best practices”.

As part of the commitment to the cause, Parley for the Oceans founder and CEO Cyrill Gutsch is joining the BFC advisory board and the IPF steering committee. And BFC chief executive Caroline Rush is joining the advisory board of Parley for the Oceans.

It all points to “a long-term partnership between these world-leading organisations to encourage positive change within the fashion industry”.

The group is planning pro-active projects for students, education and mentoring, with Parley providing dedicated missions for the BFC and IPF network. Meanwhile that network will help raise awareness for Ocean Conservation and support Parley on a campaign to phase out single-use plastics.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 8, 2020","The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) has announced a series of new initiatives, in an effort to counteract systemic racism within the fashion industry. ""Black people in this country are reeling from years of injustice stemming from institutional constructs such as slavery, segregation, mass incarceration, police brutality and economic and voter suppression,"" the CFDA said in a statement from chairman Tom Ford and president and CEO Steven Kolb. 

""Having a clear voice and speaking out against racial injustice, bigotry and hatred is the first step, but this is not enough. This is a deeply disturbing moment that speaks to us all. Our world is in deep pain. Our industry is in pain and it is not enough to simply say that we stand in solidarity with those who are discriminated against. We must do something.""The first two initiatives of the plan, launched on June 4, focus on creating what the CFDA called ""a racially balanced industry.""

To start, the CFDA will create an in-house employment program specifically focused on placing black talent in all sectors of the fashion business. This program will work to identify individual black creatives and pair them with companies looking to hire, the CFDA said.

The second initiative involves the creation of a mentorship program and an internship program focused on placing black students and recent graduates within established companies in the fashion sector.

The CFDA will also make a 'Diversity and Inclusion' training program available to its members. 
 
Finally, the organization said it will make immediate contributions and take up fundraising activities in support of organizations that advocate for the black community, including the NAACP and Campaign Zero, among others.
 
""We urge each and every member of the CFDA to take stock of their corporate structure to ensure that they have a racially balanced workforce and we challenge the retail sector of the fashion industry to ensure that their roster of brands and their product assortment is representative of the Black talent within the industry,"" the CFDA said. 

Ford, who was appointed as the CFDA's new chairman in March 2019, has significantly increased the diversity of the CFDA board, with the appointments of Virgil Abloh, Maria Cornejo, Carly Cushnie and Kerby Jean-Raymond, in September last year.

The appointments followed Ford's decision to add model Paloma Elsesser and Vogue.com fashion news director Chioma Nnadi to the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Selection Committee in March. 

In 2018, there were only 15 Black members of the CFDA, a number which has since increased to 19 out of a total of 477 members. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 5, 2020","Hosted by British designer Tan France and it-girl Alexa Chung, Netflix’s ‘Next in Fashion’ competition series will not be returning for a second season, despite it being one of the more interesting fashion shows on TV. The reality TV show, backed by luxe e-tailer Net-A-Porter, has been cancelled by Netflix shortly after making its debut at the end of January.

The story was confirmed by Tan France, telling Variety that “we’re not doing a second a season”. It remains unclear why Netflix has scrapped the series after just one season, although the internet entertainment giant is known to act quickly when shows don’t perform well or become too expensive. And of course, there's always the chance that the Covid-19 crisis could have had a part to play in its demise.‘Next in Fashion’ featured a strong line-up of industry experts as guest judges, including catwalk star designers such as Christopher Kane, Prabal Gurung, and Phillip Lim, plus major influencers like Instagram’s Eva Chen and Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director for Net-A-Porter.

The format began with 18 designers competing for a chance to become the next big name in fashion, win a not-insubstantial $250,000 prize and the opportunity to debut their collection with Net-A-Porter, a dream opportunity that most younger designers would leap at.

This competition wasn't about rank beginners though. All contestants had a solid fashion background, with several graduates from Central Saint Martins in London, celebrity clients like Beyoncé, Usher, Jay Z and Rihanna, and experience at established fashion brands including Stella McCartney and Alexander Wang.

Contestants also had various prestigious accolades among their achievements. Claire Davis won the Asos Fashion Discovery Award in 2016, Hayley Scanlan was named Scottish Young Designer of the Year at the Scottish Fashion Awards in both 2012 and 2014, and Korean designer Minju Kim was shortlisted for the illustrious LVMH prize in 2014.

Kim was ultimately crowned the show’s winner, and her designs launched on Net-A-Porter in February.

‘Next in Fashion’ was created and produced by theoldschool and executive produced by Robin Ashbrook and Yasmin Shackleton with co-executive producer Adam Cooper.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 3, 2020","French fashion designer Agnes b. has always been an optimist.It is what prompted her some 50 years ago to quit the world of fashion journalism and step onto the lowest rung of the design ladder.

She started the Agnes b. brand and opened her first boutique in Paris in 1975, followed by others across France as well as in New York, London, Amsterdam, Taipei, Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.Now 78 and still optimistic, she believes that a better world -- driven by young people -- will emerge from the coronavirus crisis.

Agnes b. spoke to AFP as part of our 'World Redrawn' series. She calls for the rich to ""share"" and insists we must not forget the urgency of looking out for the environment.


Q: We talk about 'a world before' and 'a world after'. Will habits change or will the world just go back to how it was before?

A: I have a positive and optimistic nature and I hope that this kind of step back will have changed perspectives. The question of how we share our land relies on our young people. They have real awareness which is great. Everything links. When the farmers called for help, the city people answered. There are young people who are going to settle on farms... There is going to be a fresh start. We will come out different.

Q: You place great faith in young people and their take on the environment. Why?

A: Young people are aware of the environment and know that it is more and more important. I have a lot of grandchildren and I see how concerned they are. We have to transform ourselves.

Q: France's economy is clearly taking a hit from the virus and quarantine measures. What does President Macron need to do to give some hope back to the French people?

A: I wouldn't like to be in the president's shoes at the moment. In France, we are programmed to criticise. The most important thing is to bring money into France, and the rich must share the wealth.

There are many poor people and many wealthy people who have too much money. I know what it means to be poor. Wealth is so badly distributed. There are people who are badly housed or homeless. The differences have always existed. We had the French Revolution but that didn't change anything.

Q: What help can we give to developing countries as the world economy struggles to find its feet again?

A: We must manufacture where it is necessary, where we can help. My line manufactures as much as possible in France but we have a policy of giving added value to countries like Peru, which produces alpaca, or Mongolia with its cashmere. There are also embroiderers in Madagascar. This is always my principle.

Q: Have you been making masks during the lockdown?

A: We have already made lots of masks. I designed them in unbleached, patterned canvas, with lipstick smiles in different colours. We also made 2,000 medical gowns to donate to suburban hospitals. We are mucking in as best we can!

"Jun 1, 2020","The Copenhagen Fashion Week has confirmed it will be business as usual. The event’s summer edition will still be staged in August, introducing the Spring/Summer 2021 collections, although it has been pushed back by a few days, and will be held on August 9-12, and not on August 4-7 as originally announced. According to a press release issued by the organisers on May 28, the decision reflects the agreement that was reached between the Copenhagen Fashion Week and the CIFF and Revolver trade shows. The Danish textile and apparel industry associations, Dansk Fashion & Textile (DM&T) and Wear, have also commented on the news.“Fortunately, Denmark as a whole is starting to get back to normal much more rapidly than forecast, enabling us to stage the Copenhagen Fashion Week on dates that are very close to those initially chosen. Of course, all our initiatives will be carried out in strict compliance with safety regulations,” said Cecilie Thorsmark, the fashion week’s CEO.

The easing of lockdown measures in the Scandinavian country is progressing smoothly enough that it will be possible to stage the event in physical format. In parallel, the CIFF and Revolver trade shows will also be held in the usual fashion. The organisers considered various alternative dates, in case the event had to be postponed, but they underlined that the issues of “health protection and industry preservation” weighed most in the balance.“We received huge support from the Scandinavian fashion industry,” said Thorsmark, who added that “the Copenhagen Fashion Week is a unique, essential platform for the promotion of our industry’s sales and exports, as well as for international collaborations. Sticking to the August dates is a decisive advantage in this respect.”A revised, upgraded formatThe Copenhagen Fashion Week’s official calendar has not been published yet, but all the regulars are expected to feature in it, like Cecilie Bahnsen with its lush romantic dresses, Helmstedt with its profusion of colours, media-savvy label Ganni and Norwegian label Holzweiler. Others, like Stine Goya, have announced they will give physical catwalk shows a miss, taking the opportunity to explore new presentation formats and communication styles. The next fashion weeks in London, Paris and Milan have instead all opted for a digital format. An online platform will also be operational during the Copenhagen event, but no details are yet available. Similarly, the Revolver show recently announced it is collaborating with B2B sales platform Traede, to launch a digital showroom catering to fashion labels, buyers and the media.

The Copenhagen Fashion Week is also set to continue to support projects promoting increased environmental sustainability. The projects selected have been revealed at the event’s last winter edition, as part of its 2020-22 action plan. Specifically, the Copenhagen Fashion Week wants to adopt a zero-waste policy and reduce its environmental impact by 50%. It also underlined its intention of becoming “a platform for change within the industry, rather than remaining a traditional event.” A few days ago, the Copenhagen Fashion Week signed Dries Van Noten's open letter to the fashion industry, in which a number of designers and industry figures asked for an adjustment to collection seasonality and for a change of the pace the sector has been governed by until now.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jun 1, 2020","The 2020 Hyères International Fashion and Photography Festival, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will be held on October 15-19, as always at the Villa Noailles venue. The 35th edition of the renowned emerging designer competition will be staged for the first time under the patronage of the President of France. T

he juries of the competition’s three categories - fashion, photography and fashion accessories - will be headed respectively by Jonathan Anderson, who besides leading his own eponymous label is also in charge of style at Loewe, by photographer Paolo Roversi and by Hubert Barrère, creative director of Chanel-owned Maison Lesage.Irish designer Jonathan Anderson has invited to the fashion prize jury star model Kaia Gerber, Olivier Lalanne, editor-in-chief of Vogue Homme International, Olivier Gabet, director of the Paris Museum of Decorative Arts, sound designer Michel Gaubert, London-based designer Grace Wales Bonner and Austrian designer Christoph Rumpf, winner of the 2019 Hyères Festival.

They have selected 10 finalists, which for the first time include a strong French contingent. There are five French names in fact, Aline Boubert, Xavier Brisoux, Emma Bruschi, Marvin M’Toumo and Céline Shen, competing alongside Katarzyna Cichy from Poland, Andrea Grossi from Italy, Timour Desdemoustier and Tom Van Der Borght from Belgium, and Maximilian Rittler from Austria.The fashion accessories jury includes, among others, comedian Nicolas Maury, accessories designer Yaz Bukey, dancer and choreographer Blanca Li, and actress and director Géraldine Nakache.

There is a strong French presence among the 10 designers competing in this category too: the trio consisting of Antoni Mongin, Dimitri Zephir and Florian Dach, Basque duo Juana and Ddiddue Etcheberry, plus Eva Verwicht, Félicie Eymard, Giulia Chebab, Oubadah Nouktah and Serena Cancelier. They will vie with US designer Carol Muthiga-Oyekunle, Joanne Guiraud from Switzerland and Jil Jander from Luxembourg.

This year, the Hyères Festival will feature a new fashion accessories prize, sponsored by Hermès. The €20,000 prize will be awarded to the designer creating the best leather jewellery. A new prize had also been introduced last year, sponsored by Chanel, one of the event’s leading patrons. It is endowed with a €20,000 purse and will be awarded to the best collaboration between one of the finalists and one of Chanel’s specialist craft ateliers.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 27, 2020","Few fashion designers have had as much impact in the past three decades as Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, aesthetically and commercially. 
Their blend of steamy Sicilian chic and haute Italian cinematic style; their invention of innerwear as outerwear; their powerfully suggestive ad campaigns; their bravura tailoring; and their high-color opulent alta moda have combined to make them an immense force in contemporary fashion.
 
Resolutely independent, Dolce & Gabbana still do not list their show on the official Milan runway schedule, even though they always the biggest show of any Saturday for men, and on Sunday for women. Held before oodles of VIPs for the past 15 years inside their custom-made show space, built within the former Metropol cinema in central Milan.The duo is currently mulling their next runway steps, with the haute couture seasons cancelled in Europe. However, they will likely participate in the unprecedented Milan Digital Fashion Week in mid-July, though like everywhere else in Italy the exact format is still being worked out.
 
Throughout their career, they have almost pointedly courted controversy, from their risqué ads to their controversial views, like suggesting children born thanks to IVF were “synthetic.”
 
Gutsy risk-takers, after building a huge business with their youth label D&G, they suddenly changed direction a decade ago, and launched Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda, creating a brilliant series of collections and shows, that rivalled, and even exceeded, anything seen on the Paris couture catwalks. Each winter, they stage their Alta Moda show in Milan, each July they take it on the road in Italy, with legendary displays in a Venetian palazzo; inner-city Naples street; on a private beach in Capri. Remarkably, despite closing down D&G in 2011, and focusing upmarket, their business continued to grow. The privately held house scored annual sales of €1.38 billion in the 12 months ending this March. Like everyone, they expect a tough 2020, recently telling Turin daily La Stampa that they expect to “lose a lot” this year due to coronavirus. 
Like every important designer they have been in lockdown for the past two months. But their house has been busy; opening a new revamped store on Canton Road in Hong Kong; and launching a new ad campaign modelled by Sofia Vergara for the Devotion bag, whose proceeds will go to support Covid-19 research.  
 
Their latest project – DGfattoincasa – meaning Made at Home, is a series of video shorts about Italian métiers de mode, or fashion artisanship, close to the hearts of Stefano and Domenico. It’s also a clever play on words on the Italian tradition of the workshop at home, where skilled artisans create rare handmade objects amid the warmth of family life. This month, Dolce & Gabbana have staged a series of digital workshops, inviting fans into appreciate the skills and techniques. While DGfattoincasa and a connected crow funding platform will help fund Fondazione Humanitas Per La Ricerca, a key research foundation. In a second wave, stars have joined DGfattoincasa, debuting with Helen Mirren, and with Monica Bellucci in the pipeline. 
 
So, FashionNetwork.com caught up with the duo, who have been in lockdown Milan, for a discussion of their latest plans and thoughts.
 
 
FashionNetwork.com: Where are you now?
Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce: We are at home like everyone, trying to keep the normal routine, otherwise it would be the end! We share this moment with the beloved ones and we talk everyday via Facetime. We spend days working, setting up home, cooking, reflecting a lot on what it’s happening. We try to be positive and not to be discouraged by daily counting of the pandemic. Sometimes we’d like not to read them…but we have to be always aware of what it’s happening in the world.
 

FNW: Why have you launched this new project now?
SG: We focused on the moment we’re living and on the place where we spend most of our time now: the home, that for us Italians is only one and it’s fundamental. We believe that its rediscovery as a value, a place to live, to share, but also as a space of work and creativity, will accompany us for long time. We thought that it would have been interesting to underline such an Italian way of thinking linked to our roots, to the Made in Italy and to the craftsmanship.
DD: We wanted to tell all this through video contents posted on our Instagram channel. So we asked to artisans, friends, singers, and collaborators to realize some videos with their phones creating a series of appointments making sure we could reach in an easy way all of our users.
 
SG: They can show what they want, it doesn’t matter what, it could be a cake; a crochet work; a painting; or a watercolor sketch; gardening or backing bread. The important thing is to do something, to gift a part of ourselves through creativity and the wish to tell a sentiment, an emotion, a nice story, in a moment like this one, in which we need to be strong, united, even if forced to be divided and locked in our houses.
 
SG&DD: Do you remember the old casa-bottega concept? Like a home and workshop together. When the magic of the hand-made merged with the warmth of the family. Here we’d like to recreate that emotion, that feeling of sharing which is part of us and of our DNA since always. Plus, we are even more proud and happy that the goal of the project is to continue the collaboration in the research to find a solution against the Covid-19 through a fundraiser for the Humanitas Foundation for Research also supported by Banca Intesa Sanpaolo. 
FNW: How has all this pandemic affected your creativity?
DD: Creativity is part of our life. We have continued to work, to think of new solutions, to draw sketches…Surely we miss the human touch and the planning but we go on! The other day I was talking with Stefano and we started to review fabric samples of old leather collections and we started to fantasize about what we could do today. We also concentrated on social network, developing the #DGfattoincasa project. We found a way to stay “connected”, as they say today, with the closest customers and friends…Creativity is the most important part of our work.
 
 
FNW: How will fashion change after Covid-19?
DD: We believe that fashion will finally recover its times, that seasonality that has always characterized it. Then we will have the pleasure of buying a coat in December and a t-shirt in July! We sincerely can’t wait for this. The collections will certainly also be reduced: less but better then. We are in Italy, we have the Made in Italy which is synonymous throughout the world with quality and beauty and that does not mean only fashion but also history, food, culture and art.
 
SG: Fashion must reflect reality, keep up with the desires of people who today, understandably, are even more changeable. It is difficult to make long-term predictions; we will do what we deem most appropriate considering that people, at this moment, don’t have a great desire to buy and this must be respected. 
FNW: Many people have talked about a reset button – do you think that is the case?
DD&SG: We don’t like the concept of a reset button. We have to accept the consequences of the things that we do. It’s wrong to delete what we did in the past. We, our fashion and our work are the result of our choices and our paths. Surely it’s right to reconsider ourselves, to understand what we can improve or just to do differently, but never to refuse the past.
 
 
FNW: What will we keep from this period and what will we discard? 
SG: I don’t think we will forget anything about this period of our life. We have lived surreal months feeling always different and contrasting feelings. I felt scared, other times, even if it seems strange to say, I felt a new energy inside, the desire to start again, to get involved again, finding the enthusiasm of the first years of work, when it was me, Domenico and one work room. We are Italian, we are like this, we don’t hold back and we are not afraid of working harder and making sacrifices.
 
DD: …In 36 years of work we have gone through many things, we will overcome this too. I don’t think we can really discard something from this difficult moment. Things happen, the system changes, we ourselves change, we evolve. This is life, it is normal for it to happen. The important thing is to move forward, not to lose positivity and to remain united. In addition, just to reiterate the concept of handmade by yourself, doing it yourself, at this time when there are no alternatives, is such a satisfaction. This is why we say that this is the right key to get something good from these times.
 

FNW: When do you next expect to stage a runway show?
 
SG&DD: We hope as soon as possible. All of us in the fashion system - designers, buyers, journalists, we need it! Runway shows represent the dream of fashion, and no one has found an alternative to this yet. At the moment we adapt to the present, we continue to work and we learn to live a new reality still made of love for the beauty, for the authenticity, and for the Made in Italy that we have to defend at all costs.

"May 27, 2020","Digital wholesale platform JOOR said on Wednesday that it will power the marquee upcoming summer fashion industry events London Fashion Week next month and Premium Berlin in July, as well as a number of autumn fashion events.It will “create unique landing environments for each show for brands to showcase and retailers to shop collections,” it said.

The LFW event takes place at the same time as the physical LFW Men’s had been scheduled (June 12-14). “It was incredibly important that we find a way at London Fashion Week to assist our brands, especially small and emerging ones, in this unusual time,” said Caroline Rush, British Fashion Council chief executive. “The access JOOR is providing will allow our members to continue their business relationships so they are well prepared for the recovery.” Meanwhile, Premium’s managing partner Anita Tillmann said: “We already had digital components to our shows with our app, which was successfully integrated into JOOR last year. The next logical move for us was to consolidate all our digital tools with JOOR Passport in order to achieve a seamless experience for our customers both on and offline. 

“Considering the current circumstances, this transformation became even more important. Digital is a huge opportunity for brands and buyers to remain capable and maintain international business.” 

As mentioned, the specific product these events will be using is JOOR Passport, which is “intended for the current market conditions of restricted travel as well as the post-pandemic era when physical events resume,” JOOR said. 

We’re told it centralises the trade show and fashion week experience “by creating a one-stop-shop for users: one place to upload data, one website to visit, one app to download, and one comprehensive experience. By digitising the interaction between brands and retailers, it enables a 365 day per year marketplace where retailers discover new styles and designers, and brands generate more connections”.

The company said it means brands can upload their seasonal lookbooks to unique profile pages and showcase their styles in virtual showrooms. 

And brands that have created images using its exclusive partnership with ORB360 “will be able to offer retailers 360 degree images that communicate every product detail for an enhanced shopping experience”.

And there are plans to continue this tech approach once the trade show and runway calendars start to get back to normal. The firm said that it will take an omnichannel approach. “The Passport mobile app will allow brands and retailers to manage their connections and appointments and place orders at these events,” it explained. “Retailers will use the universal app for all shows. Data stored in the app is carried from one event to the next to make planning and reconnecting easier than ever before.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 26, 2020","In the midst of the lockdown, designers are clamoring for a radical change in the fashion system; for less seasons and shows and later fashion week dates. But Carlo Capasa, president of the Camera della Moda, which controls the Milan runway season, still expects to have four Fashion Weeks per year in the future. And he wants to maintain their traditional calendar. 
“I continue to believe we should have separate menswear and women’s weeks twice a year, as they are different industries. Generally speaking, I think that this is the best way to keep the proper balance for these two divisions. They are two different industries, with different buyers, retailers, manufacturers. That’s true even if some specific brands may want to be different and stage co-ed shows, which is fine for them,” explained Capasa to FashionNetwork.com.
 
Due to the Covid-19, Capasa took the executive decision in April to cancel this June’s menswear season, partly replacing it with Milan Digital Fashion Week, which will take place from July 14 to 17.Within the past month, a group of designers led by Dries Van Noten, and including Craig Green, Tory Burch and Thom Browne have called for a slower approach to fashion, and a different calendar. While Gucci’s Alessandro Michele this week called for major reformulation of fashion. All of them suggesting that runway shows should be staged far closer to the actual dates when collections go into boutiques. However, Capasa insisted that Milan currently plans to maintain its usual runway dates for 2021: menswear in mid January and June; women’s ready-to-wear in late February and September.
 
“Of course, everything depends on controlling this terrible virus. But we hope to go back to those usual dates next year,” explained the president of the Camera, the latter being the body that decides of the official Milan calendar.
 
“Right now, everyone is very anxious to change everything. But change should be from inside ourselves. Let’s not forget, our business has been historically been working very well. Look at the number of young designers who are successful today. So as we say in Italian: Non buttare il neonato con l’acqua sporca. Meaning, don’t throw the baby out with the bath water.”
 
The Camera president gave multiple reasons for not changing dates.
 
“I totally disagree with the idea that you should hold shows right before you begin retailing the collection. First of all, it means that you show a collection that has been sold six months before. The show becomes a merchandising project not a creative expression. So, you will need a stylist and merchandiser to prepare it and you lose the importance of the designer,” he said.
 
“Secondly, if you milk the system, based on what you sold six months before, you become far less free in terms of creativity. We also believe that it is important to give magazines time to shoot collections and present new trends and inform the customers. And for the consumer to digest the new ideas. Magazines remain an important part of our community. If we help kill this market, there will only be Instagram left. Which is not a good idea,” he added.
 
“We do not believe in pure marketing. And, I think our French friends in Paris think the same. The future is not marketing, marketing and marketing. It is creating dreams. Plus, we do not accept the see now buy now idea, even if it can work for a few brands. When Burberry or Tom Ford tried this, it didn't work very well, did it?”
 
Capasa did, however, accept complaints by Van Noten and others that markdowns were having a very negative effect on fashion.
 
“Yes, stores were anticipating the season too much. There were too many markdowns. Look at what happened to Neiman Marcus. We need to reestablish the idea that our product has a value. Maybe, yes, there was too much overproduction in fast fashion. And, in our high quality world, we have unfortunately followed fast fashion too much,” he opined.
 
Capasa was gratified that Gucci has committed to participating in Milan’s July edition, even if it plans to skip the September season in Milan, which is expected to feature some live runway collections. 
 
“Our goal is to try to create the best opportunity for designers and brands to express themselves. Whether it is digital or physical,” stressed Capasa.
 
He noted that the novel July online season would in part be modelled on the Camera’s own path-breaking project back in February. When, due to the impossibility of Chinese buyers and editors coming to Milan, the Camera improvised the China, we are with you campaign, which provided live-stream shows, backstage interviews and commentary to fashion fans in China.
 
“Last season, our own digital version for China managed to reach 25 million people, which I think is a pretty good result,” said the Camera president.
 
Capasa also took pains to underline that in his view, grouping multiple collections into a fashion season in one city reduced the negative environmental impact.
 
“Showing 50 runway shows all together means that you reduce the carbon footprint, rather than everyone going off and staging their showing in multiple locations on many different days. That’s logical,” Capasa said.
 
Besides Gucci, Zegna has also confirmed that it will present a “phygital” show in in Milan in July. Capasa expects there to be “probably between 30 and 40 brands” participating in the summer season. Looking ahead, he expects September to be a mix of physical and digital.
 
“I believe in freedom; and that’s why we have to expect the world to be fluid. Where brands are free to do whatever they want. Some will have shows with a little audience; others a virtual show; or a fashion movie, or just a video walkthrough of the collection. Whether it takes one minute or 30 minutes to express your ideas, then that is your choice.”

"May 25, 2020","One day after Alessandro Michele, creative director of Gucci, revealed on Instagram that the brand would in future stage only two shows per year, the designer called publicly for a reformulation of the fashion calendar. He also indicated that Gucci will be present during the opening of the Milan digital season in July. But the designer closed off the possibility that the house would show in September, during the next official runway season in Milan – the Italian fashion capital. 
Speaking from his studio in Rome, Michele addressed some 20 international editors via the Converse software in a teleconference (or “virtual gathering”) on Monday, May 25.
 
“We were all in danger during this period due to the happening of something totally unexpected. It was the most mysterious of times. I was in lockdown in Rome, in my flat. And I found the time I never had before to focus on my feelings; my work; my creativity; our common future; and the future of people I work with in the company. We found time to be on our terrace with many plants and flowers… it made me realize I want to de-structure the fashion show and its many important elements,” explained Michele in Italian.He explained that his next collection will be called “Epilogue” and will be shown during Milan Digital Fashion Week on July 17 – in a digital format.
 
However, after a 15-minute speech with live English translation – during a subsequent question and answer session – when asked whether Gucci planned to show in September’s official calendar governed by the Camera della Moda, Italian fashion’s governing body, Michele demurred.
 
“I am not a deserter. I want to share with others my ideas… This autumn, we are hoping to construct a dialogue with the world. However, I don’t believe that making a collection every two months is a plausible way to work any more,” he explained, stressing that there was not really enough time to develop the collection.
 
“There should be a new system, and I don’t want to say they should be separately spring and fall… I want to be as free as possible. I would like that, after each show, all garments are immediately able to go to into stores and spend more time there,” he added, perched on a couch in his studio within a Renaissance villa just off the banks of the Tiber.
 
“I want to open a conversation, as each of us must design for a new time. Thus, I hope that this is the beginning of a discussion of a reformulation of the season, as well as a different way of doing things. We are in the the midst of reorganizing the system in which we work. I think we will have a regular calendar for September.  I think and I hope that.”
 
Reacting to the news, Camera President Carlo Capasa praised Michele for supporting the fashion community.
 
“I think Alessandro’s spirit contributes immensely to our community. He has indicated he will do something in our first digital season in July, which is great. However, this a moment where nobody is sure exactly what will happen next. So, here at the Camera, our rule is to try to give and create the best opportunity for designers to express themselves,” argued Capasa.
 
Besides calling for new dates, the designer insisted that multiple types of collections – such as pre-fall, capsule or cruise – should have different names. Hence the new title – Epilogue.
 
“I would like to stipulate new names for these collections, that emanate from classical music. That opens a new window to new horizons,” expounded Michele, a designer who has scored the fastest growth in revenue at any major luxury brand in the past half-decade.
 
However, whatever may happen, he is clear that he wants to radically reduce the number of shows he stages annually. 
“We will no longer do five shows – just two shows a year. Using the greatest talents to recount our ideas. We all need to be more elastic. I have done five shows, because I am hyper productive. But one day, doing that will wear me down. Having more time at home means my own ideas are far stronger,” stressed Michele, who added that during confinement, he had been reading about the collapse of civilization after the Roman empire by the arrival of barbarians, and the centuries-long, lengthy, subsequent restoration.
 
Looking ahead, he predicted multi-disciplinary shows will become the norm, involving elements of theatre, catwalk shows and digital technology.
 
“I really like shows. I am passionate about them. I want to implement them but also to reawaken them and reinvent them,” he concluded.
 
In his five years at Gucci, Michele has made a specialty of creating epic and artistic shows in such diverse locations as Westminster Abbey; an ancient Roman cemetery in Arles; or a Greek temple in Sicily.
 
When asked how he expects to entertain customers throughout the year after reducing the frequency of Gucci shows, the designer responded: “The fashion world is sort of like Woodstock. It is open to a huge audience, and followed by people who have often never entered our stores but follow us with great passion... I work for a group that allows great freedom to create new ideas.”
 
Ironically, Michele slightly stole the thunder on his voluble teleconference by posting a series of long diary entries on his Instagram account on Sunday evening, where he had already outlined his call for seasonless fashion.
 
In a series of poetic posts, Michele meditated on “the fragility of our creatural destiny,” and lamented that the fashion system “went too far.
 
“We usurped nature, we dominated and wounded it. We incited Prometheus, and buried Pan. So much haughtiness made us lose our sisterhood with the butterflies, the flowers, the trees and the roots. So much outrageous greed made us lose the harmony and the care, the connection and the belonging. We ravaged the sanctity of life, neglectful of our being a species. At the end of the day, we were out of breath.
 
“The greatest risk, for our tomorrow, is abdicating our responsibility for a true and necessary discontinuity. Our history is littered with crises that taught us nothing… I feel a need to renew a bond, purifying the essential by getting rid of the unnecessary.”
 
He finished by calling for a time that can bring forth a “new Epiphany…  A new path, away from the deadlines that the industry consolidated and, above all, away from the excessive performativity that today has no real raison d’etre.”

"May 21, 2020","In an unusual move, the British Fashion Council (BFC) and Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) have joined forces to call for a new approach and new ways of thinking once the coronavirus crisis has passed.It’s a call that seems to be addressed to the upper end of the market, although it also mentions that change is being sought “at every level”.

And the call includes a plea for fashion to slow down, produce less and let creativity become a key focus again.In a joint statement talking about “the fashion industry’s reset”, they said that the Covid-19 pandemic “is hitting the fashion industry from every angle and severely impacting all of the global fashion capitals. And while there is no immediate end in sight, there is an opportunity to rethink and reset the way in which we all work and show our collections”.

From the onset of the crisis, the two national bodies said they’ve “been in close communication, sharing feedback from their members and stakeholders”.

And they’re united in their “steadfast belief that the fashion system must change, and it must happen at every level”. They also said the changes “have been overdue for a while”.

So just what is the new thinking? For a start, they believe that there’s a need for “brands, designers and retailers, who are used to fashion’s fast, unforgiving pace, to slow down. For a long time, there have been too many deliveries and too much merchandise generated. With existing inventory stacking up, designers and retailers must also look at the collections cycle and be very strategic about their products and how and when they intend to sell them”.

They also see there being “a clear disconnect from when things arrive in-store to when the customer actually needs them” so “the delivery cadence should shift closer to the season for which it is intended”. 

They’re “strongly recommending” designers focus on no more than two main collections a year”, providing “our talents with the time they need to reconnect to the creativity and craft that makes our field so unique in the first place. A slower pace also offers an opportunity to reduce the stress levels of designers and their teams, which in turn will have a positive effect on the overall wellbeing of the industry”.

Does that mean the end of pre-collections? Not necessarily. The two groups said they understand the need for them “and the need to fulfil the delivery windows of the current pre-collections”. But they’re recommending “that these return to their original intended purpose, which was to offer the consumer beautiful clothes that carry the ethos of the individual brands but are not necessarily sufficiently fashion forward to warrant a show”.

Pre-collections have become major events in recent years for key labels such as Gucci, Chanel and Dior, putting extra pressure on other brands. But the BFC and CFDA are recommending that “when we are able to hold in-person events and showings, we would recommend that these presentations return to the showrooms”.

Another recommendation is, once things are back to some sort of normality, “that brands attempt to show during the regular fashion calendar and in one of the global fashion capitals in order to avoid the strain on buyers and journalists travelling constantly. This too has placed tremendous stress on the industry and significantly increased each individual’s carbon footprint”.

And mention of carbon footprints clearly brings the two bodies round to sustainability. They said that “through the creation of less product, with higher levels of creativity and quality, products will be valued and their shelf life will increase. The focus on creativity and quality of products, reduction in travel and focus on sustainability (something we encourage of the entire industry) will increase the consumer’s respect and ultimately their greater enjoyment in the products that we create”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 21, 2020","Famed English avant-garde fashion designer Gareth Pugh is gearing up to reintroduce audiences to his namesake brand.Via email, a representative from Rick Owens confirmed that Pugh recently bought back the 49% of his trademark that was sold to Rick Owens, as well as Owens’ Italian production partner Olmar and Mirta SpA, in 2006. The representative did not disclose any financial information. 

According to a report from WWD, the deal between Owens and Pugh - who was a mentee of the American designer and served as his intern at luxury fur label Revillon - was made on good terms, and Pugh plans to present a new collection as soon as September, in an inventive way that is still being planned. Given Pugh's track record, audiences can expect nothing less than the spectacular. The present moment, in which many leaders in the fashion industry is just warming up to the idea of revamping the modern fashion show, serves to highlight one of many ways Pugh has proved to be ahead of his time. See the designer's January 2011 collaboration with filmmaker Ruth Hogben for a video presentation of his collection at the Pitti Immagine showcase, as well as his New York City dance performance show in September of 2014. 

Pugh's last show was presented for spring/summer 2019.

“I’m really excited to start a new chapter,” Pugh told WWD. “We’re in a moment where we’re all being invited to invent the future, so for me it’s important to be part of that cultural conversation now more than ever.”

“Every designer should own his own name and I’m glad we were able to be any kind of help when he needed us,"" Owens told the publication. ""Gareth and [his husband Carson McColl] are family, and I love that we were all married for a minute. But we always will be.”

A Central Saint Martins graduate, Pugh held his first solo fashion show in 2006, and was awarded with the Andam award in recognition of his talents in 2008.

Outside of the runways, Pugh has created fantastical works for stage, screen and more. Through Hard and Shiny - the independent creative studio focused on fashion, film, stage design and experiential entertainment founded by Pugh and McColl in 2018 - he has collaborated with the likes of Christina Aguilera, Cardi B, the New York City Ballet and The Royal Opera House in London. 

Pugh also has an open-ended creative partnership with choreographer Wayne McGregor, and has designed pieces for entertainers like Kylie Minogue and Beyoncé. The designer's works have been displayed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 20, 2020","The Saint Heron Agency is partnering with the New School for an immersive virtual festival to celebrate graduating students at the Parsons' School of Fashion.Unlike traditional graduation ceremonies, ""Here and Now"" will take place from the months of June to August, with a programme of online lectures, special performances, films screenings, design workshops and mentorship sessions.

Details about the online event are still scarce to this date, although the Saint Heron Agency has announced that American contemporary artist Jacolby Satterwhite is creating a new 3D installation for the occasion.The installation, known as ""Metonymy,"" will host the final projects of more than 300 graduating students from the School of Fashion at Parsons.

""As the world confronts the challenges of our current global crisis, fashion and design communities must embrace new ways to pause, evolve, and adapt. These challenges open up opportunities to expand growth in our creativity and innovation-two expressions at the core of Saint Heron as well as Parsons' students,"" the Saint Heron Agency said in a statement.

Solange has close ties with the Parsons School of Design, as the Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter was honored ""for her notable contributions to the music and fashion industries"" at the 70th annual Parsons Benefit in 2018.

While it is still unclear whether Solange will participate in ""Here and Now,"" Beyoncé and Taylor Swift are the latest entertainment icons celebrating the class of 2020 in YouTube's virtual graduation ceremony.

""Dear Class of 2020"" will also include Lizzo, Janelle Monáe, Lana Condor, Yara Shahidi, Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Hasan Minhaj, Andy Cohen, Billy Porter, Megan Thee Stallion, as well as Bill and Melinda Gates.

The multi-hour event will be headlined by former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, who will each deliver individual commencement speeches, as well as a joint message to graduating seniors.

""Dear Class of 2020"" will be livestreamed on Saturday, June 6 on the YouTube Originals channel and YouTube's Learn@Home site.

""I've always loved joining commencements -- the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can't get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones,"" Obama said on Twitter.

"May 20, 2020","Amid uncertainty and unanswered questions about the future of retail, the world’s top fashion capitals are being forced to reinvent their fashion weeks. Technology and a shift towards digital formats allow them to plan ahead without the constraints of social distancing measures. But for lesser known fashion weeks, the challenge of reinvention is even harder. The fight to earn the respect of the international fashion community was a tough one even before Covid-19. Amidst a global pandemic, it’s a challenge only the brave will accept.Among them is Sofia Tchkonia, the entrepreneur who launched Tbilisi Fashion Week in 2015. Originally due to take place this month, the event has been postponed until further notice. But rather than admitting defeat, the decision involves ambitious plans for the future of the event. One of the key targets is to emerge stronger from the crisis.

“Many people don’t know that Georgia is a country. My main goal is to raise awareness about Georgia through fashion and art, and present our creativity and culture to the world,” Sofia Tchkonia told FashionNetwork.com in an interview. Her ambitions include launching a 27,000 sq m Art and Culture Center in the former Coca-Cola factory in Tbilisi.The industrial space will become an events venue where local designers, photographers and artists can showcase their work. With an aim to boost Georgia’s creative industries, the building will also feature bookstores, cafes and children’s studios. And two times a year, the space will be transformed to host Tbilisi Fashion Week, starting next autumn if international travel permits.

“Georgia’s new generations need support to express their originality and creativity. They need motivation to continue doing what they are doing. Motivation has to be nurtured by their country and the people who live and work there,” said Tchkonia. She added: “Creative people need to feel that their work serves a purpose and know that what they do is important to them, the country and society.”“Events of this kind are an opportunity for artists of all disciplines to be discovered,” the event's organiser says. For Georgian designers, it offers an opportunity to earn a place on the global map. Tbilisi Fashion Week embraces the country’s cultural influence and the gastronomic and touristic virtues of the area to entice more visitors. This means that the strategy is firmly anchored to the physical format. And as such, it stands out from other smaller fashion weeks which are opting to host purely digital formats due to the coronavirus. “This space brings together art and culture, which is of key importance to advance the country and spark more interest from both locals and foreigners,” Tchkonia concluded.

Georgia, the birthplace of Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia, is still a country in the process of building its fashion credentials. Lacking resources, financing and fashion schools, the sector is making a name for itself through Tbilisi Fashion Week. In less than five years, the showcase has managed to multiply its visitor numbers and attract buyers from luxury retailers including Net-A-Porter and MyTheresa.com. Its latest edition presented both emerging Georgian designers and international names, such as Anouki or Datuna Sulikashvili. And thanks to a partnership with MBFW Madrid, the event even featured an exceptional catwalk show from Spanish designer Dominnico.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 19, 2020","Adorned with intricate designs of orchids, camellias and Chinese characters symbolising good luck, the stylish silk masks created by Chinese fashion designer Zhou Li have become coveted items during the coronavirus outbreak.Zhou, whose Dejin fashion brand recently exhibited at China Fashion Week, has been making embroidered silk masks equipped with high specification N95 air filters since February, providing the fashion-conscious with protective options.

“When the situation turned very serious, we saw that many people needed to change their masks every four hours,” said Zhou, explaining how she came up with the idea for the reusable masks made from colourful Chinese silk.Now, as China and other countries lift restrictions, Zhou expects masks will be a necessity for the foreseeable future. She has adapted hers for summer, making them with a thinner silk that allows for better breathability in warmer weather.

The 55-year-old, who is director of design at Shandong Sunbird Garment company, enjoys adding traditional Chinese motifs to her work.

A yellow mask displayed at a workshop in Beijing’s art district is decorated with golden orchids, representing a harmonious family with abundant wealth and many children.

Zhou is also designing personal protective suits, many also featuring flowers, after her friends asked for stylish outer wear to use during air travel.

The company can make around 600 masks a day, and sells them online at 118 yuan ($16) a piece. Zhou plans to market them by inviting influencers to participate in live-streaming on e-commerce platforms, and hopes to expand sales in England and Italy.
“I hope people can wear my masks that protect them, make them look beautiful, bring them good luck and keep them safe,” she said.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"May 19, 2020","Barcelona is introducing new formats for its fashion weeks. Following the postponement to September of the Valmont Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week, which will adopt a hybrid format, Catalan fashion show 080 Barcelona Fashion has done the same, pushing back its dates and transitioning to a digital-only event.“080 Barcelona Fashion, which in recent editions has strengthened its commitment to sustainability, new technology and innovative show formats, has decided its next edition will be staged as a digital event, in order to respond to the industry's current needs, prompted by the health crisis, and at the same time to progress towards new scenarios for fashion,” said the event organisers in a press release. 080 Barcelona Fashion is backed by the Catalan government via Barcelona’s trade, crafts and fashion council (CCAM).

"May 15, 2020","Graduate Fashion Foundation, the organiser behind Graduate Fashion Week, has revealed that no catwalk awards will be given out this year as a result of the coronavirus crisis.The event, which was due to take place in June, had to be cancelled for the first time in its 29-year history, but Graduate Fashion Foundation said it remains committed to supporting talented fashion graduates.

A series of new opportunities has been announced, with events taking place both in digital and physical form. The decision to remove the five catwalk awards this year was taken due to the halt in manufacturing and the closure of university studios. But GFF said four new prizes have been created to celebrate the creativity of students during the lockdown: the Fashion Illustration Award, Fashion Range Plan Award, Technical Drawing Award and Fashion Concept Award.

A further title, the Adaptation Award, has been added in recognition of students’ resourcefulness and problem-solving skills during this unprecedented time.

The top 10 student shortlists for each award will be announced on 10 June, with final judging taking place in July. Winners will be announced in the Autumn at an event in London. GFF said the event is being organised with a flexible approach to take into account social distancing restrictions and government guidelines, and is currently scheduled for September, but could take place anytime between September and December.

The event will also provide a platform for 38 UK university partners to showcase portfolios of work, with tutors in attendance to speak with industry attendees about the work on show.

Meanwhile, 318 design students from the UK and abroad will be offered a chance to showcase their collections across three new opportunities, a GFF Showroom, a professionally-curated fashion presentation and a catwalk show. These events will be either physical or digital, depending on social distancing restrictions.

Finally, GFF has launched a new webinar series to bring the industry’s guidance and advice exclusively to the homes of 2020 graduates. Speakers include former editor-in-chief of British Vogue Alexandra Shulman and British photographer Rankin.

Acting chair of Graduate Fashion Week Douglas MacLennan said: “Out of adversity, comes innovation. The Graduate Fashion Foundation rose to the unprecedented global challenge, by placing an emphasis on listening to the 2020 graduating student needs and those of our academic members. In order to create the foundation’s most innovative and exciting series of launch activities to date. 

“The annual ‘Graduate Fashion Week’ launch period was historically held over a few days, in 2020 the activities will now be held over a number of months with a series of exciting new style activities.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 15, 2020","Vogue, Amazon Fashion and the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) have teamed up to launch a digital storefront in support of American designers, dubbed 'Common Threads: Vogue x Amazon Fashion'. Launched on Thursday through Amazon.com, the store offers pieces from a variety of American designers, including many small and medium-sized CFDA member businesses, the CFDA said. Through the initiative, the designers will have the opportunity to leverage Amazon's customer base and fulfillment network to boost sales during the pandemic.

At first launch, the digital platform will offer apparel and accessories from 20 brands, including Adam Lippes; Adam Selman Sport; Alejandra Alonso Rojas; Batsheva; Brock Collection; Chloe Gosselin; Danielle Frankel; Derek Lam 10 Crosby; Edie Parker; Gigi Burris; Hunting Season; Jonathan Cohen; Krewe; Morgan Lane; 3.1 Phillip Lim; Rebecca De Ravenel; Ryan Roche; Tabitha Simmons; Tanya Taylor and Victor Glemaud.

“I’m thrilled to announce this partnership, and want to thank Amazon Fashion...for so quickly sharing its resources to aid American designers affected by the pandemic,” said Anna Wintour, Vogue editor-in-chief.

“While there isn’t one simple fix for our industry, which has been hit so hard, I believe this is an important step in the right direction.”

In order to provide further support to the U.S. fashion community, Amazon Fashion will donate $500,000 to A Common Thread, the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund’s initiative supporting members of the American fashion industry who have been impacted by the pandemic. 

“The CFDA is grateful for Amazon’s very generous support,” said Steven Kolb, president and CEO of the CFDA.

“The $500,000 donation to A Common Thread allows us to increase the number of micro-grants for brands impacted by Covid-19.

"May 15, 2020","Following Saint Laurent's announcement that it is pulling out of the Paris runway cycle in order to ""take ownership of its calendar"" and Giorgio Armani's revelation that it is moving away from the French capital so as to show its Armani Privé haute couture collection in Milan next January, now it's Valentino's turn to switch up its show schedule.

The Italian house has announced that it will show its next men's and womenswear collections in September and is preparing a special project for its haute couture offering in July. First revealed by the brand's creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, in an interview with Milan's MF Fashion, Valentino has since confirmed the decision to FashionNetwork.com. 

As the brand has chosen to host a coed event in September, it will not participate in the digital menswear fashion week being organised in Paris from 9 to 13 July. ""We still do not know what format – presentation or runway show – this men's and womenswear event in September will have, nor do we know the location,"" explained a spokesperson for the label. On top of this, Piccioli is currently developing a special event for his next haute couture collection, promising an original format about which no further details have been revealed for the moment.

"May 13, 2020","This Wednesday, fashion NGO Redress announced the finalists for its annual sustainability-focused fashion design competition.Ten zero-waste and upcycling experts from nine regions will vye for the menswear and womenswear awards in the Grand Final taking place in September 2020 in Hong Kong.

The designers used a combination of zero-waste, upcycling and reconstruction design techniques to create their innovative, sustainable designs.The five finalists competing for the womenswear award are Juliana Garcia Bello from The Netherlands, Laura Krause from Albania, Grace Lant, from Hong Kong, Tong Jianlong from Mainland China and Ruth Weerasinghe from Sri Lanka.

And the list of menswear finalists includes Marie-Eve Aubry from Canada, Beatrice Bocconi from Italy, Inhwa Jin from Korea, Ngoh Ha Thu Le from Vietnam, and Gönül Yigit from The Netherlands.

The designers were chosen from hundreds of applicants from 46 regions  by a judging committee that included the likes of Kevin Bailey, executive VP of VF Corporation, Asia Pacific; Fashion Revolution co-founder Orsola de Castro; and fashion writer Susie Lay.

The Menswear Prize winner will receive a career-changing mentorship with experts at VF Corporation, and Womenswear Prize winner will have the opportunity to sell a capsule collection with The R Collective, one of the world’s fastest growing up-cycling fashion brands, available on Net-A-Porter.

Now in its 10th cycle, Christina Dean, founder and chair of Redress, highlighted the importance of hosting the competition amid the pandemic.

She said:  “Fashion is in crisis. Covid-19 has devastated the business, the balance sheets and is affecting creativity on the drawing board. Meanwhile, fashion’s already staggering waste rates will likely spike due to shocking retail performance and dislocated supply chains that have stranded inventory and materials globally. 

“Only the toughest and most talented designers will survive this crisis, and those designers who can up-cycle waste materials, like our 10 Redress Design Award Finalists, are already ahead of the pack as they enter a new fashion industry.”

Desiree Au, publisher of, Vogue Hong Kong, added: “Fashion is undergoing a tremendous cycle of change and Redress is on the forefront as a platform where new ideas take shape - to make the world more sustainable and fashion more responsible.”

"May 13, 2020","The British Fashion Council (BFC) on Tuesday revealed the names of the first 37 designer brands to receive financial support from its Covid-19 crisis fund. 
Each one of the British fashion businesses will receive up to £50,000 from the fund, along with mentoring from executives partnering with BFC like LVMH, Lloyds, Farfetch and Instagram. The initial group includes such noted creative houses and designers as Ahluwalia, Chalayan, Charles Jeffrey, Craig Green, David Koma, Liam Hodges, Matty Bovan, Phoebe English, Richard Quinn and Roksanda.
 
The funds will be allotted according to “viable businesses depending on their urgency and capability to come through and thrive post crisis,” the BFC said in a release. A portion of funds will also go to students.“Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen an astonishing amount of applications come through from British designer businesses all over the country, asking for help to survive the crisis. The need for support is immense. Our hope is to re-open the fund for future rounds, to help as many businesses as possible, and ensure the future growth and success of the British fashion industry,” said BFC Chief Executive BFC Caroline Rush.
 
The BFC also estimated that up to £100 million will be needed to help protect this decade’s generation of talent over the next 12 to 18 months. The fund will re-open for further rounds of applications so that more meaningful support can be given every time the £500,000 milestone is reached. Donations towards the next round of funding have already been received from Alexander McQueen, Browns, Clearpay and the Coach Foundation.  
This round of financing came from pooling the BFC talent support grants that would've normally gone to aid runway shows or business growth, as well as promotion of fledgling brands sourced from NewGen and the Vogue Designer Fashion Fund.
 
BFC also noted that this year’s BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund had already completed its judging process and had exceptionally decided to distribute the award among six nominees: David Koma, Rejina Pyo, Charles Jeffrey, Metier, Michael Halpern and Alighieri.
 
All applicants that did not receive funding through this round will be informed on new rounds of funding, government support schemes and webinars to collectively help businesses in these challenging times. 
 
“While one million pounds of funding is a great start, the scale of the need is much greater and BFC has called on both Government to step in to work with them on significant industry stimulus, and on the industry and individuals to support the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund through donations, so that more businesses can be supported at this time,” the BFC added.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 13, 2020","A group of fashion CEOs, retailers and designers, including such luminaries as Dries Van Noten, Tory Burch and Craig Green, have called for a major rethink in fashion deliveries, and greater efforts to encourage sustainability in an open letter to the industry.
 “Recently a group of us from across the global fashion industry, from CEOs to buyers and creative directors, came together in a series of conversations with a shared vision; to discuss ways in which our business needs to transform,” the group of nearly 40 noted industry leaders wrote, in an open letter made available to FashionNetwork.com.
 
“We agreed that the current environment although challenging, presents an opportunity for a fundamental and welcome change that will simplify our businesses, making them more environmentally and socially sustainable and ultimately align them more closely with customers’ needs,” they added.The revolutionaries even call for further signatories, via the web address: forumletter.org.
 
The group emerged from a series of Zoom conferences this month, uniting a surprisingly broad array of figures including fashion forward designers, dynamic executives, influential big boutique owners and even online retailers.

The first of their two key demands is for fashion to begin “adjusting the seasonality and flow of both women’s wear and menswear goods, starting with the Autumn/Winter 2020 season.” 
They call on fashion to “put the Autumn/Winter season back in winter,” by retailing those collections from August to January; while also selling Spring/Summer in summer, by which they mean February to July. The letter also demands “a more balanced flow of deliveries through the season to provide newness but also time for products to create desire.”
 
A related goal is to greatly reduce the bane of all designer houses, discounts, in order to allow more full-price selling.

This fledgling fashion forum also calls for greater “sustainability throughout the supply chain,” and a new sales calendar, which they claim would lead to less unnecessary product; less wasted fabrics and inventory, and less showrooms. While they also envision greater use of digital showrooms and suggest a review of fashion seasons, though without making any specific suggestions.
 
However, while many of the suggestions seem logical, industry veterans will be only too well aware that younger designer brands have been belly aching for decades about department stores putting their clothes into chains far too early each year. Due to competition to have key collections ahead of rival retailers, stores have gradually advanced the arrival of new clothes earlier and earlier over the decades. 
It’s also very noticeable that none of the giant luxury groups in Europe – LVMH, Kering, Chanel, Hermes or Prada – are signatories to this document.
 
Nonetheless, the missive concludes with a call to arms.
 
“Working together, we hope these steps will allow our industry to become more responsible for our impact on our customers, on the planet and on the fashion community, and bring back the magic and creativity that has made fashion such an important part of our world,” it reads.
 
The letter is also signed by the likes of Joseph Altuzarra, Linda Fargo of Bergdorf Goodman, Erdem Moralioglu, Gabriella Hearst, Shelly Corkery of Brown Thomas, Marine Serre, Mary Katrantzou, Michael Kliger of Mytheresa, Pierre-Yves Roussel and Rodrigo Bazan of Thom Browne.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 11, 2020","Observing stay-at-home measures in Palm Beach, Florida, Mark Badgley and James Mischka, founders and designers of the American fashion brand, have taken advantage of their time of social distancing to produce a series of illustrations on the theme of the ongoing global health crisis. Having been shared on Instagram and the brand's website, the illustrations are now being sold in an online auction that is set to run until May 17. Proceeds from the sale will be donated to the charity Feeding America.Mark Badgley and James Mischka have created no less than 35 illustrations to support and encourage those who are battling the coronavirus around the world with a creative and artistic endeavor. The series of illustrations, which is on display on the brand's Instagram, is now the focus of an online auction. All of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the charity Feeding America, which is working hard to provide food to vulnerable populations who risk going hungry during the pandemic. 

The 35 illustrations can be viewed in the brand's online store (Badgleymischka.com). Those who wish to obtain one of these works simply have to click on the ""Place Bid"" button for an individual illustration, and they will be automatically redirected to an online auction organized by eBay for Charity. Once they are sold, the illustrations, which have a starting price of 100 dollars, will be personalized before being framed and shipped by Badgley Mischka.Focusing on the theme of the global health crisis, the works highlight emotions and feelings that many of us have experienced in the current period. One of the more recent entitled ""Breathe"" shows a young woman assuming a Zen posture while wearing a glamorous mini-dress, ""Don't Forget Your Mask"" shows another equally elegant woman wearing a mask that matches her outfit while examining a butterfly. A third, ""Back Off,  Covid-19"" shows a slender model in a glamorous backless evening gown.

"May 11, 2020","Once upon a time if you wanted to get ahead you got a hat.

Now if you want step outside your front door you need a mask.In a matter of weeks, the coronavirus has upended the Western wardrobe and challenged its deepest codes about freedom, comfort and self-expression.

From being a curious oddity seen only on Asian tourists, masks have suddenly become as essential as socks -- a signal of civic virtue and a passport to many public spaces denied to the bare faced.""When you wear one you are saying, 'I'm not a threat',"" said French designer Stephanie Coudert, who made her name with Paris haute couture.

""It's a civic gesture.""

Yet when she sat down to design a mask, one thought kept coming back to her.

""It's a muzzle. It is hard to get away from that,"" Coudert told AFP.

Fashion's Mr Zeitgeist, Louis Vuitton's Virgil Abloh had no such reservations, rushing out a simple black mask emblazoned with the arrow logo of his own Off-White label for $92 (87 euros) a pop.

It immediately sold out and has since become the most coveted style accessory in the world, according to trends monitor the Lyst Index, with some now selling secondhand for four and five times that.

By contrast, Coudert is selling her couture masks for eight euros.

""It a social choice for me,"" she said. ""I think we are all asking ourselves how we can be useful.""

Not surprisingly, she is working flat out to keep up with demand. Indeed Lyst said internet searches for masks have gone up five times since the beginning of the year.Early adopters Even before the virus raised its ugly head, masks were coming in from the fashion cold.

American designer Rick Owens was ahead of the curve, masking many of the models in his Paris spring summer collection two years ago and giving out masks to everyone at the show.

Back then Owens had pollution and climate change in mind. Yet he was reluctant to revive the idea even as the virus casts its shadow on the last Paris fashion week in March.

""I would hate to capitalise on it,"" he said. ""I'm sure people will and it will be sensational on Instagram.""

Owens was not alone in seeing a fashion future for masks. Rising French designer Marine Serre was an early adopter and they have also featured in recent Gucci, Vetements and Japanese designer Takahiro Niyashita's The Soloist shows.

But many of the big houses remain cautious and deeply ambivalent about whether masks will be part of our fashion future.

Style historian Olivier Saillard warned masks were ""an accessory we all want to be quickly rid of"".'Rather vulgar'It could be seen as ""rather vulgar to make money from putting a logo on a mask,"" he told AFP.

While Dior, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga have been making free masks for French medical staff and care workers, there is a reticence about going any further.

Chloe, a bag and accessory designer for a fabled French house, told AFP from the window of her Paris apartment that she had been asked to toy with some ideas around masks.

""It's tricky,"" she said. ""But we could be wearing them for many months or even years, so why not make them into a fetish object. It is what we humans do.""

Coudert said that it we had to live with them, it was best to make masks that were clever, comfortable and calming.AIDS analogy ""I dropped the idea of making ones with a seam down the middle because you can look like a warrior in them. We don't need to make people any more nervous now,"" said the couturier.

For the anthropologist Frederic Keck, masks have long been regarded in the West as ""archaic and oppressive"", a prejudice that will be hard to shake.

Indeed, covering the face is technically illegal in France under a controversial ""burqa ban"" aimed at Islamic face coverings.

In a think piece in the French daily Le Monde, Keck compared masks and the constraints Covid-19 has imposed on social interaction to the ""loss of innocence that AIDS brought to love making"" in the 1980s.

Despite all the downsides, historian Saillard sees one positive to be drawn from having to wear masks.

""In an era which is all about ego... a little bit of self-effacement is maybe not all bad,"" he said.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"May 7, 2020","Jean Touitou, the founder of cool and quirky Paris brand A.P.C., has issued a long open letter to the fashion industry, defending his decision to cancel his Paris runway show in March and calling for a great sense of community.A.P.C. infuriated many senior French fashion executives when it called off its runway show, scheduled for March 2 in the Paris catwalk season. Many perceived the decision as lacking in esprit de corps, even as the world slowly woke up to to the impact of coronavirus. Only one other house, Agnès b., pulled its show in a calendar of some 80 shows.
 
However, in his letter Touitou insists he is “extremely proud” to have cancelled that show, “to safeguard the health of my teams and guests. I think that I can claim a certain form of morality.”Known for his sharp wit, and loquaciousness, Touitou can be as wordy as the Unabomber, albeit with a softer tone. Below, we reproduce his entire letter, over 1,400 words-long, to let readers judge for themselves.
 
It is entitled: For a Reasonable Utopia Amidst Monstrous Chaos Everywhere
 
The ongoing catastrophe is making me refocus and ask myself: 
WHY A.P.C.? 
I started thinking about the idea of A.P.C. well before the brand debuted its “Hiver 87” labelled collection in 1986. 

It was around the mid-80s, I remember. Women had huge shoulder pads in their jackets. They wore a sort of absurd shawl over ONE shoulder. Men had trousers that were too wide and high-waisted. Only the (already) old punks were elegant. 

What I’m trying to say is that I was disgusted and revolted. When the famous “Palace” nightclub had reached the height of its popularity, I was tagging “DEATH TO DISCO” on the walls of the Les Halles neighborhood in Paris. For me, everything in the world that I lived in needed to be rethought and redesigned. I couldn’t breathe anymore. Everything was suffocating me. 

(Note for readers who may be shocked by this attitude: I secretly loved the musical gems and vital energy of disco; I listened to this music a lot when I would go to New York. At the time, I was selling post-psychedelic rock type vinyls “by mail order” from a small office on rue Saint Honoré in Paris. 

I would find them in the U.S. in warehouses full of unsold stock and I would send them out from the warehouse of a record dealer friend, located on the western end of New York's Canal Street. 

To keep everyone in a good mood in this workplace, the music was disco, of course. It lifted me. I was at the center of a contradiction, because I loved a music that I forced myself to hate. I continued my mission because, without this warehouse, I couldn’t send Remains and 13th Floor Elevators albums, to mention the most obscure bands, to France. 

Obviously, what tortured me during this period wasn’t that people might like to dance, but that it was obscene to talk about politics and philosophy during dinner. Everything had to be fun all the time -- even though, behind the scenes, everything was a mess.

I had to get away from this lack of perspective and, since I was never tempted by self-destruction or drugs, I looked for a way to transform my destructive energy into something good, while avoiding all sorts of compromises with social modes and fashion cliques. 

I wasn’t alone in this, but let’s just say that our numbers were limited. 

So, I tried to create a haven of esthetic dignity and I called it A.P.C. 

To finance my venture, I designed and produced collections that were far from my liking. It’s pretty funny when I think about it: truckloads and truckloads of python-printed leggings financed the development of my raw jeans and slim-shouldered woven wool suits. 

Since then, almost nothing has improved: in addition to all the evils that already existed in the 1980s, the oceans now overflow with plastic waste and global warming is causing phenomena that are making this planet harder and harder to live in and preserve. 

The fashion world has been subjected to things that are difficult to accept: impossible schedules, the increased power of advertising and money in general, superficial creatures conveying values that, strictly speaking, are disgusting—those of an easy, marvelous and enchanting life that is totally fake. Fashion has really become the opium of the people and celebrities have attained the status of Messiahs. 

A whole lot of water has gone under the bridge since the feminist movement of the early 1970s, represented for example by Delphine Seyrig. Progress was made, of course, but despite this, too many women are still treated as objects. 

Some of the de-objectification efforts of the “second sex” were swept away by fashion, which has become a libidinous relationship with merchandise. 
I’ll stop there. 
 
With the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, and still weighed down by the ideas that I just mentioned, I took stock of my choices. 

In such circumstances, and considering that I had “nothing left to prove” (as Catherine Deneuve herself told me), I could have thought: “what’s the use, why should we even try to survive as a brand, because at any rate, the world is ‘bound for worst’ as Samuel Beckett wrote in a collection of poems. We are ‘worstward ho’ (title of Beckett’s prose poem) and we should stop now. Game over.” 

To be honest, I have to say that I did ask myself this question. I told myself that I had built enough, that my children would have a future at any rate thanks to their talent, and that I could spend my time between my future boat, my home and my “hobbies.” 

Yes, in March, this possibility did run through my mind for a few seconds when I was systematically taking stock of every possible outcome. 

Then, I started thinking about all of these adventures, about all of these stores constructed with a real architectural effort every single time and, especially, about all of the individual people who participated and are still participating in this “reasonable utopia” that is A.P.C. 

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all of the people who participated and worked on building this project, some of whom have been by my side for 33 years now. 

Without others, nothing is possible. 

I realize that I’m not a cynic after all and that only the quest for beauty and sharing it with other sapiens can keep me from the black hole of game over. 
So, I pushed aside the option of giving up. 

And that’s when I simply told myself that the period that is opening up right now is a revolutionary period in which everything can be reinvented. A sort of chance in which I actually feel at home. Social distancing has always been a way of living for me. 

But personally deciding to isolate myself from too many people doesn’t stop me from thinking about the world in general and the positive role that we can play by participating with more harmony, awareness and desire. 

I am extremely proud to have cancelled the A.P.C. show that was supposed to take place on March 2nd to safeguard the health of my teams and guests. I think that I can claim a certain form of morality. 

More than ironic, the musical theme that we were working on was a song called “World Destruction.” This was a pure coincidence, of course. 

So, after rejecting the hypothesis of “refusing to jump,” I started considering that there was a new mission that I and we had to accomplish: ensure the survival of A.P.C. and its esthetic and moral values. 
  
I want to continue to make fashion by creating wearable clothing that allows people to feel like they are themselves and not the puppets of a stylist. 

I want to continue to make sustainable clothing, in terms of both style and quality. 

I want to leave esthetic traces through fashion images whose development and finalization have always belonged to the photographers and stylists who crafted them and not the brand who commissioned them. 

I want to continue to use A.P.C. to initiate artistic projects that recycle our fabrics or old clothing, as I’ve already done with the quilt-making programs and the Butler program, which reintegrates old second-hand jeans in the sales circuit. I’ve been obsessed with not wasting things since I was a kid. 

I want to enrich our customer relationships by having clients participate in an A.P.C. clothing recycling program with charity associations and asking them to join a loyalty program. 

Above all, I’d like to nurture a sense of community. 

When I assess the situation, I think that we’re on the right path and that it is the best one to get through the trying times ahead of us. 

And what could be better adapted to the future than the fashion that we make? Minimalism was almost seen as a flaw, a breakdown. Now, it will be considered as the ultimate virtue in every field of human life. 

I wrote this very personal text because I needed to tell you where A.P.C. came from. 

It’s the first time that I’m allowing myself to be so sincere, at the risk of seeming naïve and “opinionated,” as our American friends say. 

I would like us to move forward together to this destination of mine (“to infinity and beyond,” of course). 

The strength of a small group united by a free mind can be limitless.

"May 7, 2020","Following London, now it's Milan's turn to announce the organisation of a digital fashion week: Milano Digital Fashion Week – July Issue. Set to take place from 14 to 17 July, the event will be dedicated to menswear collections for Spring/Summer 2021 and men's and womenswear pre-collections for Spring 2021, as announced by the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) in a press release. The Milan-based organisation will set up a digital platform, which will be accessible through its website, cameramoda.it, as well as a range of social media channels, including Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Weibo and Youtube. The platform will feature ""photographic and video content, interviews and backstages of creative moments and alternative and unique viewpoints, all organized in a calendar with slots for each brand, the aim being to create a rich and varied palimpsest of use to all operators in the industry,"" explained the Camera della Moda, emphasising that it will aid emerging brands with the creation of digital content as part of its ongoing support programme for young designers.

""The calendar will be further enriched by content such as webinars on themes of special interest to operators in the sector (accreditation required), live streaming of keynotes by important figures in the fashion system, and moments of entertainment/live performances,"" added the organisation. In parallel to Milano Digital Fashion Week's collection presentations, one section of the platform will be dedicated solely to CNMI-accredited showrooms, which will be able to present their brands, as well as their contacts, through photos and videos, the objective being to support Italian businesses through this first post-Covid-19 campaign.

The event acts as a continuation of the ""China, we are with you"" campaign, which allowed more than 25 million Chinese fashion fans who could not travel to Milan this February to watch the Lombard capital's fashion week online. It also answers the various questions that major fashion industry players have been asking themselves since the cancellation of most menswear fashion weeks was announced in early April, along with that of the major June trade fairs.

On April 21, the British Fashion Council was the first national fashion organisation to announce the presentation of both its men's and womenswear runway shows through a single ""genderless"" digital platform. The event's first session is scheduled for June, when designers will be able to present their collections and brand identities under the banner of London Fashion Week. 

Some brands have begun exploring their own, alternative initiatives, including Ermenegildo Zegna, which has revealed that it will present its Spring/Summer 2021 collection via ""an innovative, almost completely digital format"" in July, probably as part of the CNMI's newly announced digital calendar. Saint Laurent, for its part, recently announced that it will be pulling out of Paris Fashion Week in order to follow its own timetable. 

France's Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode had previously announced that it too is in the process of developing a digital event for this June, ""dedicated to image and communication."" On 6 May, the institution revealed that it is also organising ""Paris Fashion Week Online,"" which will present its usual calendar of runway shows via a digital platform. ""Each House will be represented in the form of a creative film/video. Additional content will be included in an editorialized section of the platform. All of this will be widely shared on the main international media networks,"" explained the Fédération. 

And just this once, for this presentation of menswear collections for Spring/Summer 2021, Paris Fashion Week will take place before its Milanese counterpart, from 9 to 13 July. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"May 6, 2020","Tamara Ralph, the designer half of Ralph & Russo, is an Australian couturier based in London, who is currently spending the great European lockdown far from her UK base. Sydney-born Ralph and her three dogs have found refuge in another port city: they are all at her home in Cannes. 
Back in January 2014, Ralph & Russo – birthed by Tamara Ralph and her business partner Michael Russo - became the first British-based couturier to be invited to show on the official Paris haute couture calendar in over a century. Her blend of high glam, rigorous technique and classy proportions mixed with gutsy decoration have won Ralph & Russo a truly global cult status among the super well-heeled.
 
Since their Paris debut, the house has gone from strength to strength, building a global high-end brand based on talent, drive and an enormous amount of hard work.In 2015, they opened their first retail boutique in Harrods – 150 square-meters in the department store’s Superbrands area. That positioned them alongside the likes of Valentino and Christian Dior, as well as Gucci and Prada.
 
Latterly, the company moved into new headquarters in White City, within the hip new development project that also includes the latest Soho House. Their front office is a seven-story townhouse where they meet and greet and fit and dress their clients - Middle Eastern princesses, major league actresses;,international socialites and the girlfriends of London’s Hedgerati. 
In the past decade, Tamara has also managed to dress Gwyneth Paltrow, who donned a one-shoulder pink gown by Ralph & Russo to the 2015 Oscars, Kate Bosworth and Beyoncé, dressed by the brand for her world tour. As for Angelina Jolie, she wore a dove-grey wool-crepe skirt suit when she was made Dame Angelina in Buckingham Palace. Meghan Markle wore Ralph & Russo for her official engagement photos.
 
So, we caught up with Tamara to hear her take on handling Covid-19, managing a brand during the pandemic, sketching for the future and using e-fittings for couture clients.
 
 
FashionNetwork.com: Good morning Tamara, where are you now?
Tamara Ralph: Good day Godfrey, I’m in Cannes. Where, I must say, I have been very impressed by the way France is handle this pandemic. The rules are very strict, only supermarket and pharmacies are open. Most people are in gloves and masks, and the French people respect the rules, which is very good. All my dogs are here. I have three chow-chows and they adore the outdoor space, much better than London. It’s been lovely weather and I even managed to go for a swim at the weekend.
 
But it’s also have been super busy! You have 10 times the amount of e-mails. I have been working about 10 hours a day on average. I like to sketch at night and at the weekends and being able to take time to be creative while being here is really nice.
 
I believe it is a time when companies and brands need to rethink their strategy and how to move forward after this. There’s been a lot of reflection about how things could be make more efficient and more sustainable. Like in terms of travel, which I used to do a lot for work. Obviously, we all realize now that all those trips can been done over a Zoom conference. It’s an eye opener in how things can be improved and that is good thing.
 
FN: When you are in London, where do you work?
TR: We have headquarters in Mayfair, on Park Street, for private clients as well as our couture studio and our archives. As for our head office, it is in White City – one big floor. We'd moved several times, before we were in Victoria, but our atelier kept growing. Now, we have lots of room (30,000 square-feet) for everyone: ready-to-wear, product development, couture atelier and finance and marketing. On average, we have a staff of about 250, but that can grow to 350 during Fashion Week. 
 
FN: Did you have to furlough anyone?
TR: Yes, I am afraid we did. We looked at who could work from home and who could not. So, for those things that couldn't be done at home, we had to look into. 
 
FN: Where is Michael right now?
TR: In Dubai, where he flew to just prior to all the borders closing. He then decided to stay as it was easier since we were reopening our Dubai store. It is in Dubai Mall, which opened last week, the latter being enforced with social distancing measures and the required precautions. Our Monte Carlo store opened yesterday. Even if the border with France is, I think, still closed. But, still, I am not expecting a fast recovery.
 
FN: How are all your team?
TR: We use Zoom and Microsoft teams to work. It’s important to keep everyone motivated and keep the design team inspired. Because everyone needs to think differently. We have lot of calls all day, every day. On the hour – every hour. And, Michael and I are constantly in touch.
 
FN: How has all this pandemic affected your creative ideas?
TR: It’s been very good being in Cannes. I love the energy of this house and I find I am very creative here as it’s very relaxing. Taking a step back from our busy schedule allows me to be more creative. I put aside a couple of hours every day to sketch. And my team ships me fabrics and swatches regularly. Things obviously take longer without a face-to-face. And, although Italy has been on lockdown, they still have been moving and shipping fabrics, and their factories reopened on Monday.
 
FN: You manufacture and lot in in Italy, right?
TR: Right. We produce ready-to-wear, shoes and leather goods. I do travel to Italy about twice a year. Plus, we have people based in Italy and they come to London. But, while I now think that business meetings are just as efficient in video, product meetings are different. You need face-to-face time with the product and factory and designer. That won’t change in the future.
 
FN: Has has this affected you personally?
TR: You rethink your values and what is important. I used to be so busy and Michael too, so taking a step back has been good. Your health becomes a priority and so does family. I always ate healthy, but now I will make more time for myself – for more balance.  A lot of people will come out with different ways of thinking.FN: They say that couture has only 4,000 clients worldwide clients. Judging from Ralph & Russo’s shows in Paris, the brand probably has a quarter of them. How have you been able to fulfill orders to major clients?
TR: We did have a few orders that could not postponed, so we kept a very small skeleton team. Some people worked on those pieces that could be made from home. Couture has such a long lead time, clients are already thinking of their events or weddings next January or February. But, of course, we have had to close as much of the office as possible. So, we adopted new ways of working – we do e-fittings, for our international clientele. Which does save travel for clients and our teams. Our online platform is still working, and we are still shipping ready-to-wear, leather goods and accessories. Plus, we have a few personal shoppers working with different apps: they curate styling options for this period, such as loungewear, and then ship to clients.
 
FN: When do you next expect to show in Paris again?
TR: Obviously, the July couture season is cancelled. So, we are working on our collection and still discussing our direction about a show. We are planning for it, but we take it one day at a time. The next season will probably be different story. A lot of brands will show in their own time, or not at all, or in differing ways. I would not be surprised if the season were cancelled, even if we are still gearing up for it! To me, digital is the most important thing to concentrate on right now. And how that is presented is the way forward.
 
FN: How will fashion change after Covid-19?
TR: I am sketching with hope and happiness and color. People would think that coming out of this nightmare, we would want a ""safer"" option, but I think it is more about feeling good again. I believe that family will be more important. And I expect a stronger focus on loungewear.
 
FN: Do you think that the influence of influencers will wane?
TR: Hmmm. Some have shone through this and some have had a harder time at home. However, I believe that when digital is important, the players in that world will be important. So, I am not sure that will change. As long as digital and social media are important, their representatives will be important.
 
FN: Many people have talked about a reset button – do you think that is the case?
TR: I hope there is a reset button! Why not reset the whole year! I think that people will give up things that they thought were important. And people will take away from this a newfound respect for their own health and time. So, health and wellness will be important; and home too, as product categories.
 
At Ralph & Russo, we do in-house retail design for our stores. I lead that. We also make furniture, which we have all designed. Well, we have started to see a lot of momentum and interest in both from the outside world. So, we want to develop them as a product category, and we are working on that. It will be a very nice synergy for the brand. It will bring us more into the world of design – which we love. It’s all about emotion and texture and color, which I enjoy.
 
FN: You studied fashion in your hometown, Sydney, at Whitehouse, right?
 TR: Yes, it’s like the Central St Martins of Australia. It’s a very good college.
 
FN: Did you graduate?
TR: What do you mean? Of course I graduated, after three years!
 
FN: You’d be surprised how many famous designers didn’t complete their degrees!
TR: Well, I did! I began fashion as a hobby and always loved it. My mum bought me a sewing machine and grandmother donated a tailored mannequin for me. They were in fashion. My mum was in interior design after having worked in fashion. We had several generations in fashion and mum had a small atelier in a room in our home to create. My grandmother was a couturier and was very particular about quality and finish, so I learned the technical side from her. I always sketched. All the time. When I was about 12, I stitched my first pieces, and when I was 15, I sold my first design to a friend: this then grew into becoming my life.
 
All the construction technique I got from my grandmother meant that when I opened up our fashion house in London, I personally trained the first staff we hired and they now run my entire atelier.
 
Where and when do you plan to open more boutiques?
TR: We want to open flagships in key positions in the world. We have a New York store currently on hold. It was meant to open in May, on Madison, but now it will have to be later this year. We opened our first store in Harrods, and have shops in Monte Carlo, Doha and Dubai, alongside other shop-in-shops elsewhere. In Paris, we have a ""maison"" on rue François Premier, and want to have a flagship too. Plus, we are looking into Asia.
 
FN: Where do you hope to be in five years?
TR: In lots of interesting directions! Just as we wanted, we plan to build the brand, even if things have already grown very fast. From the beginning, we always wanted all-encompassing categories – from beauty to home. So in September and November, we plan to launch two important brand collaborations, as long as they are not delayed. Though I cannot say more just yet.

"May 5, 2020","Artists in Lithuania invited residents of the capital Vilnius to a ""Mask Fashion Week"" on Tuesday, encouraging them to have fun wearing the now-mandatory facial accessory.Spearheading the initiative, designer Julia Janus said she hoped it would ""encourage creativity"" as well as compliance with orders to wear masks in public to help stem coronavirus infections.

""This is the first Mask Fashion Week in the world,"" Janus told reporters after a symbolic ribbon-cutting ceremony to launch the event.""I hope that it will also be the last, but who knows.""

More than 20 billboards dotted around the city feature posters of artists wearing their own uniquely styled masks. Each is captioned ""Creativity Cannot be Masked"".

Painted with pursed red lips or toothy grins, some masks are intended to draw laughs while others aim to impress with elegant embroidery, pearls and lace or tailored finishes that match a business suit.

Featuring pointy black beaks, others are modelled on masks worn by doctors during the Black Death that ravaged Europe in the mid-1300s.

Lithuania has begun a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, reopening open-air cafes and restaurants along with shops and libraries as infections slow.

Vilnius mayor Remigijus Simasius has offered cafes free use of public spaces, saying he wants the capital to become ""one giant outdoor cafe"".

Although cinemas remain closed, hundreds of movie fans are flocking to Lithuania's main international airport to a drive-in cinema created in the shadow of planes grounded by the coronavirus pandemic.

The health ministry confirmed 1,423 cases of the novel coronavirus, including 48 deaths as of Tuesday in Lithuania, a nation of 2.8 million people.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

The two London-based designers joined Instagram artist Sara Shakeel in creating original sketches for the cover of the latest issue, which went on sale today. It celebrates British fashion and explores how the pandemic is altering the way fashion houses and consumers perceive luxury.
 
All covers will be sold in an effort to fight Covid-19. Erdem’s sketches will be auctioned off to benefit the Emergency Designer Network and Richard Quinn’s will be auctioned off to benefit #VisorArmy, a group of designers and milliners making PPE for frontline healthcare workers.Erdem Moralioglu, of Canadian-Turkish origin, is one of the most celebrated designers in contemporary Britain; while Quinn is the rising star of the London season, who leapt to prominence in February 2018 when he was presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design by the Queen herself.
 
The actual issue itself contains exclusive interviews with Caroline Rush, chief exec of the British Fashion Council, and Livia Firth, co-founder and creative director of Eco-Age.  For their covers, Quinn emphasized his dazzling floral aesthetic, while Erdem drew a marvelous full fantasy flower-patterned sketch of a ball-gown. 
 
“We are delighted designers Erdem and Richard Quinn have created illustrations around the theme of nature for this special issue of Grazia – and that we are auctioning the original sketches to raise money for two relief funds providing essential PPE equipment for frontline workers. The Covid-19 outbreak has evidently been challenging for the industry, but it’s amazing to see what brands and creatives have done and how they’ve all come together to fight back,” said Hattie Brett, Grazia Editor in a release.
 
Her March 31 issue of Grazia also addressed the pandemic and featured four NHS frontline workers on its cover.

"May 1, 2020","Last June, as part of the Pitti Uomo trade show, Carine Roitfeld staged the biggest fashion show of the year - more than 3,500 guests strutted onto a podium installed on top of a Florentine hill, bathed in the golden glow of twilight: the image was memorable. This Friday, at 10 p.m., the stylist, editor  and ultimate French fashion icon will organize an event that will be both  more accessible and at the same time more intimate: a fashion show of confined models, to be broadcast on YouTube.By organizing this event, Carine Roitfeld is supporting amfAR, a foundation whose fight is against AIDS. Every year, the former Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Paris stages huge fashion shows to enliven the organization's celebrated galas, at the Hôtel du Cap in Antibes, which always wrap up the Cannes Film Festival in style at the end of May. This year, the fashion show will be a means to raise funds to support the fight against the Coved-19 pandemic. Many celebrities have responded to Carine Roitfeld's call: Kim Kardashian-West, Simon Porte Jacquemus, Hailey Bieber, Adriana Lima, Diane von Fürstenberg, Halima Aden, Virgil Abloh, Alexander Wang, Winnie Harlow, Irina Shayk, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Heron Preston, Miss Fame and many more. These fashion celebrities have volunteered to participate in the event, and will be making donations to the American foundation.

Few stylists have had such an influence nor have had such an aesthetic impact on fashion’s global image than Roitfeld. Nearly a decade after leaving her job as at Vogue Paris, where she invented the concept of porno chic – an intertwinement of both suave elegance and risqué references  – she now boasts 1.7 million followers on Instagram. Or three times more than Emmanuelle Alt, who succeeded her at the head of the publication. Once Karl Lagerfeld’s signature stylist, Roitfeld is now global fashion director of Harper's Bazaar and founder of her own publication, CR Fashion book, which is a reference within the industry. The stylist also regularly is a consultant to leading luxury brands. With this in mind, we asked this quintessential Parisienne a few questions to find out more about the event she is preparing for Friday, and to discuss her point of view - always iconoclastic - on the current situation.FashionNetwork.com: Where are you now? Are you with friends or family? 

Carine Roitfeld: I'm alone at home in Paris.

FNW: Why create this new kind of fashion show?

CR: I love to organize this type of event. After ten annual fashion shows for amfAR, and a first “CR Runway” show in Florence last year, Vladimir, my son and business partner, made me an interesting proposal: to combine the strengths of these two events to create the very first virtual fashion show – at home. The fashion industry is always game when it comes to supporting a good cause, and it's all to its credit. Besides, in our industry, the ""trend"" is towards collaboration. Nevertheless, this is a charity event. And this year, all of the funds raised by amfAR will be donated to help in research against Covid-19.

FNW: How is such a fashion show organized? By doing fittings via Zoom? 

CR: No, we did not do a video conference fitting. All of the models will walk from home, with whatever they may have found in their wardrobes, following the advice of our team of hairdressers, make-up artists and manicure specialists... For once, it’s not me who will choose what they wear! Given the current situation, we haven’t asked for any product from either designers nor brands, but some will nonetheless participate in the event; it’s important to have their support, even from a distance.

FNW: Does this fashion show have a specific theme? 

CR: Freedom!

FNW: Where will you be when the show is broadcast? 

CR: At home, of course!

FNW: How has the pandemic affected your creative ideas? 

CR: It didn't affect them. On the contrary, the time I’ve spent alone, thinking, allows me to be even more creative.

FNW: When did you realize how serious the situation was? 

CR: During the last days of Milan Fashion Week, we felt that the pandemic was about to overwhelm Europe. The Paris shows took place anyway, and fashion houses distributed masks to guests... And just a few days after Paris Fashion Week ended, we entered this period of confinement.

FNW: Do you think there will be a Fashion Week next September? 

CR: Some brands have already canceled their fashion shows, and I imagine that others will organize events in intimate or very small groups. In my opinion, we will have to adapt to a newfound reality.

FNW: For your part, will you be going to Fashion Weeks in London, Milan, New York and Paris?

CR: I've always loved going to fashion shows - everything will depend on whether or not we will have the right to travel, as well as the directives of our respective governments. It will not be a season like any other. In some countries, airports may still even be closed.

FNW: In your opinion, what trend will emerge from next September’s fashion shows?

CR: I think that designers are in the same state as I am currently: they have done a lot of thinking during this pandemic, and will propose a post-Coronavirus type of fashion, which will be thought out differently.

FNW: Will the world change after this health crisis? 

CR: What I do know is that there will be a post-Coronavirus era in fashion, but it is still impossible to comment on that as of today.

FNW: Will magazines recover from the crisis we are currently experiencing? 

CR: I think that after all these months spent on their screens, many of our readers will want to leaf through a magazine.

FNW: The confinement was a means to remind one of family in the eyes of the public. And for you, who works closely with your son Vladimir? 

CR: We have been working together for four years now. Paradoxically, being apart has brought us even closer. I hope that this imposed distance will only be temporary, as it is difficult not to be able to see your own family during months at a time. But we are fortunate to all be in good health. Be cautious, stay at home, and enjoy this show, which I hope will be able to change your mind a bit! And, once again, a big thank you to the models, who played their part, as well as to my lifelong teams - Piergiorgio Del Moro (casting), Tom Pecheux (makeup), Sam McKnight (hairdresser), Mei Kawajiri (manicure), Michel Gaubert (sound designer) and Stephen Galloway, who acted as a fabulous “runway coach”. I can't begin to conceive fashion without this team effort!

"Apr 30, 2020","Carmen March, the Spanish designer noted for her Latin glamour style, is to close down her fashion house at the end of next month.

The Mallorcan-born designer announced the news on Thursday, saying she would end her eponymous label on May 30th, when “the brand will shut down all activities.”
 “I would like to thank all the individuals and institutions that have supported me, not only on this last project, but throughout my career in fashion. I feel blessed for having been able to work and learn so much from an amazing team of extraordinary people. These years have shaped me as a person, and have been the ultimate adventure,” the designer said in a terse release.
 
For the last several years, March had shown her collections by appointment in Paris, winning fans for her high-octane style. Presenting in a Paris boutique hotel suite last September, March unveiled a Latin New Wave collection that combined the edge of posh punk with Spanish flamenco dash. As for this coming fall, March referenced – the first movie star to ever appear naked in film – with Shetland wool bustiers and the designer’s signature bolero, this time in bold polkadot.Relaunched in 2016, Carmen March’s collections celebrated the ""beauty and sophistication of a modern woman,"" the house noted in its communiqué.
 
March certainly created a distinctive oeuvre. However, with the industry in convulsions due to the global pandemic, her house will not be the only inventive brand forced to shutter in the current crisis.
 
“Structured bustier tops, ruffles or classic high-waisted pants had become signature pieces for the Mallorca-born designer, gaining the attention of international fashion press, retailers, celebrities and influencers. Respect for excellence, contemporary femininity, new tailoring techniques, lightness and a legacy that is intrinsically Spanish were the core elements of Carmen’s creative proposal. Carmen would like to thank all of her supporters during these amazing years,” the release concluded.

"Apr 29, 2020","The latest instalment of the quarterly Lyst Index is also one that comes in the middle of the biggest crisis to hit fashion in decades. And the luxury search giant said the impact of Covid-19 was felt throughout the quarter in key Asian markets, and most keenly in the US and Europe towards the final month.But trends continued. So what were the headline stories? Well, Off-White held on as the “hottest brand in the world” for the third successive quarter. “At a time when consumers around the world have found themselves confined to their homes, seeking connections online, Off-White’s loyal and highly-engaged social following has proven invaluable,” Lyst said.

And in a clear reflection of the pandemic, demand for fashion face masks saw a 496% surge in searches in the quarter, with Off-White’s arrow mask taking the first spot in the hottest men’s product list. As consumers seek home fitness solutions and comfortable clothing to wear indoors, Nike was among the fastest risers this quarter, climbing nine places into third position, edging Gucci into fourth place and out of the top three for the first time since the index began. 

It saw huge demand for products such as hoodies, sweatpants and shorts and its Kobe 4 Protro Carpe Diem sneakers, entered the men’s hottest products list in fourth place. In fact page views for sneakers from the long-term collab spiked 733% after the athlete died in February. 

Meanwhile, Prada continued its comeback and rose two places in the hottest brands ranking to reach fifth place. The news that Raf Simons was joining the team generated a 911% spike in social mentions for the brand. And it also helped his namesake label re-enter the hottest brands list, rising 12 places to 17th.Another in-demand brand, Jacquemus, also entered the 20 hottest brands ranking for the first time, climbing seven places to reach 15th. The AW20 show that was peppered with supermodels had helped to boost its social media mentions by over 1,100%. 

Other hottest brands newcomers included Thom Browne and Rick Owens, which rose 14 and 8 positions respectively.

HOT PRODUCTS

Product-wise, Bottega Veneta’s padded Cassette bag was the number one women’s product and Off-White’s soft lace bodysuit was number two.

Also noteworthy, Telfar’s embossed logo tote bag was the third hottest women’s product and propelled the brand onto the list for the first time with an average 30,000 searches a month and plenty of celebrity sightings. Overall, searches for Telfar were up 29% in Europe. 

Gucci’s GG patterned tights were fourth and the loungewear trend made an impact with Anine Bing’s tiger sweatshirt the fifth hottest women’s product of the quarter. Page views of the top spiked 418% in the week following the release of Netflix’s Tiger King series, while searches for the brand rose 19% this quarter. 

Comfort and home fitness also meant the Adidas x Beyoncé Ivy Park super sleek 72 sneakers were sixth. And page views for New Balance sneakers rose 41% quarter-on-quarter while the brand’s 993 running shoes entered the women’s hottest products list for the first time in seventh place. Nike’s Air fleece joggers were number eight.

Ganni was ninth with a simple cotton shirt and the resale trend also made its presence felt with pre-owned version’s of Chanel’s classic double flap bag seeing a 75% increase in searches to close the hottest women’s products list in 10th place. This was perhaps driven by the fact that Chanel doesn’t sell bags on its own website, and with its stores hut, resale was the only option.

For men, as mentioned, Off-White’s mask was top, followed by Loewe’s half-zip fleece from the Eye/Loewe/Nature outdoors collection in second place as searches rose 88% and the label itself rose two places in the hottest brands ranking. 

Gucci x Disney’s hooded sweatshirt was third with the Nike sneakers mentioned earlier fourth. 

The Comme des Garçons Play x Converse Chuck 70 high sneakers were fifth, ahead of Stone Island cargo trousers. Prada’s bolo tie was the seventh most in-demand product in the hottest men’s products list and Asics’ gel-pulse 10 sneakers took eighth place. Demand for the running shoes first spiked in January, and picked up again in March, increasing 64% during the quarter overall. Meanwhile page views for Asics increased 25% over the period.

And the Versace I Love Baroque bathrobe was ninth while Thom Browne’s 4-bar jersey sweatshirt concluded the list in 10th spot.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 28, 2020","On Tuesday, April 28, the sustainable sneaker brand Allbirds is launching its first eco-friendly high performance running shoes, made from renewable materials with a reduced impact on the environment. The new Tree Dashers are available in four colors from Allbirds.com.Respect for nature is a major preoccupation for San Francisco-based brand Allbirds. Following on from everyday sneakers, slip-ons, boat shoes, flats, and weather repellent shoes, which have all been developed from eco-friendly materials, the brand has now extended its offering to include Tree Dasher high-performance running shoes.

Tested over thousands of kilometers by some 50 athletes, the shoes stand out not only for their environmentally friendly materials and production process, but also for their performance-based properties: breathability, cooling, cushioning, stabilization, comfort, and durability.As to the details, Tree Dashers are made with uppers in Tencel Lyocell, an environmentally friendly material renowned for its breathability and durability, anti-microbial merino wool lining, midsoles in SweetFoam, a material derived from sugar cane, and insoles in a foam made from castor bean oil. All of these innovative green solutions have enabled the brand to considerably reduce the shoes' carbon footprint.

On the issue of emissions, Allbirds has announced that it will soon be labeling all of its shoes to clearly display their carbon footprint. This initiative has already begun with the ""Dasher,"" which is provided with a carbon footprint label that takes into account measurements for raw materials, manufacturing and the shoes' end of life. Having added together figures for all of these, the brand estimates that each pair of the new running shoes  will have a carbon footprint of nine kilograms.

For the launch, Tree Dashers, which are priced at US$125, are available in four limited edition shades -- Cyclone, Flame, Geyser and Thunder. The shoes can be obtained from Allbirds' stores and the brand's online shop.

"Apr 28, 2020","ANDAM, the historic French award for emerging talent, has announced a different format for 2020 due to Covid-19. And the new focus will be very definitely French.
 
Ever since its debut in 1989, when its first winner was the then largely obscure Martin Margiela, ANDAM has garnered a reputation for discovering great future stars. However, in the wake of Covid-19, ANDAM will exceptionally reformat its 2020 edition and redirect the prize money to four diverse designers and creators, who must all be based in France. 
 As finalists traditionally must present their ideas and collections to the distinguished jury in person, social distancing effectively made any classical competition impossible this year.
 
“Powerful catalyst of the present time, ANDAM needs to be also a strong platform that will help us anticipate and solve the major stakes raised by this crisis. We have to support and spread all the innovations that could facilitate the emergence of new forms of expressions. Now is the time to reinvent our industry: with the creative talents, the most innovative fashion startups, the brands focusing on the common good which will make us proud. I am convinced that Paris is the best place for this challenge,” said Guillaume Houzé, ANDAM President and board member of the Galeries Lafayette.ANDAM’s change of direction comes two weeks after the LVMH Prize announced there would be no final this year, and instead decided to spread its prize money into lots of €40,000 to be attributed to its eight finalists.
 
At ANDAM, the total prize money of €500,000 will be spread between four designers in the following manner: a total of €350,000 will be given to two previous ANDAM finalists or winners, provided they be French companies and own the majority of their brands. One endowment of €200,000 will go to support an established structure generating more than €10 million annual turnover; whereas a second will go to a company with revenues of between one and ten million euros.
 
Thirdly, the Pierre Bergé Prize of €100,000 will be awarded to “a young French company that offers an innovative creative vision and/or business model.” The company must also be French, independent and have at least one commercial season, as well as annual sales of €1 million as of 2019. 
Finally, there will be an Innovation Prize of €50,000 to be given to an entrepreneur or start-up, either French or international, to develop a project in France offering innovative or technological solutions in the extended fields of fashion and design. 
 
“By seeking the new business models and innovative technologies, ANDAM commits itself and mobilizes itself to support the initiatives absolutely necessary to the mutation of our industry. I am very grateful and would like to thank the French ministry of Culture, DÉFI, and all our sponsors, which all accepted to maintain their contribution this year to offer a committed and vital support to the talents who will ensure the reinvention and continuity of the fashion industry,” stressed Nathalie Dufour, Founder and Executive Director of ANDAM.
 
Candidates can apply now online on www.andam.fr up until June 8, 2020, while the jury will be held virtually on July 2 as to select the four winners, determined by a vote of absolute majority.
 
The 2020 jury is composed of 18 noted fashion executives and includes Riccardo Bellini of Chloé; Xavier Clergerie of Who’s Next; Guillaume de Seynes of Hermès; Bruno Pavlovsky of Chanel; François-Henri Pinault of Kering; Clarisse Reille of DEFI; Renzo Rosso of Diesel; Nadja Swarovski; and Sidney Toledano of LVMH.

"Apr 27, 2020","As the world combats the spread of the novel coronavirus, two Bahraini entrepeneurs are adding a little colour to an item that is now almost part of everyday life -- masks.Noor Khamdan and Nada Alawi want to raise awareness and add enthusiasm to wearing masks in the small Gulf country. 

Khamdan's designs include symbols from Gulf culture, ranging from the traditional ghutra (headdress) or the Bahraini flag to the local viral hashtag #Team_Bahrain. ""The mask you are wearing is to protect you and others against COVID-19 and to also bring colour and joy into your life in these hard times,"" Khamdan, founder of BH Masks, told AFP.

""By giving people the option to invest in colourful, washable masks, we are ensuring medical masks are saved for those who need it the most, such as medical staff,"" said the mother of three whose masks cost around $3. 

Like many other Gulf countries, Bahrain has made it mandatory to wear masks outside the home, having eased some restrictions at the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. 

It has so far recorded more than 2,700 infections, including eight deaths. 

Alawi, co-founder of the lifestyle brand Annada, repurposes uniquely-designed scarves into masks, saying she wants to cater for people who want ""something different"".

""Some people want to wear something that gives them a bit of happiness, a bit of inspiration,"" she told AFP.

""With masks being mandatory... you can't tell someone's feelings, you can't tell if they're smiling at you.""

""At least, this is a way to tell someone's personality when they have colour on their face.""

Annada's masks, which come in a set of three, are giftwrapped in a teal box with a ribbon and cost about $52.

Twenty-five percent of the proceeds go to  charity.

""Even at times like this, you want to get a surprise and to feel like you're getting beauty,"" said Alawi.

"Apr 27, 2020","The house of Saint Laurent announced Monday morning that it will quit the official Paris runway season in September in a shock decision, and revealed that it is planning its own schedule – at least for 2020. 
“Conscious of the current circumstance and its waves of radical change, Saint Laurent has decided to take control of its pace and reshape its schedule,” the house said in a surprise statement.
 
Its sudden move comes one month after the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM), French fashion’s governing body, cancelled the Paris menswear season, scheduled for June, in the wake of Covid-19. The FHCM also announced that the next Paris womenswear catwalk season, due to begin in late September, would instead be a co-ed season.For the past several seasons, ever since designer Anthony Vaccarello joined Saint Laurent in 2016, the house has staged giant and lengthy co-ed shows runway shows on huge stages on the opposite bank side of the Seine from the Eiffel Tower, menswear often taking up the second half of each show. 
“Now more than ever, the brand will lead its own rhythm, legitimating the value of time and connecting with people globally by getting closer to them in their own space and lives,” added Saint Laurent, one of the key luxury fashion houses controlled by Kering, the world’s second-largest luxury group.
 
“With this strategy firmly in place, Saint Laurent will not present its collections in any of the pre-set schedules of 2020. Saint Laurent will take ownership of its calendar and launch its collections following a plan conceived with an up-to-date perspective, driven by creativity,” it added. However, the brand didn't indicate what it might be planning in terms of timing or location of its next runway event.
 
This decision is doubly shocking in view of the fact that Saint Laurent’s CEO, Italian-born Francesca Bellettini, is also the president of the FHCM’s womenswear division. Hence the fact that by cancelling its Paris season, Saint Laurent isn't exactly instilling a vote of confidence in the future for the French capital. It also presents a real risk of a chain reaction, as other top brands will also “take ownership” of their own calendars and decide not to stage runway shows this fall in the French capital. Given the lavish nature of the Saint Laurent show, this decision will also be seen as a significant cost-cutting move.  
Saint Laurent has been skipping the official Paris menswear season for several years now. Back in June 2019, Saint Laurent decamped to Los Angeles with its summer 2020 collection, staging a show on Malibu Beach, before the likes of Keanu Reeves and Miley Cyrus. A collection inspired by Yves Saint Laurent’s halcyon days in Marrakech, reimagined for 21st century Los Angeles. A year earlier, Belgium-born Vaccarello showed its menswear collection in New York.
 
France has been in lockdown since Tuesday, March 17, a period that President Emmanuel Macron later extended to Monday, May 11. After that date, France currently plans to gradually ease restrictions. Schools are due to reopen, but restaurants, cafés, hotels, cinemas and other leisure activities will remain closed.
 
The FHCM could not be reached for comment, though Bellettini is understood to have informed the organization ahead of today’s announcement.
 
The FHCM, which controls the haute couture, womenswear and menswear seasons in Paris, the pre-eminent catwalk city of the world, has already indicated that it will shortly make an announcement about a new form of digital presentations in the future in Paris.

"Apr 24, 2020","Few countries are going through as much a crisis as Lebanon right now, even if the country has been relatively unscathed by the Covid-19 in comparison to Western Europe. 

FashionNetwork.com caught up with the country’s most famous designer, the Phoenician couturier Elie Saab, to discuss the impact of the pandemic. And how his couture house is handling the enormous disruption caused by Covid-19.  
Though he always shows haute couture and ready-to-wear in Paris, Saab’s hometown is Beirut, which has been the center of enormous political activity this spring. This week, Lebanon’s lawmakers donned face masks to meet inside a cavernous Beirut theatre – in order to observe social distancing – the place sprayed with disinfectant as they entered. Outside, anti-government protestors paraded around in hundreds of cars - again, to maintain social distancing.
 
Remarkably, throughout Lebanon’s long years of civil war and often chaotic conflict, Saab and his three sons have managed to build one of fashion’s most distinctive houses, develop a unique aesthetic and dress an Oscar winner. So, we caught up with Saab for his particular take on the current crisis, and what we can all potentially learn from this dark moment in world history. As well as how he sees the before and after Covid-19, both very different to him. And why, to Saab, this period can be one of personal fulfillment; and an opportunity to organize one’s thoughts; reduce anger and tame ego. 
 
FashionNetwork.com: Where are you now? With your family?
Elie Saab: I'm in Lebanon with my wife Claudine. We spend our time between the house in Beirut and our house in the mountains in Faqra. Elie Jr and Celio are also in Lebanon but Michel is still in Switzerland. 
 
FN: How is the situation in the Lebanon?
ES: Unfortunately, the situation in Lebanon is not very favorable. For a while now, we have been living in a fairly fragile and agitated economic and social context and this virus has made the situation even worse.
 
 
FN: How are all your team?
ES: Everyone is fine. We had taken the necessary measures to ensure the safety of our teams.
However, we are starting to set our goals by looking to the future, considering that this pandemic has become more contained and controlled.
The teams are working on a suitable tactic and a more suitable strategy for the long term that will be applied immediately.
 
 
FN: How has all this pandemic affected your creative ideas? 
ES: Honestly, I consider that this pause has generated certain positive consequences. I had never had the time or the opportune occasion to put my ideas in order, to reflect amply, to see things from another angle and in a more serene way. This confinement is an important period of reflection and contemplation. I continue to feed my creativity on a daily basis, I let myself be inspired by everything around me.
 
FN: When was the moment when you first realized how serious this all was?
ES: We were living in an express world where everyone was caught up with their agenda between incessant travel and consecutive events. Now, suddenly, the whole planet is in confinement, the world economy is affected, so we understand that the situation is out of the ordinary. Nature, whether one likes it or not, is stronger than we humans. What we have just experienced will not be able to reproduce easily. It may be tens of generations more before we face a similar test that will change our perception, be it personal or professional. I hope that everyone will take advantage of this situation to build a better, healthier, more balanced, simpler, and above all more humane future. 
 
FN: Has anyone you know personally been affected?
ES: This virus has unfortunately affected a large number of people around the world. To see that there is a large number of deaths really pains me ...
Like everyone else, I know friends who have been mildly affected by the virus or their family members. But I believe education and awareness about the virus now will help contain the spread so that we can get by as quickly and as best as possible. 
 
FN: How will fashion change after Covid-19?
ES: Fashion as well as the world will no longer be the same. We will refer to before and after Covid-19. Many things will change. I was convinced that a change would take place sooner or later because the cycle was no longer human. But I never thought that in our time, a pandemic would mobilize the planet to this point. The pace in our industry had become insane, robotic: we were working on several collections at the same time, so we lost the pleasure of savoring each one. We were under continuous pressure, we lost the joy of living and enjoying human relationships, as well as listening to others. Due to the speed and the sequence that we lived, simplicity lost its value, merits had become less and less appreciated. The calendar we were following was crazy and barely gave us time to catch our breath. Even the customers were bombarded by the novelties on the market. The consumption of the products became irrational and it was rather an endless race. We have to start again on the basis of favoring quality over quantity, creating brand-specific experiences, giving back the product's own value so that it remains timeless. I really believe that today, we are moving to a new chapter that will give us the chance to set the record straight. 
FN: How will the world change after Covid-19?
ES: Our daily life will also change. We got into the habit of connecting remotely, working remotely, finding opportunities and looking for reliable solutions. We have developed our adaptability. We have realized that we can do things without being on-site by ensuring good remote management. Everything can be done online and this gives greater importance to technology. This phase remains very exceptional, as everything will gradually resume to regain its place – as it should. Excess remains the boredom of mankind and everything must be well-balanced to give a better meaning to humanity. Earth, too, had to breathe differently, with less pollution! It was really a click that brought us back to true and simple values. I am optimistic, I welcome this situation positively as a way to redefine our aspirations, our needs, our expectations. This period gave me a certain feeling of gratitude. I consider it as an experience of personal fulfillment to assess the details that surround us. I really hope that many people have had the chance to organize their thoughts during this time to reduce their anger and tame their ego. Some had lost their bearings before, and now is the time to raise the bar and return to simplicity and authenticity. 
 
FN: As an industry of incessant travel, where the shows went on last month even as the pandemic raged in China, does fashion bear any of the blame?
FN: Fashion Week may have accelerated the spread of the virus, but there were also other sporting events, conferences, etc. taking place around the world. Meetings and trips are not just for visiting fashion capitals and attending fashion shows. The spread of this virus has no borders or barriers. I especially do not want to associate this virus with the Fashion Month period because fashion represents beauty and elegance, Fashion Week evokes conviviality, and I insist that it symbolizes such, and that, forever. 
 
FN: Many people have talked about a reset button – do you think that is the case?
ES: Of course, the entire planet is on hiatus and it takes a ""reset button"" to restart it. Yet, you must be very careful when restarting the machine. We must ensure that we will take over the reins with skill, by emphasizing quality, in all of these aspects. We cannot ignore this phase that we have lived and re-launch lightly as if nothing had happened. This initialization button should trigger a promising start. I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm in the midst of organizing myself to pass this course at best.
 
FN: Others have noted that influencers have gone very quiet. Do you think that their influence will wane?
ES: I have a belief that you cannot cross out something that has existed for a certain period of time. Influencers marked their territory: some were influential and were able to create an identity, others lesser so, and this will also be the case in the future. These influencers are above all a source of inspiration for the millennia and I hope that they will evolve in the right direction.
 
FN: What will we keep from this period and what will we discard?
ES: Personally, I will keep my character that you know well: simple, human, courteous and insightful, so as to not complicate matters. I will get rid of everything that could harm the quality of life that I will begin again, and take more pleasure around human relationships. My initial intuition had never deceived me, and today, I am even more convinced that you have to be well-surrounded to give more to the world.
I have always gone forward with hope, and learned to overcome obstacles by determining the essentials, what inspires me – and this will further strengthen my conviction.
 
FN: Do you still expect to come to Paris and shows in September?
ES: Paris is my second city, and I can't wait to come back to start again fully. I hope that this industry will recover in the best conditions possible, and that we will all be united to create subtly.

"Apr 24, 2020","This summer’s Milan menswear season may have been cancelled due to the pandemic, but Ermenegildo Zegna is still planning a show – though with a radically new digital format show.
 
The house’s creative director Alessandro Sartori confirmed to FashionNetwork.com that Zegna will stage its Ermenegildo Zegna XXX Summer 2021 collection in the opening half of July; and promises what he calls a “phygital experience”, or a meeting of a like-show and digital technology.
 “It will almost be a digital movie. A blend of live performance with a pre-recorded environment. Using CGI technology where you really layer frames one over the other. There will be live models wearing the collection. But instead of just the normal runway, with just me in an empty space with the models, we are working towards a live experience in a really special environment,” explained the designer.
 
Ermenegildo Zegna XXX is the Italian menswear house’s top couture collection, which in recent years has opened the Italian men’s runway season on Friday nights with mammoth shows.""There’s a time for everything. This is the time to think differently about the next future"", says Gildo Zegna, CEO of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group. 
 
Sartori has built elongated catwalks everywhere from the top of the lake outside Oscar Niemeyer’s legendary wave-like 1975 headquarters (for publisher Mondadori) at Segrate, to a gigantic disused steel mill north of Milan. Always with a grand evening show, which opens the entire Milan season. Though this July event will almost certainly be early afternoon, so it can reach a global audience in Asia, Europe and North America.
 
“I love evening shows, but live at night does not work for our Asian followers. With this format we can enter into people’s room and have a unique experience – so early afternoon makes a point of contact from east to west,” explained the designer.
 
He is planning about 45 to 50 looks – as is his habit – and suspects future shows will become a blend of digital and physical as well. After all, the designer is known as an innovator in show production. For instance, a decade ago, Zegna used early CGI technology to stage a show in its headquarters, with giant imagery of the Bund in Shanghai, which made it look as if a cast of Asian models were walking in China.
 
“When we understood the situation was different because of the pandemic, we debriefed about how we wanted to express the collection to how tell its story. Instead of a normal show and then building the digital proposition after, we decided to work together from the beginning with our digital team,” added Sartori, noting this was an anniversary year for the brand.
 
Zegna, which this year celebrates its 110 years of history, has been been active in the fight against Covid-19. The group made donations to the Civil Protection in Italy, totaling 3 million Euros, to support nurses, doctors, scientists and volunteers across Italy who have been working tirelessly to fight this epidemic. 
 
Moreover, Zegna has also been actively developing its own virtual showroom. And working on new virtual concepts for made to measure, where a client sees himself projected in 3D. “We needed a different approach. Right now, it’s impossible to know for certain what percentage of buyers will be travelling. So, we have to develop a new idea of selling collections with digital tools; with 3D pictures and order format. Giving them the possibility to place orders even if they don’t travel.”
 
As noted, the Camera della Moda, Italian fashion’s governing body, called off the Italian menswear season, originally scheduled for June 19 to 23 in Milan. And announced plans to amalgamate menswear and women’s fashion into a co-ed season in September. The British Fashion Council, on the other hand, maintained its June 12 season dates with a new format for London Fashion Week, adding women’s and menswear together in an experimental digital season. 
Sartori applauded London Fashion Week's decision, but cautioned that he regarded its dates as far too early.
 
“I think London’s ideas are brave. It’s very interesting to take this decision and go into a different format. But it’s a little too early, especially to order fabric, do production and style everything.  June, in my view, is too early. So that’s why we moved back one month later. While September is not a realistic time for us. It’s far too late to take orders then,” he argued.
 
After sanitizing its workspaces and respecting new Italian regulations, Zegna plans to open its workshops and plants on May 4. After that, hopefully, everything will return to a normal production process. Zegna produces apparel in Novara, outerwear near Milan, shoes and leather in Parma and uses resources from Switzerland all the way to Naples.
 
For the past month and a half, Sartori has been working from his apartment in South Milan. 
 
“Yes, today is day 46 of working from home. I can no longer walk in my apartment between all the clothes and samples and shoes; and in between screens for so many Skypes and Zooms and online fittings. But at least it meant a quiet moment design,” he chuckles.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 22, 2020","Fashion and luxury brands worldwide have launched a wide ranging array of sustainable initiatives, timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary. The international day dedicated to environmental reform celebrated its half century on Wednesday, April 22.
 
From carbon-neutral measures by Versace in Milan and an eco-warrior video poem commissioned by Vivienne Westwood in London; to Banana Republic in the United States introducing new vintage recycling ideas and fresh approaches by Australian swimwear line Horizon Athletic taking place all the way Down Under, fashion houses near and wide are all affirming their support for the ecological movement, doubling their efforts as the current pandemic reinforces fears in the worldwide community of humankind’s mistreatment of our planet.  
In London, Stella McCartney – the designer forerunner in sustainability and environmentally sensible fashion – took over Piccadilly Circus with a giant billboard.  “For us, Every Day is Earth Day,” read the signage, with a video featuring supermodel Amber Valletta, daubed in blue camouflage paint.
 
“Certainly, the situation is sad, but there is hope. The ideas of community and compassion struggle against the pandemic, but also work to save the Earth. Nature has given us a second chance, to correct our collective impact, to learn from it and to act. There are fewer cars on the road; fewer planes in the sky; industry is immobile. Carbon emissions levels around the world could see their sharpest decrease since the 1940s. We are already seeing a 58% reduction in daily carbon emissions in the European Union, as well as a 70% reduction in road traffic in the United Kingdom and a 40% reduction in nitrogen dioxide in London,” the designer said in a release.Capri Holdings, the owners of Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, released its first group-wide corporate social responsibility strategy, timed to coincide with Earth Day's half-century long existence.
 
The group has set itself a 100% carbon-neutral goal for direct operations, and plans to source all of its energy from renewable sources by the end of 2025. Additionally, it set other goals for 2025: all plastic packaging must become fully recyclable, compostable or reusable; sourcing will be at least 95% of all leather from certified tanneries; and it will add traceability to its supply chain.
 
“We recognize that as our company grows, so do our responsibilities, and welcome the opportunity to do more. We believe that sound environmental and social policies are both ethically correct and fiscally responsible,” said CEO John D. Idol. 
 
British fashion legend Vivienne Westwood’s house released a video in partnership with Canopy, a non-profit group dedicated to protecting forests and wildlife, that features Kai-Isaiah Jamal & Aidan Zamiri.
 
“Sometimes I put on a plain black T-Shirt, a mixed-blend over my head and forget that in this basic T lay the substances of ancient forests that no longer exist,” laments the poet-activist.
 
From its beginnings in California, Earth Day is now observed by 192 countries worldwide, making it the largest secular holiday in the worldwide.
 
Banana Republic, historically a marque founded on selling upcycled surplus product, feted Earth Day with its new campaign: Better Republic. It features eco-friendly products that will be sold online on vintage marketplace Thrilling.  An environment-friendly method of supporting local small businesses – of which 95% are owned and operated by women. 
In a related move, Banana Republic also reaffirmed its sustainability goals. For instance, it promised to use 100% sustainable cotton and 50% sustainable fibers by 2023, as well as create far more denim via Gap Inc.’s Washwell program, which uses less water and and far more sustainable dye processes.  
 
While Wrangler, “in honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day,” announced that it had managed to save 7 billion liters of water in its denim manufacturing processes since 2008, surpassing its own goal of 5.5 billion liters. Rival Lee Jeans also announced plans to power 100 percent of all owned and operated facilities with renewable energy by 2025; and to source 100 percent sustainably-grown or recycled cotton by 2025.
 
Internationally, younger dynamic brands like Pangaia, Riley Studio and Horizon Athletic sum up our current obsession with creating fashion that manages to be chic yet also sustainable.
 
Pangaia celebrated the half-century by developing new T-shirts in peppermint seaweed fibers, and puffer jackets filled with FLWRDWN, a cruelty-free alternative to goose feathers, made out of wildflowers. 
Riley Studio, by cool Chelsea influencer Riley Uggla, uses recycled materials from ethical partners, all the way to the neck labels, composed on a bio-based plastic alternative that can be placed in a compost bin and broken down within 24 weeks. As for Australian label Horizon Athletic, it has created active and swimwear ranges made of econyl, a recycled fiber made of abandoned fishing nets.
 
To fete Earth Day, Woolmark even teamed up with artist Timo Helgert to create a series of images of re-wildings in London, New York and Shanghai, with nature taking control again of said cities.  
In effect, the impact of Covid-19, as well as our enforced distance from nature, has also served to underline our love of flora, fauna and wildlife. Perhaps Timberland best summed up the mood with a video prose poem, Dear Nature, which poses the question: does nature wonder where we have all gone, why there are no planes in the sky?
 
“Dear nature, we miss you. Probably more than you miss us. Take this time to breathe, to bloom, and to conquer your space. And, when we are back, we promise to treat you better than we ever did before. Because now that we are distant from you we truly understand how much you really meant to us.”

"Apr 21, 2020","Peter Beard, the New York-born fashion icon, path-breaking wildlife photographer and forerunner of the ecological movement, has died at 82.
 
Beard, who suffered from dementia, was found dead inside Camp Hero State Park at the eastern tip of Long Island on Sunday, three weeks after going missing from his Montauk home, his family confirmed. 
“We are heartbroken by the confirmation of our beloved Peter’s death… He died where he lived in nature,” the family said in a statement.
 
Blessed with movie star looks and a bottomless taste for adventure, Beard became famous worldwide back in the 1960s with the publication of his book, The End of the Game, a series of photos and texts documenting the final days of white hunter colonial Africa, while also chronicling the endangered wildlife of the continent.Beard turned many of those very images into large photographic prints, finished with handwritten texts and often in diary form, handwritten in ink or even his own blood – bizarre and beautiful images that became much sought-after prints that nowadays grace the homes of literally dozens of designers. He also earned solo exhibitions in such hallowed spaces as the Center of Photography in New York and the Centre Nationale de la Photographie in Paris. Yet he was perhaps best-known as a diarist, sending his first writing back to Yale to complete his university thesis, his journals crammed with drawings, train tickets, images, scraps of wood, feathers and more of his own blood.
 
Born into privilege on the Upper East Side of New York, Beard was privately wealthy through his stockbroker father and great-grandfather, who founded the Great Northern Railway. Even so, he managed to combine a patrician air with an open and friendly manner.
 
His fame led to numerous photo shoots for Vogue and Elle, and he was an occasional front row fixture at the great runway shows of Paris and New York. He married one supermodel, Cheryl Tieg, and was alleged to have discovered another, Iman, claiming to have first met her in the African bush, while she insisted they met on the streets of Nairobi.
 
His life was definitely dissolute, as he was a denizen of Studio 54 and a recreational drug user. His life was also one of great danger. His single most famous image is one of himself lying on the ground, writing, with half his torso stuffed inside an enormous crocodile. Entitled “I’ll write wherever I can…”, it captured Beard in all his romantic glory.

That was posed, but an attack by a female elephant in the 1990s – who almost gored him to death – was not. Reportedly, he arrived at the local hospital without any pulse, and ended up needing 28 pins in his hip to be able to walk again.In later life, he crusaded to save elephants long before the word ""ecology"" ever became commonly used, documenting the formers' deaths inside Tsavo National Park in Kenya. He owned his own 45-acre farm: Hog Ranch in Kenya, located beside Karen Blixen (the author of Out of Africa)'s coffee farm. She'd been a deep influence on Beard all of his life.
 
Beard was a friend of the Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Grace Jones and Francis Bacon, the latter having painted his portrait. Aged 17, he first went to Africa with Quentin Keynes, the grandson of Charles Darwin, enabling the beginning of a long life of exploration. Mixed with lots of drama, like during the 1977 fire in his home in Montauk that destroyed most of his negatives, alongside paintings by Picasso, Bacon and Warhol. In a word, he managed to personify Out of Africa, mixed with all of the ""Beautiful People"" and the world of fine art all at the same time.
 
He is survived by his wife Nejma Beard and daughter Zara Beard, as well as his brothers Anson Jnr and Samuel.

"Apr 21, 2020","U.S. exercise apparel brand Lululemon issued statements on Tuesday apologising for, and distancing itself from, a T-shirt design promoted by one of its art directors that triggered outrage and accusations of racism online.The hashtag ""Lululemon insults China"" was viewed 204 million times on China's Weibo platform by Tuesday afternoon, with some commentators demanding a boycott of the brand.

The furore started on Sunday, with an Instagram link posted by the Lululemon official, Trevor Fleming, that promoted the sale of a T-shirt on the website of California artist Jess Sluder, under the name ""bat fried rice"".The long-sleeved T-shirt, bearing an image of a pair of chopsticks with bat wings on the front and a Chinese takeout box with bat wings on the back, riled critics who said the two were trying to stir anti-Asian sentiment during the coronavirus pandemic.

""We acted immediately, and the person involved is no longer an employee of Lululemon,"" the firm said in an Instagram response to a customer on Tuesday, without identifying the individual.

It called the image and the post inappropriate and inexcusable, and apologised that one of its employees had been affiliated with promoting the offensive T-shirt.

Fleming did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters to seek comment. On his LinkedIn account, he said he worked at Lululemon up to April 2020.

Sluder did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Reports of racially charged assaults on Asians have grown since the pandemic first emerged in a market selling wildlife in China late last year, before spreading worldwide to infect 2.4 million people, with more than 169,000 deaths.

Early studies said the virus could have come from bats.

Before it was removed on Sunday, the post on Sluder's Instagram account read, ""Where did COVID-19 come from? Nothing is certain, but we know a bat was involved.""

It added, ""Beginning today, my limited edition #quarantees are now available. Link in bio or DM for details…Thank you for your support and sense of humor! #humornothat #batfriedrice"".

However, in the following days, Instagram users left more than a thousand comments on Luluemon's official account, accusing it of xenophobia.

China blocks Instagram within the country with what is known as its Great Firewall.

A separate statement posted on Lululemon's official Weibo account on Tuesday did not apologise, but said the design was not a Lululemon product and the firm opposed ""any discriminatory behaviours"".

It was not the first time Lululemon has faced criticism of being insensitive. In 2013, Chip Wilson, the founder of the cult yoga clothier, apologised for remarks suggesting that some women's bodies ""don't work"" in the brand's pants.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Apr 21, 2020","Almost one month after its rivals in Milan and Paris cancelled their menswear and couture runway seasons set for this summer, the British Fashion Council has announced it is going ahead with its June season - albeit in a co-ed digital format. 
The BFC, UK fashion’s ruling body, also revealed that “for next 12 months” all of the London Fashion Weeks will become co-ed seasons staged on one gender-neutral platform. Meaning that London Fashion Week: Men’s will cease to exist for the next year at least. The BFC called this a move “to allow designers greater flexibility.”
 
The immediate effect is that the the next London Fashion Week Men’s season, originally scheduled for the weekend of June 12-14, will be rebranded as a “digital-only platform in light of the current environment,” the organisation said in a release Tuesday.Back on March 28, both the Camera della Moda and the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, respectively the governing fashion bodies in Italy and in France, announced the postponements their next menswear seasons and the Paris haute couture runway season this summer. While the Council of Fashion Designers of America also annulled its summer season, as the three organisations reacted in tandem to the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
However, the BFC has taken a different tack by going ahead with a rebranded platform, www.londonfashionweek.co.uk, designed for both trade and consumer audiences; and meant to embrace the cultural commentary, creativity and humorous spirit of London.
 
However, so far, the BFC has not listed which designers or brands will participate in the June season in London. Instead, it merely stressed that the season’s goal would be to allow British fashion businesses and creative to tap into London’s cultural zeitgeist and highlight its position as a global multi-cultural city. “Bringing the fashion community together, the platform will host exclusive multimedia content from designers, creatives, artists and brand partners, enabling collaboration and bringing together fashion, culture and technology,” the BFC added.
 
The BFC's long-term goal is to maintain four runway seasons in London – in January, February, June and September – however, it remains to be seen if the September season will have any live runway formats with audiences present. 
 
“It is essential to look at the future and the opportunity to change, collaborate and innovate. Many of our businesses have always embraced London Fashion Week as a platform for not just fashion but for its influence on society, identity and culture,” commented Caroline Rush, BFC Chief Executive.
 
“The current pandemic is leading us all to reflect more poignantly on the society we live in and how we want to live our lives and build businesses when we get through this. The other side of this crisis, we hope will be about sustainability, creativity and product that you value, respect, cherish. By creating a cultural fashion week platform, we are adapting digital innovation to best fit our needs today and something to build on as a global showcase for the future. Designers will be able to share their stories, and for those that have them, their collections, with a wider global community; we hope that as well as personal perspectives on this difficult time, there will be inspiration in bucket loads. It is what British fashion is known for,” Rush added. 
 
Among the facilities to be deployed will be interviews, podcasts, designer diaries, webinars and digital showrooms, aimed at generating sales. 
 
The BFC is also linking up with brands like Amazon Launchpad, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Joor, Ordre/Orb360 and YouTube, to develop content in unique ways. While its longstanding brand partners British GQ, Evening Standard, JD.com, inc, Lavazza, LetsBab, Mercedes-Benz, The May Fair Hotel and Toni&Guy, have reaffirmed their support for the June season.

"Apr 21, 2020","The Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue have now successfully raised over $4 million in relief funding through A Common Thread, the initiative put together by the partners to support members of the American fashion community impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 800 applicants have submitted to receive aid from A Common Thread since applications opened on April 8, according to multiple reports. No individual grant will exceed $100,000. 

First announced on March 24, contributors to the fund have included PVH, which donated $50,000; Ralph Lauren, who donated $1 million; and Gucci parent company, Kering. In addition, the Elaine Gold Launch Pad program, a program created in partnership with the Accessories Council and the CFDA to support companies between zero and three years of age, made a $250,000 donation to A Common Thread, and pledged an additional match of up to $250,000 in donations, the CFDA said. 

According to reports, the committee hopes to have the first payments made by May.

Globally, The CFDA and Vogue's effort to support its native fashion community have been shared by similar initiatives like the British Fashion Council’s BFC Foundation Fashion Fund for the Covid Crisis and the Camera della Moda fund in Milan. 

Elsewhere in the fashion world, brands and companies including AG Jeans, American Eagle, Capri Holdings, Estée Lauder, Tapestry Inc. and more have made significant contributions to help provide assistance during the Covid-19 crisis; from monetary donations, to launching the production of hand sanitizer and Personal Protective Equipment.

"Apr 16, 2020","Keeping any business alive these days is no easy task, doubly so for a family business like Missoni, whose creative director Angela Missoni is the daughter of the founder.
 
As Italian lockdown began, Angela quit her airy apartment in Milan, which overlooks the Giardini Pubblici, and went back to home base: a villa in Sumirago, where the family first began manufacturing their beautiful sweaters back in 1969. 
Her mother Rosita is close by, as are her two daughters, Margherita and Theresa, and their three grandsons; several other grand nephews; one grand niece and the rest of the clan. All hunkering down, but still very much working.
 
We caught up with Angela, the single most influential knitwear designer in fashion today, for her take on sheltering through the pandemic, preparing for the next season in September and what we might learn from this unique moment in world history. “In Italy, I think we invented the idea of smart working before someone else gave it that name. We often have up to 60 people doing home working. And, right now, I have pattern cutters close to hand. After we came back to Sumirago, we spent two weeks working in plant and then, when the order came from the government, we closed it immediately,” said Angela.
 
She is right now working on the collection she plans to show in September during the Milan's next Fashion Week. Since, the Camera della Moda cancelled the menswear runway season scheduled for June, and like most houses, Missoni expects to present a co-ed show in the fall.
 
“We speak about the show every day. But it won’t be like before. We need something diverse in September. We expect to stage a show, even if only to 200 people. Frankly, I have no idea how many people will come to Milan. Maybe, we’ll make a video presentation in a theater. By definition, there will have to be social distancing. Look, many Japanese people have been wearing masks for quite a while when they come to Milan, so we’ll all have to get used to that,” she shrugged in a morning WhatsApp conversation.
 The designer stressed that there is no shortage of ideas from her team during lockdown – many fresh proposals for future projects or new merchandising ideas have risen. 

“We speak everyday in video conferencing. Matter of fact, I think I have installed about five different methods from Tim to Zoom and others. Whatever works,” she laughed. 
 
Missoni’s pre-collection for fall – introduced before its last show in late February – sold extremely well, Angela explained. However, once the real dangers of Covid-19 became apparent, no retailers came back to Milan in late March to confirm their orders, and Missoni rapidly began scaling back production.
 
Does she see a major change in fashion change after we get through the pandemic?
 
“Look, when I looked in my crystal ball,” chuckles Angela, making a circling gesture with her hands, “I see that this idea of investing to distinguish yourself by dressing a certain way will not change at all. However, in my view, there will be a strong new sensibility in the new generation about the idea of rediscovering and using what was in your wardrobe. Longstanding values will become more important, which in my view is what we have done in Missoni. So, I am optimistic in the sense that Missoni has a role in the future. It’s a product that gives a sense of guarantee and security and protection,” she concluded.
 
The house has also been busy in other departments.
 
M Missoni, under the direction of daughter Margherita, last week announced a link-up with AwaytoMars - known as “the world’s first 100% user-created fashion brand.” AwaytoMars has opened its co-creation platform to allow designers to submit ideas inspired by three themes – hand-picked by Margherita – from the fashion label's archives. 
 
Back in February, Missoni also acquired 100% of T&J Vestor, gaining control over the Italian home textile brand that had licensed Missoni Home.
 
Like others, Angela first realized how serious this all was from images from China back in January.
 
“From the moment Wuhan closed down, we knew it was going to be a punch for our industry. Even if we didn't think the result would be so bad in Italy,” she sighed.
 
Ironically, 2020 was the year when Missoni was planning to open its first boutiques in China, a key goal for the house in the fall. But everything is on hold now. In 2018, private equity firm Fondo Strategico Italiano acquired a 41-percent stake in Missoni, with ambitious plans for the future, including an eventual stock market listing in 2023.
 
Does fashion, an industry of incessant travel, bear some blame for the pandemic?
 
“I don’t know about that. But if you look at Lombardy – the region that is so badly hit – and you ask how come Italy has fared worse than other countries? Well, Italy is country made of thousands of small businesses and factories. And, all of them are working for China. Plus, all of them have some member of staff who travels to China. So, maybe it’s that simple fact, so much travel and back and forth,” she believes.
 
How, one wondered, has the pandemic affected her creative ideas? 
 
“The ideas are always in your head. Personally speaking, they don’t come to me from going out or foreign travel. Today, we are all exposed to lots of ideas via our connection to the web. It’s not like turning magazine or book pages in the past. Can you imagine even ten years ago what this isolation would have been like without the Internet!” she noted. 
Angela doubts that Covid-19’s impact will be short-lived, and expects little tourism in Milan until next year. In the past decade, the city has become a major new tourist destination – with over four million visitors annually. And in a bigger sense, she expects the industry to change too. 
 
“There is something out of synch in our industry. Ultimately, it's crazy that most people sell most of their collections before they show their clothes on a runway! Plus, the clothes are only ever in a store for a very short time at any season – a couple of months at most. For huge brands with multiple stores, where three quarters of their revenues are their own retail businesses, then a show has a function in terms of image and marketing. But for people like us, based on 75% to 80% on wholesale, the system makes far less sense. I am not sure what the next step is, but something has to change,” she concluded.
 
The designer was fulsome in her praise for Carlo Capasa, the president of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, Italian fashion’s governing body. Notably his recent call for more government support, noting that roughly 40% of the world’s luxury production is made in Italy.
 
“In the end, creativity is what will save us, per fortuna. If we can survive, we can continue to create. 
But, we need responses from the government, financial support for fashion brands. So, far, we haven’t received anything. And, we expect some help from Europe, but none of this has arrived.”
 
Has this time meant greater connection to your community in social media? 
 
“I’d say it is more like social scarcity – I lack the structure. I know we need to be more present, but 
I am a designer and company president and when I am this table to from 9 to 7 I seem very busy,” she laughed. 
 
Does she see influencer influence waning, as their oxygen, dressing for very public events, has dried up?
 
“They are not so pertinent now maybe because they don’t have so much to say other than just, ‘this is how I look’,” she sniffs.
 
Coming out of the pandemic, Angela sees a reinforcement of certain values.
 
“We will keep the values of this time, this rediscovery of family. When you spend your whole day with your kids that reminds of their importance – so it’s a beautiful opportunity. And these young kids will note that difference, this sense of closeness to them. It’s a moment when one witnesses the springtime together, and that is a real privilege.”

"Apr 14, 2020","The LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers has called off the final of this year’s event, and instead plans to direct its prize money into a fund for young designers, in the latest cancellation due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The LVMH Prize, fashion’s single largest award for young designers, had been scheduled for June 5 at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. This would have been its seventh final. Instead, the 300,000-euro prize money will be distributed among the eight finalists, who were chosen by the Committee of Experts of 68 noted fashion professionals during the semi-final on February 27 and 28 inside LVMH’s headquarters.

“The health crisis poses an economic threat to young talent. That is why the LVMH Prize has set up a Fund in aid of young fashion designers that will notably be supplemented by the 2020 Karl Lagerfeld Prize allocation,” the giant luxury group explained in a release.This fund is designed to benefit all winning designers and their registered brands – both of the LVMH or the Karl Lagerfeld Prize – as of the last six years. Previous winners and runner-ups have included such stars as Grace Wales Bonner, Jacquemus, Marine Serre and Marques'Almeida

“Since its launch, the LVMH Prize has promoted and nurtured young talent. Each year, it places the spotlight on young designers from all over the world and supports the development of their companies,” said Delphine Arnault, the main driving force behind the award.

“In this challenging context, this Fund in aid of young fashion designers highlights the main mission of the LVMH Prize by supporting our former winners,” added Arnault, scion of the family that controls LVMH, which includes such legendary brands as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy.

In effect, this year’s eight finalists will receive an award of 40,000 euros each. They are Priya Ahluwalia of Ahluwalia, Charaf Tajer of Casablanca, Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena of Chopova Lowena, Nicholas Daley, Peter Do, Sindiso Khumalo, Supriya Lele and Tomotaka Koizumi’s Tomo Koizumi label.

As for the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, which comes with a cash award of 150,000 euros, it will go directly into the fund for young designers.

The jury for the final has grown over the years, and altered as designers have joined or departed the LVMH fold. This year’s panel included Rihanna, Virgil Abloh and Stella McCartney.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 14, 2020","Adidas has taken the next step in its work with 3D printing specialist Carbon. After originally reimagining high-performance footwear using the technology, it's now producing 3D-printed face shields to help with the Covid-19 crisis.The shields will support American healthcare organisations, first responders and “underserved communities that have the greatest need and don't have access to adequate supplies,” it said.

The German sports giant said this week that it’s using the same material co-created for its 4D midsoles, a “highly elastic, tear-resistant material called Elastomeric Polyurethane”. It’s being applied to the creation of personal protective equipment (PPE) that can be sanitised and reused, “with the hopes of eliminating waste during a time of scarcity”.It also claims the material “provides a more comfortable alternative to support those in the front lines as they work long hours, continuing to risk their lives to save others”.

The group said that with its support and the quick production turnaround that 3D printing enables, “Carbon has been able to scale production from 18,000 face shields a week to upwards of 50,000”.

And in order to boost that still further, Carbon is also sharing print files with its entire global network “so anyone with access to a Carbon printer and material will be able to create face shields to address needs in their local areas”.

Organisations that need face shields can submit a request at www.carbon3d.com/covid19 or by email to covid19@carbon3d.com.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 14, 2020","Fashion labels Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot have pledged to stop using the leathers of crocodiles, lizards, snakes and other reptiles. Representatives of the French fashion group, which operates the three ready-to-wear labels, “have confirmed to PETA they are stopping the sale of exotic leather articles,” said the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) association to FashionNetwork.com, in a statement.
 While several labels have gradually decided to stop using animal fur in their collections, Chanel was the first, in 2018, to announce it was adopting the same policy for reptile leather. Victoria Beckham, Vivienne Westwood and Paul Smith, among others, followed suit, as did Versace, which stopped using kangaroo leather.

Recently, the leading luxury groups have also pledged to safeguard the well-being of animals. Last year, LVMH, which operates its own crocodile breeding farms, adopted new, stricter supplier selection standards in order to ensure it is sourcing responsibly. Hermès and Kering are instead working with the breeding farms of the International Crocodilian Farmers Association (ICFA), set up in 2016, whose standards define the best practices for animal well-being, working conditions and environmental protection.“Each article made with snake or alligator leather translates into suffering for the animals the leather comes from, sometimes skinned while still alive and fully conscious,” said Mathilde Dorbessan, in charge of corporate relations for PETA.
 
“We praise this excellent decision by the SMCP group, indicative of a highly compassionate attitude, and we urge other labels to follow such a fine example,” added Dorbessan.

In the last few years, PETA has carried out several investigations on cruelty in animal treatment, putting pressure on luxury labels to stop using fur and exotic leathers. It has now turned its attention to the use of wool, cashmere and mohair, denouncing several instances of exploitative practices in the wool industry worldwide.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 9, 2020","The textile and apparel industries have virtually ground to a halt in Europe - and are gingerly getting going again in Asia - and the decision to cancel the majority of men’s Fashion Weeks and the main trade shows in June has caused major repercussions. How can fashion labels manage without the huge visibility opportunity afforded by catwalk shows? Where and when will they showcase their Spring/Summer 2021 collections, now that they won’t be able to tap the scores of international buyers flocking to the world’s fashion capitals?
 These are the questions luxury labels are currently mulling, having been caught short by the cancellations decided by the leading fashion industry bodies in Paris, Milan and New York. The Paris Fashion Week scheduled on June 23-28 has been cancelled. The Milan Fashion Week Men, initially planned on June 19-23, has been rescheduled in September, and will be staged during the womenswear Week, on September 22-28. The New York Fashion Week was due to be held on June 8-10, but has been postponed, with no indication of the new dates.
 
Following these decisions, the trade shows usually held in Paris at the end of June (Man, Splash Paris, Tranoï, Unique, Interfilière and View) have also been cancelled, while Pitti Uomo, the marquee menswear event which usually opens the season in mid-June, has been pushed back to September 2-4, and will last three days rather than the customary four.FashionNetwork.com has contacted luxury labels like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, Valentino, Brioni and Berluti, but the majority of them declined to answer. According to some, “it’s too early [to say],” or “we are assessing the situation,” or “we are working hard on all fronts to deal with the rapidly evolving situation,” or “we are still reorganising internally, and we need time before we can make a statement.”

Reactions that offer a glimpse of the disarray fashion labels are experiencing at the moment, faced with a highly uncertain, ever-changing situation. Only Kering-owned Gucci took a clear stand, and announced that its menswear collection will be showing in Milan in September, “in line with the decision taken by the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI).” More generally, Gucci too thinks “that it is still too early to take a decision on future sales campaigns,” but that the label will be ready “whatever the final decision will be.”
 
Meanwhile, Gucci is relying on e-tail, like many other labels ever since lock-down measures were first imposed. The Italian luxury label, capitalising on a pilot project trialled in recent months, has “activated a digital showroom experience accessible to all the buyers and clients who would normally travel to view the collection.” This has enabled Gucci “to digitally replicate a showroom experience in an innovative way, giving the possibility of accessing 360º views of the various garments, to zoom in on certain details and to buy the items selected, all through the same tool.”
 
Lardini, an Italian high-end menswear brand which is also a supplier to other labels, will present the collection to international buyers online, while in Italy it will be presented at its regional agents’ showrooms. However, Creative Director Luigi Lardini thinks that it will not be possible to sell the Spring/Summer 2021 collection in September, despite the fact that Pitti Uomo and other menswear shows are going to be staged that month.

Some of Lardini’s multibrand clients, especially from the label's second most important market, Japan, are pushing to receive the first samples by mid-May. “For this reason, we won’t take part in the next edition of Pitti Uomo. We think that holding the show in September is pointless, since no one will want to buy then, given that the summer collection must be shipped to overseas clients from November-December. It would have been much more helpful for us if Pitti had staged a virtual show in June,” complained Luigi Lardini.

He has already ordered the fabrics for the collection, and isn’t worried about producing it, provided that the factories which are currently closed will be authorised to re-open “by April 18-19 at the latest. The main problem is lack of clarity from the government and public authorities. People want to have a degree of security and assurance,” said Lardini.
 Pal Zileri, another luxury Italian menswear label, which usually presents the new collection for its young line, Lab Pal Zileri, at Pitti Uomo, has confirmed it will attend the Florentine show’s next edition. “There will be a big rush in September, but it's important for the whole industry to get together at the show, because business must re-start. We must broadcast a strong message; the whole fashion system needs it. We are actually going back to the way things were in the 1980s, when the menswear collections where presented with womenswear. And this might turn into an opportunity to change the current Fashion Week rhythm, which everyone is complaining about,” said Maria Rosaria Lombardi, Pal Zileri’s communication and marketing director.
 
Carla Sozzani, at the helm of Milanese luxury concept store 10 Corso Como, is of the same opinion: “Rescheduling in a less cluttered period, one that is more consistent with the seasons, would allow for more innovative content to be developed,” she said, adding that “these are very difficult times.”
 
Pal Zileri has already designed the summer 2021 collection, and its production has started. But the Covid-19 emergency forced the group, like its competitors, to change plans. “It's clear that the summer sales campaign will be scaled down. It will be absolutely impossible for foreign buyers to come to Milan in June. As a result, we’re about to start setting up a virtual showroom,” said Lombardi.
 
“If businesses in Italy were able to start working again after Easter, on April 16  or thereabouts, this would make it possible for summer collections to be delivered by the end of June, and for work on the winter season to begin. Actually, what's good about not having shows in the month of June is that labels no longer have a sword hanging over their heads, and enjoy more flexibility in creating their collections,” said Claudio Marenzi, CEO of Italian outerwear label Herno and president of Pitti Immagine and Confindustria Moda, the association of Italy’s fashion and textile industry companies.
 
According to Marenzi, it is impossible to imagine now, in the midst of Italy’s lock-down period, what the mood of retailers and buyers will be in June. “We must figure out when they will be mentally prepared to make purchases for summer 2021. I doubt this will happen in June. The sales campaign will probably extend until September. That will be the crucial time of the season, and sales will either be made virtually or, as in the old days, by packing up the new collection in the car and going out to show it to distributors,” he said.
 
“Labels looking to sell between June and August will surely end up selling less than those that are aiming for September, because retailers won’t be ready to buy so soon. And there will be more time to produce the collection. Surely, the industry will begin to get going at the end of August,” said Marenzi.
 
Questions abound and rumours are rife, given the current uncertainty and the lack of clarity about the type of measures that will be implemented once the lock-down will begin to ease. In September, the Fashion Weeks will probably be forced to adopt a different, more streamlined format, with limited audiences.
 
It has been quietly whispered that London and New York may cancel the September fashion weeks too. Like Milan, Paris might stage mixed shows, presenting menswear and womenswear together. According to some, a pared-down menswear week might even be tacked on the end of the Paris Fashion Week Women at the beginning of October.
 
The French Fashion and Haute Couture Federation has said that planning the September ready-to-wear Fashion Week isn’t yet on the agenda. Given the situation, all scenarios are still possible. But as of today, nothing has been decided.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Apr 8, 2020","Donald Trump may be mulling over cutting funds to the World Health Organization, but the house of Patou has launched a fashion project, for which 100% of the revenues are destined to WHO.Tagged as #PatouGether, Patou began selling Patou sweatshirts and a Patou tee shirt on patou.com this Wednesday morning.
 
“Patou will donate 100% of the proceeds to the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic across the world,” the house said in a release.Available in black and white, the 100% cotton crewneck sweatshirts are priced at €250 euros and delivered in a GOTS-certified organic cotton envelope. The cotton T-shirts cost $130, and like the sweatshirts are available on the house’s website.
 
Customers are encouraged to join a #PatouTeam at home, and take a photo of themselves in the sweatshirt or ""Tee"" and then share it on social media.
 
Founded in 1914 by Jean Patou, who dressed Louise Brooks, Joséphine Baker and Mistinguett, the house employed several legendary designers – including Karl Lagerfeld and Jean-Paul Gaultier -  after the death of its founder in 1936. In 2018, LVMH re-launched the fashion house; installed Guillaume Henry as artistic director and opened a new headquarters a stone’s throw from Notre-Dame.

"Apr 7, 2020","At a moment of compulsory cocooning due to the curse of Covid-19, Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director of Christian Dior, has been doing things very much in the Italian way. She hunkered down with la famiglia in Rome. Specifically, with her daughter Rachele Regini, who is cultural advisor in the creative department of Dior.
 
“I am with my daughter Rachele; we are isolation in our family home in Rome. We are all living through this crisis together so I think it’s very important to stay calm and take refuge in our creativity.   I am extremely fortunate to say that I am well, and that my family and friends are, too,” explained Chiuri.
 “Being healthy and being able to be at home is a privilege, so we really have to remember how lucky we are,” added the Italian designer in an exchange with FashionNetwork.com from Italy.
 
Both she and Regini now share an apartment in the historic centre of the Italian capital, perched high among the steeples and cupolas of Rome, and overlooking an orange garden where cloistered nuns walk and meditate.Chiuri has always been a creator who works closely with her team and atelier. Someone who knows what it means to rise through the ranks. After studying at the Istituto Europeo di Design in Rome, she joined Fendi in 1989, becoming responsible for many of the house's hit accessories. In 1999, she joined Valentino and ended up in charge of the creative direction of Red Valentino, along with design partner Pierpaolo Piccioli. A decade later, she and Pierpaolo took over the direction of the whole house of Valentino, before she was nominated to one of the most prestigious jobs in fashion: couturier and women’s creative director of Christian Dior, in 2016. The first woman designer ever at Dior, following in the footsteps of such legends as Yves Saint Laurent, John Galliano, Gianfranco Ferré and, of course, the great Monsieur Dior himself.
 
Since arriving at Dior, Chiuri has injected a welcome feminist point-of-view; while managing contemporaneously to create an insouciant yet gutsily elegant style. Now, for such a hands-on designer, the sheer distance from her team has required her to come up with new methods to stay connected or to work.
 
“Technology is helping us to stay in touch, like having meetings via FaceTime and working by phone on a daily basis. The staff of the atelier in Paris are working from home and they send me photo updates or videos of work in progress. Of course, sometimes it’s a challenge because I find that the best ideas often come from conversations and from people being in the same room, but I think we all need to adapt to this temporary situation. My team is well, and I think being home has sparked their creativity even more. I speak with them regularly, and I feel that there’s an even greater sense of energy there than before. Creativity is a safe space in which you can take refuge from the real world, so it’s become even more special now,” opines Maria Grazia.
 
Though Chiuri was born in Rome, Maria Grazia’s mother comes from Salento, in Puglia, the region that makes up the boot of the Italian peninsula. No country has suffered more of the virus than Italy, with over 16,500 deaths by Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 
“It’s impossible not to be affected by the situation. Of course, I am deeply saddened by what’s happening. I was proud to see so many Italian fashion brands, as well as Dior of course, producing masks and sanitizer for hospitals. We work closely with so many factories in Italy that my priority lies in supporting them and in continuing to support them after the crisis has abated,” explained the couturier. 
Unlike many in fashion, she is not hyper connected to her social media community, seeing this time is a moment for reflection and respecting people's space both physically and virtually in the lockdown.
 
“I use it (social media) sporadically, but not as much. I am quite occupied with work and spending time with my family. I'm ultimately not a very digital person!” 
 
Chiuri’s latest show for Dior was staged inside a tent in the Tuileries gardens in late February during Paris Fashion Week. A brilliant display, entitled Rivolta Femminile, where the inspiration was Chiuri’s own rebellion against bourgeois norms and dress codes in her youth in the Eternal City. Staged underneath giant neon signs designed by the Claire Fontaine collective, one could read: Women are the Moon that Moves the Tides, or When Women Strike the World Stops.
 
Remarkably, with the benefit of hindsight and the appreciation of how vital social distancing is to break the tide of Covid-19, it is remarkable that nearly 2,000 of us showed up to that show, practically rubbing shoulders as we sat down in the bleachers inside the tent.
 
Looking back, Maria Grazia concedes that she realized early on the severity of the pandemic.
 
“I understood the severity of this crisis right away when the news about China first started. I remember it was right before the last autumn-winter show. I was working very hard but my mind kept returning to thinking about what was unfolding,” she recalled.
 
Since then, Dior has cancelled its planned cruise show in Chiuri’s mother’s native Puglia, scheduled for early May. Moreover, French fashion authorities have also called off the next haute couture season, traditionally held in early July. Meaning that Chiuri’s next runway show for Dior will not be until the end of September, with the spring 2021 ready-to-wear season in Paris.
 
Now, after weeks of confinement and reflection, does she believe that the old ways of staging fashion seasons with all the obligatory travel will change?
 
“I don’t think anyone can tell right now. I think the whole world will have to adjust to new routines, and fashion will have to do it too, at least for some time. It’s very hard to predict how things will change down the line. I'm focusing primarily on the present, taking things day by day and seeking refuge in my creativity. I don’t think it’s wise to go out of your way to try to predict the future, I simply think there will be some adjustments to make and that we have to be ready to embrace these changes,” she concludes.

"Apr 6, 2020","It seems as though spring has only just begun, but many of us are already looking forward to warmer days to come and wondering about this year's swimwear trends. According to the most recent report from Stylight (Stylight), retro-inspired 1980s looks, bows, pastel colors, and animal prints could all be big this summer. One of the most remarkable developments, which is not strictly speaking a swimwear design trend, is the enthusiasm with which fashion addicts are already looking at forthcoming offerings of what are essentially summer pieces. In response to quarantines and the global health crisis, consumers appear to have given up on shopping for the spring, and are instead seeking looks for next season in the hope of wearing them to the full. In March, Stylight noted an 83% growth in swimwear clicks on its international platforms over the same period last year. And this increase has been in the making since the month of January.Bows, flounces and frillsAdding a fanciful touch of glamour, there will be flounces and frills aplenty on this summer's swimwear, which will offer a plethora of dressed-up beach looks. However, and in spite of all expectations to the contrary, vacation suitcases will not be loaded with vibrant colors but with pastel shades, which are particularly sought-after by users of the fashion search engine. The strength of this trend has been underscored by a colossal increase of 2,582% in clicks on Stylight when compared to the same period last year.

As a general rule, bows are also big in fashion searches, where the category has attracted a steep 1,273% climb in the number of clicks. And the principle that what works on the street will also work on the beach is also evident in a surge in enthusiasm for 1980s-inspired high-cut bottoms and animal prints — notably zebra, python and leopard-skin motifs. Both categories have registered increases of more than 1,000% in the number of clicks when compared to the same period last year. Last but not least, this year's holidays will be characterized by a rush for ruffles with an increase of 665% in clicks. Look out for them on straps, collars, necklines, and bikini bottoms, where they will be adding a note of glamour in many different ways.Beachwear and sustainable fashionAs evidenced elsewhere in the world of fashion, consumers are increasingly interested in hybrid clothing that can be reused on many different occasions. Not surprisingly then, there is significant enthusiasm for swimwear tops and bras that serve not only in the surf and on the beach but also on the street. Stylight reports a 183% increase in the number of clicks in this category when compared to last year.

With regard to the swimwear brands that are most sought-after by fashionistas, Bond-Eye tops the list, ahead of Luli Fama, Vitamin A, Frankies Bikinis, and Prana. Note the presence in this top-5 of two green labels, Vitamin A and Prana, both of which make use of organic, eco-responsible and recycled materials in their swimsuits.

The Stylight report is based on internal data collected by the search engine from its 12 million monthly users on its various international platforms. The period from which data was selected was from January 1, 2020 to March 15, 2020, and this was compared to data for the same period in the previous year. The ranking for the most sought-after brands was based on the most clicked products.

"Apr 6, 2020","Few designers were busier than Alessandro Dell’Acqua when coronavirus cruelly claimed its first victims in Milan and Paris, at the same time as the women’s ready-to-wear seasons in Europe. For the simple reason that Dell’Acqua staged shows in both cities, right when the realization of how dangerous the pandemic really is first began to hit the world – and the fashion industry. 
Dell’Acqua staged the 10th anniversary collection of his own house, N°21, in Milan on February 19. Four days later, on Sunday, Feb 23, amid the first media reports of deaths from Covid-19 in Lombardy, Giorgio Armani announced he would hold his runway show behind closed doors, as the streets of Milan and supermarket shelves rapidly emptied. By February 26, when Alessandro presented his final collection for Rochas inside the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, scores of people had already died.
 
At the time, Armani was criticized by some for insufficient esprit du corps, especially after all but two designers on the official French calendar went ahead and staged their shows. With hindsight, it seems remarkable given the widespread medical opinion (which states that social distancing is essential to stop the growth of the virus) that literally hundreds of editors, buyers, publicists and models all rubbed shoulders, sitting side by side at scores of shows just five weeks ago. Meaning only two months after the first news reports about coronavirus came in from Wuhan.“Perhaps we would have had to be more responsible and act more quickly. I think the best example is Giorgio Armani, who, before anyone else, bravely decided to show behind closed doors,” said Dell’Acqua.
 
Many people are already predicting that the pandemic will leave a lasting mark of fashion, to which Dell’Acqua responds: “I think we will need to concentrate on less collections, smaller collections, but more quality and creativity. We will all have to focus on local talents and local production.”
 
Could this be a reset button in fashion globally?
 
“Nothing will be the same, our life will change drastically. Generally, I think that we will all have to take more responsible and ethical behavior on all levels,” said the designer in series of email responses from Milan.
 
Since returning to Italy, Alessandro has been in lockdown with his partner in Milan.
 
“I am at home in self isolation with my partner and my dog Gringo. The rest of my family is in Naples, I miss them terribly, especially my nephews but luckily they are all well,” adds Dell’Acqua, who was born in the charming Chiaia neighborhood of Naples.
 N°21 is based in Milan, and him and his team connect regularly via video conferencing,  although Alessandro clearly yearns for the daily interaction with his tight-knit team.
 
“All my team is currently safe and healthy. We are all connected with each other from home in smart working. As a creative director, I am really missing the relationship with the production team, especially with pattern-makers and seamstresses. I lack a personal and continuous exchange with my style office and my press office,” he revealed.
 
Given the current context, with death’s ugly hand taking thousands worldwide daily, it seems odd to note that Dell’Acqua is often described as one of fashion’s great survivors.
 
After studying advertising graphics at Istituto d'arte Umberto Boccioni in Naples, he took an eight-hour train journey to Milan in 1982. At the age of 18, he landed his first job as a junior designer in Brera. In a remarkable apprenticeship, Alessandro worked for Gianni Versace and Donatella Girombelli before launching his own brand in 1996. After immediate critical acclaim and growing commercial success, his initial investor fled to Mustique, and Dell’Acqua struggled on until losing control of his name in 2009. Therefore joining a club of lauded designers who also lost their own names – Halston, Roland Mouret and Helmut Lang, to name but a few.
 
However, within a couple of years, he found a white knight in Paolo Gerani of Iceberg, and together they have grown N°21 into one of Italy’s most happening brands. A style noted for its blend of the perverse with the sensual, along with a touch of torbido, meaning torrid in Italian. The brand now retails in 500 stores worldwide.
 
No wonder he is impatient to get back to work.
 
“As an entrepreneur, I keep up with the updates in terms of regulations and cannot wait to be able to have all the employees back in the office with me,” he says.
 
Inevitably, the isolation has begun to affect his creative ideas. Plus, the decision of the main continental menswear organizers to postpone the June salons and runway seasons in Florence, Milan and Paris, means Alessandro will have to radically reorganize his company’s schedule.
 
“I managed to deliver the pre-collection and the men’s collection. In terms of production, we will prioritize the pre-collection, which will be more of a focus. The men’s collection will be smaller too and hopefully, if production timing will allow, it will be integrated with women’s show collection in September,” he explains.
 
The lockdown has also allowed him time for something that was almost impossible before – talent spotting. 
 
“I spend most of the time in a long day dedicating myself to the search for emerging international designers, which - alas - in normal times I have no time to do. And I am going through my personal archive, photography books and old fashion magazines to get inspired,” he notes.
 
During cocooning, Alessandro’s Instagram is a blend of sketches; work in progress ideas; archive photos such as a marvelous Juergen Teller image of Stephanie Seymour in bourgeois underwear on a five-star hotel bed; and, curiously, a 1998 WWD news story announcing that Helmut Lang would become the first designer to present a show just on the Net.
 
“I am in fact spending a lot of time on Instagram. I feel like being closed to my community through my passion for fashion.  I have been posting many images of my recent and old work, of designers that I have always loved such as Helmut Lang and of young and upcoming designers such as Nensi Dojaka,” says Alessandro.
 
February also saw the end of his tenure at Rochas, after a seven-year stint where he injected a much-needed dose of classy Italian panache into the Paris house. Which was when he first began to comprehend the scale of the pandemic.
 
“The news of increasing number of contagious people in Italy really affected me. Fortunately, nobody from my family, my staff or my close circle of friends has be affected” adds a relieved Dell’Acqua.
 
The sheer brutal enormity of Covid-19 has also sparked an enormous Internet debate about the self-absorption of influencers and how it now looks passé and selfish.
 
“I think that really few influencers have been taking a real position in this difficult situation. In the future true and honest content will be key to survive,” he argues.

Looking ahead, he sees an era where, “we will all be more distant but digitally connected at the same time…. We will keep the passion and the love for what we do. But we will have to discard anything that it is not essential, unnecessary and excessive.”

"Apr 6, 2020","Leïla Menchari, the legendary designer of Hermès Paris flagship windows, has died. Known as France’s most famous window dresser, Menchari passed away on Saturday. “It is with great emotion and sadness that the House of Hermès learned on the 4th of April 2020 the passing of Leïla Menchari, the Queen of Enchantment, as Michel Tournier called her,” Hermès said in a release.
 
According to French media reports, Menchari was the latest victim of Covid-19.Born in 1927 in Tunis, Tunisia, Leïla was trained as a painter at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts before studying at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts (French National School of Fine Arts) in Paris, and being a model for Guy Laroche. She began working at Hermès in 1961, and was part of Annie Beaumel's decoration team. 
 
Hundreds of thousands of visitors to Paris would grow to know and admire Menchari’s work – since she had been dressing the windows of Hermès' Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré flagship since 1978. 
 
Over the years, Menchari created fantastical settings for Hermès windows: silver Rajasthan fantasies with princely thrones and silver gilt saddles; Moorish cavalry officer tents; remarkable golden crystal winged horses leaping from giant purple gemstones in a set littered with Kelly bags in matching hues; and Big Game Hunter safari windows replete with giant wooden elephants and Ashanti masks.
 
""Thanks to Leïla, exoticism found a home, happily and permanently, in Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré"", said CEO Axel Dumas. 
 
Until she retired in 2013, Menchari traditionally presided over the unveiling of her new windows four times a year in a near-religious ceremony where staff, Hermès fans and tourists would meet outside. A remarkable series of 137 windows, or as the French call them – vitrines.
 
In 2017, Hermès à tire-d'aile - les Mondes de Leïla Menchari, an exhibition celebrating her vision at the Grand Palais, allowed a younger audience to discover her rarefied and poetic universe. 
 
""Many of us at Hermès have learned a lot from Leïla. She taught us to look at the world through the prism of color. She was a storyteller without equal that enchanted the world. We are infinitely grateful to her for all that she has done for us, that she passed on to us,” added Hermès Artistic Director Pierre-Alexis Dumas. 
 
Her aesthetic was a particularly unique meeting of both sides of the Mediterranean, “the memory of a perpetual quest for beauty, a boundless passion for creation and craftsmanship,” noted Hermès.

Inside the Grand Palais, the house chose to build eight massive windows tableaux, with scenographer Nathalie Crinière working in tandem with Menchari. From a remarkable ecru and white Arcimboldo setting of busts, torsos and masks to a marvelous steel and leather stallion with a tooled leather space cowboy saddle, it’s a highly atypical exhibition. A tribute to a métier that in France becomes a work of art – where the sheer zest of the creation and assemblage of artisanal skill makes for images of real emotional power.
 
Addressing a rapt audience at the opening, the benevolent nonagenarian explained her design philosophy: “Windows are a method of telling a story. Each window is a little theatre, but more difficult than a stage as there is no text or movement. So, one has to become designer, painter, composer and director to make a great window. It’s that simple.”

"Apr 3, 2020","Supima, often dubbed the cashmere of cotton, has supplied dozens of alumni of its Supima Design Competition with fabric to create masks and gowns for medical workers and organizations on the frontlines in the Covid-19 struggle.After the cotton-grower federation put out a plea, 35 young designers responded by starting production of surgical masks and gowns in the increasingly rare fabric. 
 
Supima has also partnered with newly-formed organizations like Sew4lives and Operation Covid-19 Garment Revival to meet the rising demand for masks. All told, the graduates will make approximately 14,000 masks, destined to be donated to New York or any other local hospital. These masks will allow surgical and N95 masks to be reserved for those at greatest risk. 

“During these extraordinary circumstances, we are doing what we can to help our communities and hope you are able to do so as well, even if it just means practicing social distancing,” said Buxton Midyette, Supima's VP in Marketing & Promotions. She joined his wife Lisa at Supima’s office in NYC after cutting, packing and shipping out hundreds of meters of the fabric this week. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Apr 1, 2020","Copenhagen Fashion Week has announced that – at least for the moment – it plans to maintain its current dates, and will take place in the first week of August 2020.
 
That makes the Danish capital one of the few European runway seasons to keep its dates over the coming months. Last week, New York, Milan and Paris's menswear seasons, scheduled for this coming June, all decided to postpone their weeks. The French capital also called off its haute couture season, programmed for the first week of July. And New York annulled its resort season as well. 
Prior to that, multiple cruise collections set for April and May by global star brands like Prada, Gucci, Dior and Chanel were all called off. Plus, major ready-to-wear and accessories salons scheduled for June have been postponed.
 
However, in a release issued on Wednesday afternoon, Cecilie Thorsmark, CEO of Copenhagen Fashion Week, insisted: ""We continue to remain on target to execute the event in the first week of August as usual."" The official Danish dates are 4-7 August, 2020.
 
She did nonetheless caution that “uncertainty about how the virus will develop also makes it difficult to predict how this August's Copenhagen Fashion Week SS21 will turn out.”
 
For this reason, the Copenhagen Fashion Week and the trade fairs CIFF and Revolver, along with support from the industry associations DM&T and Wear, have gathered in what they termed “a unified strategy” for the upcoming edition of Copenhagen Fashion Week.
 
""Now is the time we to stand together and show that a coordinated effort can give Copenhagen Fashion Week SS21 wings, despite the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in currently. Copenhagen Fashion Week is devoted to lifting the Scandinavian industry and that's a responsibility that binds - also during this extraordinarily challenging time,"" stressed Thorsmark.
 
Though containing far fewer directional fashion designers than London, Milan or Paris, Copenhagen Fashion Week has gained significant traction in recent years, thanks to the discovering of happening Scandinavian labels which as a result led to the city to become a hipster center of street style.
 
The Danish allies also were careful to note that their “Fashion Week must be adapted to suit the industry's current situation. This implies that everyone must be willing to compromise about existing formats to accommodate the industry in the best way possible.”
 
Last week, Shanghai staged its own runway season effectively, and that, behind closed doors, without live audiences. The event was broadcast on platforms like Tmall to several millions viewers, leading other runway season organisers to consider presenting shows and designers in a similar manner.
 
""Most companies are affected by the corona virus and simply lack revenue and liquidity. The best thing we can do in this time of crisis is to figure out how to create the best conditions in terms of sales, business and public relations. That's why we're all ready to adapt to the circumstances to give the industry the support, visibility and the boost it needs right now,"" stressed Thorsmark.
 
She added that Copenhagen plans “to make a more specific announcement later this month about Copenhagen Fashion Week SS21.”
 
Moreover, Copenhagen Fashion Week’s own official site currently states on its application page: “for the sake of the current situation and understanding of your priorities right now, we do find it appropriate to postpone the application deadline to 5 May 2020.”

"Apr 1, 2020","Fashion houses have begun reaching out to their massive global communities via social media to encourage creativity at home, healthy living and inter-connectivity during the global lockdown caused by coronavirus.
 
Balmain, Karl Lagerfeld, Gucci and Alexander McQueen have all launched new initiatives this past week, with a wide variety of programs and proposals. Examples include yoga classes and live-stream DJ performances, as well as online catalogues of archived videos, courses in 3D creation and online embroidery. For its 40.1 million followers, Milan-based Gucci even dreamed up a course on health and well-being, partnering with The Sex Ed for –  a digital platform focused on wellness and sexuality – for a podcast.In Paris, Balmain unveiled #BalmainEnsemble, while Lagerfeld launched #Stayathomewithkarl. Over in London, Alexander McQueen has developed #McQueenCreators. Moreover, at a moment when classical ads for fashion and accessories (both in print and social media) seem almost in bad taste given the massive losses of lives in the pandemic, these initiatives introduce an almost holistic approach for many brands to give their giant social media communities.
 
Lagerfeld kicked off the action with a performance on Friday by DJ Chelina Manuhutu inside a skyline loft in Amsterdam, where one could witness her playing on a desk – on which lay a mini statue of the late Karl Lagerfeld.This evening will be Alexandra Raoufi (a staffer in the house’s ready-to-wear department, who is also a certified yoga instructor)'s turn. Tune in at 6PM CET, April 1, for her beginner-level class.
 
Also in the pipeline, Lagerfeld’s design director Hun Kim, who will be holding a drawing class. As well as Karl’s former personal assistant and the house’s brand ambassador, Sébastien Jondeau, who will be organizing an at-home workout.

 The house plans to notify its 6.1 million Instagram followers a day ahead of each event, and then stream them through Instagram stories before reposting the whole thing on the brand's feed for those who may want to watch it later.
 
“Created in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative seeks to help entertain people during this challenging period — hopefully bringing a smile to their faces while they are requested to remain inside their homes,” the house said in a release.On the other side of the Seine, creative director Olivier Rousteing began #BalmainEnsemble with a video reprise of his latest menswear collection, which was shown in January and featured African-inspired costumes, as a reference to the designer’s recent discovery that he is of half Ethiopian and half Somali origin.

“Let’s always remember we are stronger, we are bolder and more creative when we are together even when we are forced apart,” said Rousteing in a mini video on Instagram, to Balmain’s 10.1 million followers.
 
Next up are Style Files, where the house’s design team will offer home-bound Balmain Army members some weekly challenges. Or Global Atelier, when followers will be allowed video entrée into the design process and discussions on the song, themes, fabrics, and cuts selection for future seasons.The house of McQueen has been running repeated messages to its 9.5 million followers such as: ""Stay Home"", ""Protect the NHS"", and ""Save Lives"". This afternoon, it began #McQueenCreators with an invitation to sketch the dramatic and voluminous Rose dress that creative director Sara Burton designed for the brand's Autumn/Winter 2019 season. This sketching idea was taken from the Roses installation in McQueen’s New Bond Street flagship open studio. Future ideas include republishing images  created from brand followers across the former's social media. Or digital tutorials linking Alexander McQueen’s design studios to students and universities.
 
All of these initiatives demonstrating that the mentioned four houses are effectively keeping their communities close to them during the dark days of Covid-19.

"Apr 1, 2020","It has been slightly over a month since Richard Malone was crowned the winner of the 2020 International Woolmark Prize, but the prestigious international competition has already begun looking for the next big talent.Applications for the 2021/21 talent programme are now open, with emerging designers from all over the world encouraged to apply via the online portal on woolmarkprize.com.

All submissions will be reviewed by an Advisory Council of industry experts, who will look for  designers in the early stages of their career who have shown promise and dedication in growing a sustainable business.Ten finalists will have access to The Woolmark Company’s Innovation Academy, an 18-month education and mentoring programme covering everything from product development and research to business and sustainability strategies. And they will receive AU$70,000 (about $40,000) to develop a capsule collection to be presented at a final event in early 2021.

The overall winner of the International Woolmark Prize will receive AU$200,000 (about $120,000), with a second winner, recognised with the Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation, receiving a prize fund of AU$100,000 (about $60,000).

"Mar 30, 2020","The list of postponed and cancelled events around the world is getting longer every week. Following the blow that was the cancellation of Paris Fashion Week Men's Spring/Summer 2021, scheduled to take place from 23 to 28 June, and of Haute Couture Week Fall/Winter 2020-21, planned for 5 to 9 July 2020, a number of other events have now been forced to change their dates due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The eighth edition of Monte-Carlo Fashion Week, for example, was supposed to run from 14 to 18 May and boasted a programme including an exclusive runway show from Florentine fashion house Ermanno Scervino. The event, which sees stars from all over the world descend on the Principality of Monaco, has been pushed back to a later date. 

The same decision has been made concerning the 1.618 Biennale, which celebrates sustainable living in the company of a range of fashion, beauty and déco brands. Initially scheduled to take place between 5 and 7 June at Paris' Carreau du Temple, the Biennale's organisers have decided to host the event at an as yet unspecified later date. Finally, Marseille-based Maison Mode Méditerranée (MMM) is still determined to continue with the OpenMyMed Prize 2020/21, but is introducing a new format. ""More than ever, our chosen young fashion brands need to be listened to and reassured, and we came up with solutions before containment measures were put in place,"" the institution explained. First introduced by MMM in 2015, distance coaching allows experts to continue to support this edition's 13 chosen designers, who are spread over nine different countries. As for the second part of the competition, which was initially supposed to bring all the designers together in Marseille in June 2020, the event has been postponed until this autumn. 

Looking to a different sector, the 59th edition of the largest furniture fair in the world, the Milan Furniture Fair, which was scheduled for this April, will ultimately not take place. The fair's organisers had initially decided to postpone the event until June, but in a release published on Friday 27 March, the show's board of directors instead invited design fans and professionals to come to an event held from 13 to 18 April 2021, when the iconic fair will celebrate its 60th anniversary.

"Mar 28, 2020","As the Covid-19 outbreak disrupts fashion calendars across the globe, the Council of Fashion Designers of America has chosen to cancel New York Fashion Week: Resort 2021, and postpone New York's men's shows in June.  The announcement followed the news on Friday that Paris and Milan's next menswear seasons and Paris' haute couture week have also been postponed.""We are mindful of the global impact this pandemic has had on our day-to-day lives, our businesses and our people,"" the CFDA said in a statement. ""With that in mind, the CFDA has decided to cancel the official NYFW: Resort 2021 schedule of presentations.

""The decision was based on the current global situation, the ongoing uncertainty regarding its impact on retailers and their open-to-buys, and designers’ challenges in producing collections at this moment. We strongly recommend and urge designers NOT to show their Resort Spring 2021 collections.  The CFDA and the Fashion Calendar will not be publishing a Resort Schedule.""The CFDA, along with New York Men’s Day, Liberty Fairs and Project, further decided to postpone the June men’s shows and are working with the tradeshows to align on future dates.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak, fashion weeks have been canceled in Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Melbourne and Moscow.

"Mar 27, 2020","The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana in Milan, respectively the governing fashion bodies in France and Italy, have decided to postpone their next menswear seasons and the Paris haute couture runway season this summer. The measures are the latest major disruptions to the international fashion calendar caused by Covid-19.The French organization stressed in a release that “it is actively working with its members on possible alternatives,” without suggesting an alternative month.

“In light of the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic worldwide, strong decisions are required to ensure the safety and health of Houses, their employees and everyone working in our industry. Consequently, the Board of Directors of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode has come to the decision that, in the present conditions, the Paris Fashion Week Menswear, scheduled from June 23rd to June 28th, 2020, and the Haute Couture Week scheduled from July 5 to July 9, 2020, cannot take place,” it added.In a related move, the CNMI said that Milan men's fashion week, scheduled for 19-23 June, would take place during the Italian womenswear season in September.

“The decision was made necessary by the difficult situation caused by the widening Covid-19 pandemic,” the CNMI said in a release.

It added that it was working on “new digital formats and new ways of meeting in life,” for the days scheduled for Milan menswear, via B2B and B2C platforms.  

France's FHCM acted on the same day that the country announced an extension of its national lockdown. This was originally intended for 15 days starting at midday Tuesday, March 17, but has now been extended until April 15.

The FHCM and CNMI held just days ago a video conference with the other major fashion organizations running runway seasons, the British Fashion Council in London and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which augured for a united front in terms of dates.

For the moment, two other key European fashion seasons this summer have still not changed their dates: London men's fashion week and Pitti Uomo in Florence, both scheduled for June. However, the BFC is understood to be actively considering a fully digital season in London, and is expected to announce a decision next week. Pitti has just announced that it will make a definite decision on April 2.

Half will go to Italy and half to Spain. It is a factory in China that makes the masks,"" a H&M spokeswoman said in an email.

H&M said last week it was looking into using its supply network to source personal protective equipment for hospitals to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.The masks are of the N95/FFP2 standard that protects from the droplets through which the virus spreads.

"Mar 27, 2020","The British Fashion Council (BFC) said on Friday that it's launching a new crisis fund to support creative businesses and individuals during the Covid-19 outbreak. Through its charity the BFC Foundation (which brings all its charitable initiatives under one umbrella), it’s making £1 million of emergency funds available, “the majority supporting designer businesses and with a portion of funds also allocated to students, underpinning the future generation of creative talent”.

But it’s also beginning a fundraising drive as it knows that £1 million will not be enough.The new fund has been made possible through pooling the BFC talent support grants that would have traditionally been awarded for either early stage showcasing support or business growth and promotion. Clearly, showcasing is off the agenda for now as fashion shows and events are cancelled globally. 

As mentioned, the BFC also said that “while £1 million is a great start, the scale of the need is much greater and [it] has called on both government to step in to work with them on significant industry stimulus, and on the industry and individuals to support the Covid Crisis Fund through donations, so that more businesses can be supported at this time”.

It added that the new fundraising campaign sees it seeking “contributions that will be crucial to the survival of designer businesses led by creative talent who inspire the global industry.
The crisis has seen creative businesses fighting on several fronts. BFC calls for support for liquidity in the form of grants or long-term low risk loans that address retail cancellations and sell-through guarantees and in turn will help businesses address disruption to supply chain[s] and a potential domino effect of failure”.

It’s also asking for rent holidays for offices and stores to further protect employment. 

CEO Caroline Rush said: “Now more than ever, we are committed to support the businesses and people that make up our industry. With the BFC Foundation Covid Crisis Fund and the donations raised, our hope is to support those British businesses that need additional subsidies, beyond government stimulus available, to address their most urgent challenges.”

Applications for a grant from the fund will open within the next seven days and will run until April 10. Applicants should have an established designer fashion business and collections consisting mainly of womenswear, menswear, accessories, millinery or fine jewellery – not bridal or kidswear. Applicants also need to have a company that's UK-based and be registered with Companies House, or a sole trader. It should be majority-owned by the designer/creative director and not have had outside equity funding ""in any material amount"". And the grant money requested should relate to a clear purpose to help the business survive over the next year.

The fund is already being supported by the BFC’s partners, including Arch & Hook, British Vogue, Browns, Burberry, Depop, GQ, JD.com, Label/Mix, Paul Smith, Rodial and Value Retail.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 25, 2020","Smita Paul has been sewing scarves and clothing for her small fashion business since 2003 but ever since the coronavirus struck the Bay Area and created a shortage in personal protective equipment for hospital workers, she has switched from sewing scarves to sewing masks.“We are all horrified. The idea of one of my friends having to go into this situation without having any protective gear, I just can’t imagine,” said Paul. “If we can do one little thing, we’re going to do it.”

Paul is among a growing number eager to answer desperate calls from healthcare workers on social media and community forums asking for assistance in acquiring masks, gloves and other equipment needed to protect them against the pandemic that has killed at least 660 people in the United States and sickened more than 50,000.Craig Enis, 50, works as a registered subacute nurse at Generations Healthcare in Walnut Creek, California. He said the facility is running low on surgical masks, gowns for isolation rooms, and hand sanitizer.

“N95-masks are just nonexistent right now,” he said.

Enis is afraid for himself as a healthcare worker and for his vulnerable patients, but nothing scares him more than possibly bringing home the virus to his two children.

“It’s incredibly scary because I’m a single father, and they have no choice but to be with me, so whatever I come home with, they’re exposed to,” Enis said.

A Google spreadsheet circulating online showed informal requests for almost three dozen medical facilities in the Bay Area, including the University of California San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF), Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Health. Each request described items the facilities would accept and how to deliver them.

With California under a stay-at-home order, Paul rallied volunteer sewers to help. She has posted an instructional video on YouTube, provided kits with materials, and coordinated deliveries.

“We’re all volunteering, and it just shows what a group of concerned citizens can do. We’ll probably get 100 masks out today,” said Paul, whose company, Indigo Handloom, is partnering with community members, including City College of San Francisco’s fashion department, to increase mask production.

Anne Cocquyt, 36, in San Francisco, spent the weekend collecting unused and unopened boxes of N95-masks for nurses at Kaiser. She said she felt compelled to help after hearing reports on social media that nurses were cutting up plastic bottles to use as face shields.

“That’s when we said ‘OK, we need to do something right now,’” Cocquyt said. “This is a drop in the bucket but at the same time this might be one day’s worth of supplies for the nurses in the ER.”

In a statement, Kaiser Permanente said it was working to increase its supply of protective gear as quickly as possible and develop “a process to efficiently collect, inventory, inspect, and distribute these donations.”

UCSF, meanwhile, set up three donation sites that opened on Monday. A statement called the donations critical for frontline employees.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Mar 25, 2020","In early February, as the full force of the Covid-19 epidemic was hitting China, the Shanghai Fashion Week was one of the first events to be postponed, to an indefinite date. It was officially set to begin on March 26, but it then decided to adopt an unprecedented online-only format: from March 24 to 30 it is being broadcast live on Tmall, the leading website of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, as well as on its live-streaming shopping site Taobao Live. A first in the history of fashion.Last week, the organisers published the calendar of the Shanghai Fashion Week (SHFW) for the Fall/Winter 2020-21 season, announcing a programme with over 150 labels and designers from around the world, among them Diane von Furstenberg, and scores of emerging Chinese designers like Yirantian, Shushu/Tong and Angel Chen.

This unusual fashion week will also feature the possibility of buying products on a see-now, buy-now basis. Viewers will be able to “buy some of the items seen on the catwalk shows - and pre-order new looks from the fall collections - in real time via their smartphones,” indicated the organisers in a press release. This will give the opportunity to the labels showing during the week “to present over 1,000 items from their latest collections, and sell their products to the more than 800 million monthly active users on Alibaba’s e-commerce sites.”A way to test a new format and also to help fashion labels, commercially hit by the Covid-19 emergency, find a new clientèle and hike up their sales again on the web.

“China's fashion industry and consumer market have matured in the course of the years and have entered a new era of creative energy and unlimited opportunities,” said Xiaolei Lu, deputy general secretary of the Shanghai Fashion Week, also known as Madame Lu.How the shows are going to be staged is unclearFew details are available on how labels are actually staging their shows, and where. However, Mike Hu, the head of Tmall’s fashion, luxury and fast-moving consumer goods division, underlined how this experience is only possible thanks to present-day technology: “For this edition of the Shanghai Fashion Week we have adopted some of Alibaba’s most advanced technology solutions in order to offer a new, high-quality experience to consumers.”

To stage the event, Tmall has drawn on Alibaba’s store digitalisation savvy, and more besides. Tmall indicated it has integrated into a single high-tech solution a variety of tools, like live streaming, short videos, the DingTalk instant messaging app and the Tmall Flagship 2.0 e-shop technology.

The goal is not to stop here but to carry on, improving Tmall's capabilities also for the other leading fashion weeks, in Paris, Milan, London and New York. To launch their products, “instead of holding a traditional two-hour press conference, labels will be able to interact with consumers over a longer period of time, from teasers and sneak previews to live broadcasting and post-show interviews, reaching an audience of thousands, potentially millions of people rather than a few hundred spectators. This will allow labels to exceed the physical constraints of geography and time in engaging their customers,” said Hu.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 25, 2020","There is nothing like a centenary to focus attention on a brand, especially one on the mend, like Fogal, considered by many as the nec plus ultra of legwear. 
 
Founded by Léon Fogal in 1921 in Zurich, the marque suffered a difficult second decade this century, but is now under a new ownership and management. As a result, it is definitely on the mend.
 In December 2017, Edouard and Margaux Burrus bought control of Fogal, beginning two years of major restructuring that has left the house well-placed for a period of rapid expansion. Precisely at a moment, however, when the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world, and the entire fashion and luxury industry, to a dramatic halt.
 
Nonetheless, once this dark period ends, Fogal would appear to be right-sized for a true renaissance. So, we caught up with the Burrus and their highly-experienced creative director Jean-Luc Amsler for their take on the future revival.“Fogal will be 100 years next year. It’s a marque of true quality, but one that ended up on its heels. But in the past two years we integrated a new IT system, to better control our supplies, production and reach our clients. And we have worked hard on optimizing our products,” explains Edoaurd, the CEO. His wife Margaux is co-chairman and chief communication officer.
 
Fogal products are made between Switzerland and Italy, and are produced in eastern Lombardy, around Castel Goffredo – known as La Città della Calza (which means ""Tights Town"" in Italian). Like all factories in Italy, those plants are currently closed, though Burrus is in talks to modify their current order and help in the production of surgical masks. 
 
“This is not the time to think of competition. This a terrible ordeal for the world and for so many people’s health. Our first goal is of course to guarantee the health of our staff, partners, suppliers and all clients. We personally remain at home, with our children,” explained Edouard in a phone call from Geneva.
 
Switzerland has a less restrictive lockdown than its neighbours France and Italy. 
 
“There is a confinement at home. Yes, it is a little lighter than France. But people are respecting it in that rigorous Swiss manner,” he noted.
 
Fogal remained family-owned until 1968, or six years after Léon Fogal’s death, before it was acquired by Zurich banker Walter Meier. In 2009, it was sold to Gaydoul, and achieved certain popular dazzle when Cary Mulligan wore Fogal in The Great Gatsby. Also, Catherine Martin won the Oscar for costume design for that film in 2013. However, a half decade later, Fogal found itself in serious financial difficulties before Edouard and Margaux stepped in. 
 
Edouard is not unfamiliar with luxury. In 2015, Burrus and financier Philippe Camperio bought Borsalino, the Italian hat manufacturer. But he relinquished his executive position at Borsalino in 2017 to fully concentrate on Fogal. 
 
“Borsalino is taking off again; and I am still an important shareholder. But now I concentrate on Fogal,” said Edouard, who was born in Paris but is Swiss and grew up in Geneva. After studies in Singapore and Boston, at Northeastern University, he completed an MBA back in Paris at business school ESSEC. 
 
Margaux is Paris-born, but grew up in London and studied at the Lycée Français, in Kensington. 
 
“What is important about Fogal is that from its first day, the brand was constructed with the best possible quality.  We want to conserve those fundamentals, but also add new codes, those of 2020. We call it modernizing what is timeless,” explains Margaux.
 
Beside the smarter, revamped image, one can find new packaging – which is made of recyclable cardboard. After bringing on board designer Amsler, they noticeably altered the waistline. Previously, it was sewn in; now it is all done in one knit, making it largely invisible, flatter, wider and more comfortable. 
The medium-term commercial strategy is to return to big department stores, a plan already in the works. Indeed, Fogal retails in Bloomingdale's and Saks in the US, and has a successful space at Tony Fenwick, in London. On the web, Fogal is sold on Luxury Legs and UK Tights, as well as department store sites like Saks. The brand also sells on its website. Plus, it is in talks with other e-tailers for Internet pop-up stores.
 
Currently, they have just one free-standing Fogal boutique in Zurich. The Burrus are also actively searching suitable retail spaces for stand-alone stores in London, New York, Paris and Tokyo. 
 
Fogal began this year selling across 100 sales points worldwide. Its goal is to expand to 500-700 of those within three years, even if coronavirus will slow that progress somewhat. A mixture of poor management decisions and archaic design led to Fogal’s rapid decline in the past decade. Back in 2010, Fogal had annual sales of around €40 million, but by 2017, it had sunk as low as €5 million.
 
Aided by Amsler’s fresher vision and a powered-up website, the new owners believe Fogal can triple its sales within the next two years. After clearing out old stock, the trio took the new designs to New York, impressing buyers with their fresher approach.
 
The global market for legwear is estimated at $51 billion annually, and it’s a market in net progression. Prior to coronavirus, it had been expected to grow to $53 billion as of 2022.
 
“Mass brands had their moment of glory, fast fashion is fading. People realize the negative ecological impact and that is another reason they want to wear tights that last. A pair from Fogal just doesn’t run. Our tights have extraordinary resiliency,” said Edouard, taking a pair in hand and pressing his thumb hard into the mesh - without breaking through.
 
Somewhat curiously, Margaux sees Fogal’s main competitors as jeans. 
 
“In terms of marketing, jeans are our competitors. A 35-40-year old woman often wears jeans and boots. Jeans cover a woman’s legs. But she still wears skirts with tights. What we want to do is accompany women in their lives, comfortably, with shapewear, if they have an extra kilo or two. We all do, really. Fogal is truly a legwear brand. Not just tights,” she insists.
 
Fogal has also been active in co-branding; partly for strategic reasons, partly for reasons of savoir-faire.
 
Like, for instance, with Sigvaris: Fogal has been working with the Swiss medical brand to create a new socks line that feature special colours designed for people with hypertension, those who travel and those who stand all day at work.
 
Fogal also linked up with Dries Van Noten for one of its shows. The former produced a capsule collection of opaque, multiple-coloured tights, sold for Fall/Winter 2019. The capsule was defined as Dries Van Noten by Fogal. Plus, Swarovski crystal-studded tights are in the pipeline for Fogal's 100th anniversary.
 
“We want a noble product, and we’d like to democratise legwear. We don’t sell for 5 euros, of course. Fogal had been for many years the reference in tights, but sadly that has faded. We want to see that phenomenon again internationally,” said Margaux. Machine-washable Fogal tights are priced at €39.90 – not unreasonable seeing as they can last a decade.
 
The duo hired Amsler after feeling a complementarity with him in terms of vision and taste. A noted creator in his own right, Amsler has done stints with designers of the caliber of Yves Saint Laurent, Thierry Mugler and Courrèges. He was also a creative at Smalto, and launched his own label in the '90s.

“I have always believed that tights are an integrated part of fashion. You can make the most beautiful dress in the world, but if the tights are wrong, that takes away a lot of the effect,” Amsler argues.
 
“Plus, I am Swiss, and this was a chance to go back home and concentrate on a Swiss brand,” he adds.
 
“We want to operate in the terrain of the myth. How a woman expresses herself, meaning not just as an object of seduction. We want her to emancipate herself and be on trend,” adds Amsler, who has even added houndstooth and Prince of Wales-print tights.
 
Innate entrepreneurs, the Burrus are deeply committed to Fogal. They haven’t taken a vacation since the summer of 2018, for their daughter's first birthday.
 
“We have a small team to relaunch a great brand. So, we see everything, and meet everyone, and do everything. Except when we wake up with our kids and when we dine with our kids. Otherwise, we are working. When we finish eating, we pull out our laptops and start working again,” smiles Edouard, hardworking as, well, a pair of Fogal tights.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 24, 2020","As of March 24, the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund has been repurposed into a new Covid-19 relief fund. Named 'A Common Thread,' it will support members of the American fashion community who have been impacted by the outbreak.With the support of Anna Wintour and chairman of the CFDA, Tom Ford, the two fashion powerhouses have repurposed the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund into a new Covid-19 relief fund, named 'A Common Thread,' as of March 24. 

Applications will be available through the CFDA website starting April 8, and the fund is not limited to former Fashion Fund participants or members of the CFDA. Those who are interested in donating to the fund can do so by texting 'thread' to 44-321, or by making a contribution online. 

""One of the worst feelings a crisis like this one can inspire is helplessness,"" Wintour said in a message posted to Vogue.com. 

""And there is so much help that is needed, especially as small businesses and workers across this country suffer devastating economic consequences.

""Among those already affected are those in the fashion community, from designers to their employees and retail workers up and down the economic scale. There are inspiring stories of designers making masks and medical supplies, but I have also been hearing from those who fear they won’t make payroll, or who have seen orders returned, their stores closed, who fear their businesses and their livelihoods may not survive what we’re going through. And all of us at Vogue—together with the Council of Fashion Designers of America—are determined to help.""

To boost the initiative, the CFDA and Vogue will launch a video series on March 25, featuring the stories of those in the fashion industry whose businesses and livelihoods have been affected by the pandemic and its economic impact. 

""The videos will highlight not only designers, but those who work tirelessly behind the scenes in the country’s incredibly strong and vibrant fashion industry, and they will live on both Vogue and CFDA digital platforms,"" the CFDA said.  

Throughout their longterm partnership, Vogue and the CFDA have come together multiple times to provide assistance during times of crisis. In the 90s, the two held the 7th on Sale fundraiser to help raise money to fight HIV/AIDS, while the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund was first launched after 9/11 to support new and emerging American fashion designers.

"Mar 17, 2020","Chanel has called off its May cruise show in Capri, making it the last major fashion house to annul a resort runway show planned for this spring.Given worldwide concerns about the coronavirus, Chanel’s decision had been widely expected. With both Italy and France, the latter since Tuesday noon, in full lockdown, the house had effectively little other choice. Nonetheless, given Chanel’s reputation as the largest single luxury fashion brand on the planet, the news is latest significant mark of the huge impact of coronavirus on the luxury industry worldwide.
 
Chanel’s resort collection show had been scheduled for May 7, 2020 on the beautiful island in the Bay of Naples, which has been an elegant resort since the time of the ancient Roman Republic two millennia ago.“Our foremost consideration is the health and well-being of our teams and guests. Chanel is examining alternative ways of presenting its collection in Capri at a later date and in a different format,” the house informed FashionNetwork.com in a statement.
 
Chronologically, Chanel’s cruise show was the last on a series of some half-dozen cruise collections by major runway marques due to be staged in exotic locations between April and May this year. Among the other major houses who have all cancelled resort runway shows in the next eight weeks are Christian Dior, Prada, Gucci, Max Mara, Giorgio Armani and Versace.
 
“Chanel is closely monitoring the evolution of the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic in order to ensure the protection of all its teams as well as its partners and customers around the world, and has put in place all the necessary preventive measures in accordance with the recommendations of local and global health authorities. This situation, which is quickly evolving, requires a precise approach that takes into account local regulations, and Chanel is fully committed to protect each employee and partner everywhere the company operates,” the house added in a release.
 
In a related move, Chanel had quietly shelved a replica show of its Métiers d’art collection, which was originally shown in Paris last December. It was due to be staged to clients and senior editors on June 4 in London.

"Mar 17, 2020","The Festival d’Hyères has been postponed until the second half of October, or the latest major fashion event called off due to coronavirus. “We had no other choice, because nobody was at all sure that we could travel anywhere in April,” explained Jean-Pierre Blanc, the general director of the Festival d’Hyères.
 
The festival is considered by most as leading on the international fashion scene for discovering raw, young talent fresh out of college. Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson, founder of the JW Anderson label and creative director of Loewe, had been chosen to chair the fashion competition’s jury at the 35th edition of the Hyères International Festival. It had initially been scheduled for April 25-29, 2020.
 
Star model Kaia Gerber was also named a jury member, together with Olivier Lalanne, editor-in-chief of Vogue Hommes International and Olivier Gabet, director of the Decorative Arts museum in Paris.
 
“For sure, the Festival will still take place in the second half of October, and we plan to have a super event when it does,” insisted Blanc, who founded the festival back in 1985.
 
The postponement follows in the wake of multiple other deferments or cancellations of major cruise shows this spring by global fashion brands – Dior, Chanel, Max Mara, Prada, Gucci and Versace - and the suspension of fashion weeks in Sydney, Beijing, Shanghai and Sao Paulo, due to fears over the spread of coronavirus.
 
The festival is held at the Villa Noailles, a famed villa and temple of Modernist architecture overlooking the city of Hyères, a charming resort on the south coast of France that first became chic in the late 19th century. The villa often houses exhibitions, showrooms, meetings and workshops that are open to the general public. As for the festival, it also awards prizes for photography as well as fashion accessories.
 
Past winners in the fashion category  have included Belgian designer Anthony Vaccarello, creative director of Saint Laurent, Dutch duo Viktor & Rolf and one of the two behind Rushemy Botter: Lisi Herrebrugh. The design duo was later appointed as creative directors of French label Nina Ricci.
 
Over the years, fashion jury chairs have included John Galliano, Dries Van Noten, Azzedine Alaia, Christian Lacroix, Riccardo Tisci, Dries Van Noten and Yohji Yamamoto.

Blanc added that organizers still planned to go ahead with the ""Design Parade Hyères"", which will be held from June 25 to 28 exclusively for professionals, before opening to the public until the end of August.
 
“Right now, we fully intend to maintain the dates of the ""Design"" festival,” Blanc stressed.

"Mar 17, 2020","Johnny Coca has left his position as creative director of Mulberry, the British fashion and accessories house, as announced on Tuesday.The Spanish-born and multi-lingual designer will leave Mulberry at the end of March, some five years after taking up his position at the house. He initially joined Mulberry after a highly successful stint at Celine – under then-creative director Phoebe Philo – after working with Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton.
 
Coca’s tenure coincided with a period of international expansion at the British house. His nomination saw Mulberry launch such iconic bags as the Amberley and the Iris; as well as develop tremendously both the brand's eyewear and sneaker categories. Also, he achieved in re-launching Mulberry's men’s accessories and jewelry ranges.“I have loved my time with this iconic, British heritage brand and would like to thank the amazing teams and everyone who has supported me during my time here. I am proud of everything we have achieved and the collections we have created. The passion and dedication I have seen at Mulberry has been incredible and I am honored to have been part of the brand’s history,” said Coca in a release. 
 
During Coca’s tenure, Mulberry staged a series of consumer events in the UK, Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe and Australia as part of the brand’s international expansion. 
 
“Coca’s last collection for the brand will be Spring Summer 2021 and Mulberry has begun the process of finding a successor,” Mulberry noted in the release.

Coca’s last event for Mulberry was a three-day program of events at its New Bond Street store, during London Fashion Week in February. One segment, entitled Made to Last, invited customers to immerse themselves in the world of the luxury handbag manufacturer with experiential initiatives.  The house even “transported” its Somerset factory to London, allowing guests to see how its new 100% sustainable leather Portobello Tote was created by its craftspeople. Coca, who was known for favoring kilts in his general attire, led on to a series of talks on creativity and sustainability with guests.The affable and popular Coca garnered generally positive reviews for his Mulberry fashion collections. They tended to blend historicism – from British Tudor to English country house gentility – with 'It-gal' sass and a punk attitude.
 
“I would like to thank Johnny for everything he has contributed to the brand over the past five years. Johnny’s creative vision has been a key element in delivering our strategy to develop Mulberry as an international lifestyle brand,” Mulberry CEO Thierry Andretta added.
 
“As we head towards our 50th anniversary in 2021, we continue to focus on our strategy to build Mulberry as a global luxury brand. We remain committed to developing responsible, innovative products, underpinned by a strong in-house creative team and our international direct-to-consumer omni-channel business model,” the CEO said.  
 
That said, even though it is one of the UK’s most famous marques, noted for its British aesthetic and value for money products, Mulberry has had difficulty in the past gaining traction in its drive as to reinvent itself as a true international prestige marque. As a result, Mulberry has struggled to become truly profitable, and its share price has nosedived from a high of 1,132.50p in September 2016 to 147p today, as seen this morning on the London Stock Exchange.
 
In February, British retail investor Mike Ashley bought a 12.5% stake in Mulberry via his department store chain House of Fraser, which included the brand amongst its retail offerings for many years. 
 
In its most recent results, Mulberry suffered a 2% decline in global sales, ending up at £166 million as of the end of March 2019; and endured a £5 million loss.

The show had originally been scheduled to be staged on May 9 in Lecce, an ancient city in Puglia (the region that forms the heel of the Italian peninsula). Not only that, but two days before, on May 7, Chanel is also scheduled to hold a cruise runway show in Capri.

"Mar 13, 2020","Models strutted the ramp with adhesive glittering rhinestones stuck around their mouths arranged in the shape of surgical face masks as the coronavirus pandemic took centre stage at a fashion week in Cape Town.Veteran South African designer Gavin Rajah on Thursday night used the stage at the African International Fashion Week in Cape Town, to highlight to the division and potential racism that protective surgical masks may spur.

Models also donned plastic sheets covering their heads and face, mimicking the protective hazmat suits usually worn by medics working in infectious diseases hospitals.""The use of the mask is very kind of symbolic because the mask isn't really about necessarily protecting you, but what its going to do, is alienate you from the rest of the people around you,"" Rajah told AFP.

""It's going to set you apart. It's a new form of racism"".

Since the deadly outbreak of the virus - known officially as COVID-19 -- originated in China in December, Asian communities around the world have been subjected to suspicion and fear.

""We're trying to create a form of expression and turn something which is negative into a form of something which is beautiful,"" said Rajah.

In the world's fashion hub of Italy, which is one the hardest hit countries, Chinese tourists have reportedly been spat at in Venice and mothers in Milan have used social media to call for children to be kept away from Chinese classmates.

In Malaysia, a petition to ""bar Chinese people from entering our beloved country"" received almost 500,000 signatures in one week.

Rajah, who is celebrating 20 years in the fashion industry said he didn't want to leave a legacy only of only pretty dresses.

""We want to acknowledge the humanity in the people next to us and around us. And we want to champion those rights,"" he said.

"Mar 12, 2020","As was expected given the worldwide spread of the Covid-19 epidemic, the turnout of fashion industry professionals - between buyers and journalists - at the Paris Fashion Week from February 24 to March 3 has surely been one of the lowest in years. Despite the fact that Paris already experienced a downturn in visitors in the months that followed the terrorist attacks of November 2015.

The French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation (FHCM), the body that runs the Paris Fashion Week’s official calendar, forecast that “one third of visitors would be absent, with approximately 5,000 people attending” the event’s February-March 2020 edition. This was a mere estimate, since FHCM said it is “in charge of journalists’ accreditation, but has no figures for actual attendance,” and underlined, unsurprisingly, that “considering the travel ban, China is the Fashion Week's main absentee.” Nevertheless, the Parisian catwalk shows’ appeal is such that there was no empty-seat effect, with always plenty of people keen to see the shows.Contacted by FashionNetwork.com, Chanel said it observed “a slight decrease in the presence of journalists, especially those from the regions most affected [by the epidemic] at the time, like Asia and Italy. We observed the same in terms of our buyers’ presence. Buyers from certain areas decided to travel in smaller numbers, or to be represented by members of their staff already present in France.”

At first, only the Chinese visitors’ contingent was expected to be impacted, but the acceleration in the epidemic's spread a few days ahead of the start of the Paris Fashion Week raised the level of concern, and international attendance in a broader sense slumped. Some American buyers in particular decided to return to the USA as a precaution, just as the Fashion Week opened.Visitors in Paris down by a third during Fashion WeekCatwalk shows by leading labels are the industry’s showcase, and if they struggle, the entire sector working behind the scenes starts to slow down. The trade shows scheduled in Paris during the Fashion Week, from February 28 to March 2, were also directly affected by the decline in visitors to the city. The three main trade events, Première Classe, Tranoï and Woman, all experienced a downturn in attendance. Everyone thinks it was inevitable.

WSN, organiser of the Première Classe show at the Tuileries Gardens, recorded a fall in visitor numbers very similar to the figure mentioned by FHCM, posting a 32.63% decline. It was felt mostly among buyers from Japan, Italy, the USA and China, in this order, according to WSN figures. Unsurprisingly, China was out of the top 10 in the visitor ranking by country for this edition. France was impacted less, and its visitors accounted for 48% of the total.

While well aware of the difficulties caused to exhibitors, WSN nevertheless reckoned it “avoided a disaster,” according to Frédéric Maus, managing director of WSN. “Clearly there were far fewer visitors, but representatives of the leading purchasing departments did attend, as well as other key buyers, even though they often travelled alone and not with their staff,” he added. The organisers of Première Classe underlined the solidarity shown by the industry as a whole, which mobilised to keep the show on the road, despite the bleak outlook. Première Classe is also hoping to make up at least partially for this season’s visitor shortfall by deploying its newsletters and social media activity more extensively, affording greater visibility to exhibitors.

Among the buyers present, even those who did place some orders were very circumspect. “No one is currently taking any risks, seeing the economic situation,” said the senior executive of a Tranoï exhibitor. Some are also wondering, for example, about the wisdom of doing business with brands whose products are made entirely in China.

A reluctance regarded as a “double blow” by Boris Provost, the newly appointed director of Tranoï, who also admitted attendance was down, without giving any figures: “A miracle didn't materialise, and this uncertainty is highly frustrating, at a time when we would like to move forward, assess the results of our new initiatives; these aren't the ideal conditions for making progress,” he said. But trade shows aren’t the only ones under pressure.Some labels are thinking about prolonging their sales campaigns until the end of March, in order to canvass absent buyers extensively using online tools. Antoine Floch, one of the organisers of the Woman trade show, which reported an attendance shortfall of about 20% for its March session, is worried about the seasonal calendar’s displacement: “How will production be able to begin in the coming weeks, if labels haven’t closed their sales campaigns by then, and are trying to make up for lost ground? And how will Chinese and Italian factories and workshops have been affected? It would be disastrous if delivery delays were to compound this season’s shrinking order volumes.”If you won’t come to the Fashion Week, the Fashion Week will come to youTo avoid losing touch with absent buyers, especially those from Asia, labels are making a much greater use of digital tools. “Purchases are made remotely, via live streaming, video calls and by sending pictures. Swatch books with fabric samples have also been shipped out to various markets, so that [buyers] are able to feel the fabrics, making remote selling easier,” said Chanel.

LVMH indicated that “catwalk shows have been broadcast on the web, as the group's labels have run mini-programmes on Chinese social media. These broadcasts have been a genuine success. For example, Celine said it reached an audience of over 800,000 people with its live-streamed show, despite the late hour in Asia, and 1.2 million people when the show was re-broadcast last week-end.”

Louis Vuitton “addressed several messages of support and sympathy to the Chinese people, asking its local brand ambassadors to record messages that were broadcast ahead of the show.” At Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri herself recorded a speech that was broadcast live before the start of the show.

Given the circumstances, FHCM offered to support labels with less social media clout by helping them reach leading Chinese platforms like Weibo and Douyin, on which the French organisation gave “advance notice of its opening plans on Chinese networks.”

A few days before, the Milan Fashion Week had pioneered this approach. The Italian Fashion Chamber launched the ‘China We Are with You’ initiative, supported by all the leading Italian labels, and broadcast 29 catwalk shows live on Tencent, watched by an audience of 16 million according to the organisers, and also posted extensively on Weibo.

Gucci, as well as joining the initiative, made its own arrangements for its Milanese show: “In addition to broadcasting the show live on our websites and on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Weibo, we deployed a digital showroom experience, with the possibility of accessing 360º views of the various garments, of zooming in on specific details and buying the items in question, all using the same tool.”Epidemic a factor in accelerating Fashion Week digitalisation?Undoubtedly, digital tools have been an alternative solution for many other labels, besides leading luxury names, that have been caught short by the situation. Many of them have opted in recent seasons for a parallel presence on digital showrooms as an alternative to featuring on brick-and-mortar ones, also to cut down on staff travel and sample shipments. This season, this proved to be a winner.

“In the last two to three weeks, we noticed a significant rise in contacts by labels that are coming to us to find ways of carrying on with their business regardless,” said Ambre Pellegrino, sales director France and Benelux for Joor, a US B2B marketplace representing several thousand brands. “Recent events have pushed digital B2B tools top of the list for many,” she added.“Our figures show an increase in the number of orders placed compared to last year. It seems likely that buyers are turning to labels equipped with remote order-placement tools. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it a real windfall,” said Romain Blanco-Espuny, CEO of French B2B marketplace Le New Black.

The current situation is forcing industry operators to modify their business practices. Extending the sales campaign is an important element, but sourcing issues seem also to be coming to the fore. “This situation might be the chance for some to stand out,” said Pierre Sapin, in charge of Europe at Born, a French networking website for fashion labels and retailers.

“Small and medium-sized labels do not generally source from China, but more locally. Smaller labels might become much more attractive if they focus their narrative on their history and production processes. Nowadays, saying ‘I have no problems with production’ has become a strong argument,” he added.

"Mar 11, 2020","Max Mara has called off its planned cruise catwalk show, scheduled for May 25 in Saint Petersburg, in the latest cancellation of a resort runway show by a major fashion house.The fashion house, based in Reggio Emilia, acted after Italy went into lockdown on the whole peninsula on Monday, as the country fights to gain control of the coronavirus pandemic. Max Mara took the decision as a logical precautionary move, the house stressed.

Max Mara joins a list of major Italian fashion marques that have called off cruise shows scheduled for this spring: Gucci and Versace in the United States; Prada in Japan and Giorgio Armani in Dubai.That said, major French houses have for the moment maintained plans to stage cruise shows: Christian Dior in Lecce; and Chanel on the island of Capri. Alberta Ferretti is also still scheduled to stage a resort show in Rimini on May 22.

For the past several years, the top 10 fashion brands have staged major cruise runway shows in exotic locations, designed to capture major mainstream and social media coverage whilst burnishing each house’s creative reputation. Last year, Max Mara made its entry within said top 10 group with a critically acclaimed show in Berlin in May.

Italy is the country that was the worst hit by coronavirus after China, and the Italian government has accused the European Union and several other member countries of lacking solidarity in bringing aid for the pandemic.

Both Germany and France have imposed limits on the exports of protective medical equipment. China, however, has reportedly offered to sell to Italy 1,000 lung ventilators; two million face masks; 20,000 protective suits; and 50,000 swabs for coronavirus.

"Mar 10, 2020","Amid cancellations of fashion events due to the coronavirus outbreak, ModaLisboa returned for another season last week. Now in its 54th edition, the event was held at Oficinas Gerais de Fardamento e Equipamento on 5-8 March, celebrating local fashion with a total of 20 runway shows. This season saw the debut of United Fashion, which supports emerging designers, as Lisbon Fashion Week continues its push towards strengthening its position on the global stage.
 “The fashion system is continuously changing and we know that, as a fashion week, we need to change with it. We need to do more than just showcasing next season’s collections. For events of this size, it is now mandatory to embrace a culture of cultural, social and educational responsibility,” said Eduarda Abbondanza, president of ModaLisboa. “We have striven to build an inclusive and responsible event that matches the rhythm of our city.” As a result, ModaLisboa has aligned itself with various sustainable initiatives taking place across the city. “The future is in our hands and every day begins with a search for answers to the question: how can the fashion industry slow down without impacting growth?

With the aim of driving change, on 5 March, ModaLisboa hosted Fast Talks, a conversation about reinventing the fashion system and integrating sustainability in every step of the process. Moderated by Patricia Bernabe, the ‘Wake Up’ panel talk took place in the city hall, with Positive Luxury founder Diana Verde Nieto, German fashion expert Lisa Lang and Zazi designer Jeanne de Kroon among the speakers. While Diana Verde Nieto spoke about the luxury industry’s role as a force for change, Lisa Lang said technology will be key to drive a responsible future. “Designers need to learn and master different kinds of technologies to be able to introduce new models,” said the founder of innovation agency ThePowerHouse, while Jeanne de Kroon, a EU ambassador for sustainable fashion, asserted that sustainability is a label that sells. “We shouldn't talk so much about whether something is sustainable; we should focus on whether it was produced ethically,” she said, adding that “every piece in our closet has a story. Narrative is more important than fashion.”A European futureOn the same evening, Lisbon held the United Fashion event, a platform co-founded by the European Union’s Creative Europe programme. Dedicated to supporting and nurturing emerging design in Europe, the project is in partnership with 16 institutions such as ACME, Fédération Française du Prêt-à-Porter Féminin, the Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography and the Centre for Fashion Enterprise in the UK. The four-year programme is coming to an end in the summer of 2021, after giving more than 150 participating fashion businesses the opportunity to have a presence at various industry events, such as 48h Maisons de Mode -- Lille, Berlin Fashion Week, Fashion Weekend Skopje, Riga Fashion Week and Fashion Talks Antwerp.
 In Lisbon, United Fashion hosted a fashion exhibition featuring 15 designers, as well as a pop-up showroom at Campo de Santa Clara, where a number of collections were presented to the press and international buyers from the likes of Printemps, Paris-based Tom Greyhound and London’s Machine-A. “Consumers are increasingly looking for more exclusive and unique pieces, and we can only find these items in independent brands,” said a group of British buyers.

The event was attended by brands and designers from Germany, including Schmidt Takahashi and Dawid Tomaszewski; Belgian names such as Lina Maria, Sarah Saint Hubert, Snobe and Toos Franken; Latvians like Talented Company and One Wolf; France’s Voir (e);  Sweden’s Sofija Utumovic; and Archie Dickens, Opiar and Béhen from Portugal. The latter was a standout at United Fashion, thanks to its experimental looks made from recycled fabrics, fruits and vegetables. “We believe that the growth of the independent fashion industry in Europe is only possible with a united action plan. Tomorrow will be for those who build their identity without ever losing the courage to innovate,” said Eduarda Abbondanza.Young designers, sustainable collectionsThe schedule of runway shows started with a presentation from Sangue Novo. Inês Manuel Baptista was honoured with the Polimoda award to take part in an MA in fashion design at Polimoda, Francisco Pereira received the Tintex award and Cêlá took home the Fleeting Room award. Pereira will create a capsule collection in collaboration with Tintex Textiles and Cêlá will have the opportunity to sell the winning collection at the retailer’s store. Meanwhile, designer Carolina Machado presented Grounded, a timeless collection that encapsulates our connection with the earth, where pastel shades gave form to crop tops and oversized silhouettes.It was not the only outstanding collection. Constança Entrudo continued to explore the concept of identity in neon tones, while Gonçalo Peixoto took a more commercial approach with an Instagram-friendly collection filled with mini dresses, ruffles and metallic blazers. Awaytomars drew inspiration from black holes for its latest range. In terms of established designers, Luis Carvalho was inspired by artists in a collection of structured crepe numbers and layers of tulle. And Luís Buchinho, supported by Portugal Fashion, celebrated the 30th anniversary of his brand with a line of faux leather pieces.

Finally, Dutch brand Ninamounah helped elevate the event’s international credentials on the last day of ModaLisboa. The brand, a staple at Amsterdam Fashion Week, was founded by Ninamounah Langestraat, who presented a series of tailored pieces made locally and sustainably. It was the perfect way to epitomise ModaLisboa’s message of sustainability and international collaboration.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 6, 2020","The womenswear show marathon in the world's fashion capitals, which began on February 3 and ended on Tuesday March 3, has left an odd impression of unfinished business, of issues unresolved. The reflections prompted by fashion designers in New York, London, Milan and Paris with their Fall/Winter 2020-21 ready-to-wear collections are deeply affecting. Beginning with the issue of inclusion.

This season, like never before, the models featured on the catwalks have been hugely diverse in terms of sex, nationality, age and morphology. At the same time, many designers, in their quest for meaning, have drawn on the past to better understand today’s world, even opening up to religion. As a result, next winter’s looks are veering increasingly towards the understated, with minimalist, monochrome outfits that nevertheless don't shy away from flaunting a few flamboyant features. The main trends that emerged from the last few seasons are still going strong, from fringes to capes, all-leather looks, menswear fabrics, lingerie, checks and more. But other trends are surfacing. Women, like fashion designers, are prone to self-questioning, hovering between adult empowerment and carefree childhood.1) Period dresses The spirit of the distant past has been powerfully resurrected on the catwalks, from Louis Vuitton's collection, a journey back in time to the 15th century, to medieval chatelaine dresses, to long, high-collared overcoats and cloaks covering the body head to foot, seen among others at Balenciaga and Marine Serre, the pannier dresses referenced and refreshed by Ann Demeulemeester, not to mention the crinolines seen at Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Moschino. Throwbacks to period costumes cropped up in several collections, like Chanel's musketeer boots or the doublets seen on some catwalks.
 2) Mantelets  In the same vein, mantelets are back in fashion, in the form of short mini-capes covering the shoulders and arms. They can be worn over dresses, as in bygone days, and also over coats and other types of jackets. They are made of wool (Jil Sander), of nylon and leather (Nina Ricci), of silvery fabric (Vivienne Westwood and Paco Rabanne), of lace (Pucci), or feature a longer cape-like back (Givenchy). 3) Religious clothes and accessories  In these soul-searching times, several designers seem to have transposed their yearning for spirituality into their collections, resorting to a religious register with Christian overtones. Like the ample cassock-style dresses, the best examples those by Balenciaga. The same theme inspired the white liturgical lace decorating some dresses by Paco Rabanne, and the crosses glimpsed at Chanel, Gucci and Philipp Plein. And the mantillas, the lace scarves worn by Catholic women, sometimes exaggerated to cover the head and shoulders like those of Madonnas and saints, by Comme des Garçons, Simone Rocha and Richard Quinn.
 
 4) Maxi shoulders  The accent is on shoulders, with masculine jackets featured in every collection. The shoulder lines are sculptured 1980s-style (at Balmain, Saint Laurent and Isabel Marant), and the shoulders broaden, inflate and taper, or are hugely exaggerated, for example by Balenciaga and Rick Owens.
 
 5) Balloon sleeves  For next winter, designers are paying a very special attention to arms, covering them and inflating them with volume, emphasizing them like never before. Like shoulders, sleeves too become voluminous. They burgeon into airy shapes, rounded like balloons or flared pagoda-style. A phenomenon affecting all kinds of garments, from dresses to jackets, knitwear and coats.
 6) Ties  Ties are making a noticeable come-back, as women cheerfully continue to rummage through men's wardrobes for their own outfits. Men’s-style suits and jackets, often in generously sized monochrome versions, are particularly ubiquitous. The tie, the men's accessory par excellence, is an another must for next winter, as shown by Dior, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Daks, Prada, Moohong, Rokh, Versace and others.
  7) Knitwear A tidal wave of knitwear has been surging through womenswear collections, driven by a keen appetite for natural fabrics, especially wool. Cable-knit sweaters will play a starring role in next winter’s wardrobes, and knitted dresses are back centre-stage. Worth mentioning, the ‘yarn ball’ dress by Noir Kei Ninomiya.
 8) PatchingThe world is increasingly eclectic, and clothes have become easy to disassemble and put back again. They also feature plenty of slits, allowing glimpses of bare skin on the torso, the back, the side and legs. This season, designers seem to be really enjoying this game, slicing up and patching back together their garments everywhere, and mending these ‘cuts’ with all kinds of very visible stitching: thick woollen threads at Marni, stapling at Versace, metal rings at Sacai, and black laces on an orange knitted dress at Cristiano Burani.
 9) Doll dresses  Women are being portrayed as strong and powerful. But they also want to have fun and, why not, return to their childhood. Several designers have ventured down this road, presenting demure young women’s outfits featuring high socks and white schoolgirl collars, or fully fledged doll dresses, as did Marco De Vincenzo, MSGM, Fendi, Gucci and a few others.
 10) Jewellery While fashion seems to be inclined towards pared-down and often minimalistic looks, silhouettes are nevertheless enhanced by statement jewellery, glittering on ears and necks. And elsewhere too. Chains and long pearl pendants snake around the body, even worn diagonally from the neck to the armpit, and they also decorate other accessories, like shoes, gloves and handbags.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 5, 2020","More luxury houses are postponing fashion shows around the world due to the coronavirus outbreak that has now spread to dozens of countries.Italian brands Giorgio Armani and Versace said on Thursday they were putting off fashion shows for their Cruise collections. The Armani show had been scheduled for April 19-20 in Dubai, while Versace was due to present its collection in the United States on May 16.

Gucci, part of French group Kering has cancelled plans to host its Cruise 2021 fashion show in San Francisco on May 18, while last month Prada and Chanel postponed shows that had been due to take place in Asia in May.“The decision has been taken as a precautionary measure in order to protect all the industry stakeholders, employees and guests who would be involved in the trip”, Armani Group said in a statement.

Versace, which is owned by U.S. group Capri Holdings, said it was “aware of the need to give priority to the health and safety of its guests and employees,” adding further details would be provided as soon as possible.
Cruise collections are fashion shows hosted outside the usual fashion week calendar which are still an important opportunity for luxury brands to showcase their latest designs.

A Gucci spokesman also said on Thursday the new timing and location of its show would be announced once the situation becomes clearer.

Armani said its event would now take place in November, to coincide with Dubai’s Expo 2020, and will no longer be a Cruise collection.

Giorgio Armani held his Milan fashion show behind closed doors last month.

"Mar 5, 2020","It’s been a very particular fashion season, one which began with New York bereft of its four most famous guys – Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Tom Ford – and by almost the entire Chinese community – editors, influencers, buyers and designers. And – in the emptiest season in memory in terms of celebrities and star watching - ended under the shadow of Covid-19. Where, after the final push to complete in Paris the 33 days of over 300 shows one could only breathe a huge sign of relief. Another vitally feminist season, where the month began in New York, where the main news item was the trial for rape of Harvey Weinstein. New reports of that trial often appearing in newspaper pages beside reviews of the American shows.
 
That said, there were some magnificent clothes on display, and some pretty breathtaking shows. In terms of staging and spectacle fashion again delivered the goods with some remarkable performances and displays. So, here’s our take, chronologically, of the 20 best from New York, London, Milan and Paris.Brandon Maxwell
From screen-goddess columns and power-shouldered wrap jackets to high-tech tortoise city coats for girls, and movie-star-at-ease-on-the-weekend suits and pea-coats for guys, no one makes American sportswear look more glamorous than Texan-born Brandon Maxwell. Plus, his staging of the first important show of the season inside the Hall of North American Mammals, where models marched passed giant Klondike bears, cougars or moose, within the Museum of Natural History, was flawless. The sooner someone gives this 35-year-old the reins of a European couture house the better.
 Carolina Herrera
Classic and classy modernism at Carolina Herrera, staged inside the 200-foot-high, retractable wall of The Shed in Hudson Yards. Marvelous Maid Marian floor-length dresses; precision-cut capes; or a series of dreamy dress shapes - column, princess, empire and ball gown. America’s most patrician brand looks safe in the hands of designer Wes Gordon.Proenza Schouler
A brilliant return to form for the duo of Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough with streamlined silhouettes, sleek tailoring and flattering volumes. Ideally draped heavy crepe dresses hanging off the shoulder; double breasted oversized boyfriend blazers or white knit cocktails with mutton-chop sleeves that recalled statues by Brancusi. Sculptural chic on the Hudson River at its best.Preen
Preen’s homage to the psychological occult thriller Don’t Look Now, about a couple searching for their dead child in Venice, resulted in a sensational collection from the checked jackets worn by Donald Sutherland to the gilded costumes of Venetian nobility. Cutting with gusto, the Preen duo of Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi, concocted black ruffle dresses worthy a Grand Canal ball; while combinations of golden vestments and Argyle sweaters were achingly beautiful.
 JW Anderson
The only designer to get two entries in our Top 20 is Jonathan Anderson, whose latest collection for his own house, JW Anderson, was the UK’s stand-out fashion moment. In a season dominated by volume, his collection was the most voluminous – humongous coats with 24-inch lapels; spherical dresses made of antique celluloid or modular '20s frocks with subtle puff shoulders. Not perhaps the most easily digestible or commercial clobber, but as a fashion expression this was the most exhilarating anywhere.
 Burberry
Riccardo Tisci’s turnaround of the troubled UK fashion liner Burberry may be taking a little time, but in the process he is creating a special array of beautiful products. And staging London’s best show. The Italian built a 100-yard-long mirrored catwalk in Olympia, in the middle of which the famed Labèque sisters performed on two opposite-facing Steinways. And on top of which, the fanciest cast anywhere displayed Ricki’s multiple take on the trench – with faux-fur sleeves; or cut like a duster or trimmed with matelassé leather. An unlikely blend of India and Bethnal Green, where he lived as student two decades ago, his meeting of Madras checks and revamped rugby sweaters for guys ended with a silvery mod maharani that was outstanding.
 Jil Sander
Somewhat unnervingly for many guests, the Jil Sander show on the opening night of Milan was held in the city’s version of Chinatown, inside a huge former electrical plant. However, everyone visibly relaxed on witnessing this Sander collection, whose flowing shapes, pristine fabrics and graceful silhouettes made for a moment of grace and civility. The entire cast of 54 eventually sitting down on two lines of wooden office chairs to immense applause. Few of us realizing how the Italian season would end in a mini panic four days later.
 Max Mara
Few designers are having as much of impact as designer Ian Griffiths has achieved at Max Mara. This season he referenced the '80s with plenty of power-shouldered looks, exactly on trend with the posh empowerment mood of many collections. Yet also a tender vision of fashion, referencing the sea and maritime shapes. Like marvelous officer’s great coats; generously draped cashmere duffels or foul weather jackets with tassels. Captain Ahab on Kaia Gerber. 
 Prada
Formidable females at Prada, shown in the Fondazione Prada before a De Chirico-worthy statue of Atlas, three days before Miuccia rather stunned the fashion world by announcing that after April 1, she and Raf Simons would be co-creative directors of Italy’s single most influential fashion marque. For her last solo Prada show, Miuccia subverted multiple female fashion clichés – like floral prints, sheer tops and career blazers – by combining them in unexpected alliances. Hence, perfectly cut and belted one-button blazers paired with calf-length skirts entirely made entirely of fringes; or dapper redingotes worn over knee-length skirts slit well up the thigh. The collection was so good, most editors would note when the Raf news was announced, Prada’s emaciated growth in recent years is surely more due to marketing and merchandising than the actual product. There was absolutely nothing wrong with this latest Prada collection, indeed it was on many people’s shortlist of top five anywhere. 
 Fendi
A sensational Grand Guignol show from Fendi, in the best ever collection by Silvia Venturini Fendi for the house. One year after the departure of the great Karl Lagerfeld, Silvia is truly coming into her own as a powerful voice in fashion. With creations like the undulating runway in monochrome pinks, with dashes of gray, this was a triumphant display of opulent fashion. Military coats with enveloping shapes; armadillo sleeves; cocoon-shaped cashmere cabans and burnished leather ensembles. All worn by a superstar cast – from Bella and Gigi Hadid to Mariacarla Boscono – who clearly felt empowered by the collection. 
 Versace
Donatella Versace celebrated her first true co-ed show for the Medusa maison with a hyper linear collection featuring shortened lengths and nipped-in waists. Though there was nothing reduced about this show, a giant technological marvel where hundreds of Donatella faces opened the show on an 80-meter-long and five-meter-high LED wall. She then brought it to the end in a virtual blow worthy of Princess Leia. Everything emblazoned with 'V's, from python bags and Varsity jerseys to tracksuits and white socks. Trumpeting that under her new American investors, Versace is back with a bang. 
 Bottega Veneta
The most succinct collection and show of the season was by Daniel Lee for Bottega Veneta. Just past the half-way point on the calendar, one could not help noticing that the shoe of the season was without question Lee’s intreccio padded Lido sandals for BV, seen on literally hundreds of editors at shows. This BV display marked a new stage in Lee’s development at the label, a truly beautiful set composed of composite of images of Palladian villas and statuary. Except that the statuary moved. In a co-ed show, guys wore strictly cut long coats with Napoleonic lapels, whose cut would have wowed Vitruvius. The ladies in elongated prim corporate suits for day; and in seamless sequined columns and tulip dresses for night. All of them classy, contemporary and clever.
 Dior
Paris' first major show was Christian Dior by Maria Grazia Chiuri, who returned to the roots – though to her own in this case, referencing her quietly rebellious youth in early 1980s Rome. Opening with charming tomboyish suits, perfectly cut slip dresses, dissected with CD-logo belts and all anchored by combat boots. Matter of fact, about one third of all women attending the season wore heavy boots this season, a trend Chiuri created. Especially useful in Paris where it rained all week like a biblical plague. Maria Grazia has also set the agenda in terms of women’s empowerment. And did so again this season in Dior’s tent inside the Tuileries gardens. From which hung Claire Fontaine’s massive illuminated signs: Women Raise the Uprising; Women are the Moon that Moves the Tides; Patriarchy=Climate Emergency or When Women Strike the World Stops. 
 Lanvin
Few designers are writing more novel chapters in fashion today than Bruno Sialelli, whose latest show for Lanvin was nothing short of inspirational. Presented on a multi-generational cast inside inside Manufacture des Gobelins, arguably France’s oldest luxury marque, used by the Sun King Louis XIV, no less. Exotic affluence from bell-shaped white chiffon dresses with mini feathered capes to beautifully sculpted felt boleros and seductive sheer negligees. The cast attired in leather versions of medieval cornets. Before climaxing with remarkable white coats –made with artfully painted white feathers. French fashion at its most artfully elegant.
 Loewe 
The only designer to merit two collections in to our Top 20 – and for the second season in a row! – is Jonathan Anderson. At Loewe, his latest amalgam of Spanish Renaissance, Ibizan attitude and Paris polish included a new element – ceramicist Takuro Kuwata, winner of Loewe’s own craft prize. The result was seen in breastplates and midriff patches in a collection where gilded silks and brocades were contrasted with somber utilitarian wools. Often more Van Eyck than Velasquez, this was the latest truly path-breaking collection from the iconoclastic Ulsterman.
 Balenciaga
Apocalyptic, but not remotely dystopian, chic at Balenciaga, where the runway was a miniature black lake, and the ceiling a giant screen projecting thunder storms and tempests. Climate change overhanging the collection, in a notably Spanish mood with Cristobal’s high collars and religious aesthetic very present. Hyper exaggerated proportions – like batwing dresses that recalled Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia. And, it being Balenciaga under Demna Gvasalia, a latest logo – blncg – printed across many white jackets.
 Thom Browne
An homage to all things preppy. A work of performance art in a sylvan birch forest built inside the Beaux Arts. A circus ringmaster guiding 33 couples – guys and girls wearing identical outfits. And the latest revamp of Thom’s core concept of the little gray flannel suit with exaggerated shoulders, dropped lapels and micro jackets – embellished with bullion, crystals and grosgrain. The most coherent and consistent conceptualist in fashion who also has plenty of commercial nous. 
 Valentino
In a season still dominated by volume, the man who drove the whole movement, Pierpaolo Piccioli, suddenly reined in the silhouette; darkened his palette, and punked up the attitude. The result was a stellar, poised punk princess collection of 'no categories,' as he put it. It often managed to be genderless, never gender-bending. Pretty well every model ditching Valentino’s rock-star heels for bovver boots – for evening with sequined columns. And the result was a collection that will be highly influential worldwide.Chanel
Sisterhood à la française at its best at Chanel. Musketeer mode that referenced cult French cinema classics from Peau d’Ane, a musical comedy shot around the chateaux of the Loire, or Les Biches, Claude Chabrol’s dark tale of doomed bisexual love. All shown on a cast that marched in twos or threes; arms linked; chatting happily. Jodhpur and riding breeches worn with divine white duelists shirts; forgiving new-classic four-pocket Chanel jackets; dashingly lean 12-button coat-dresses; all finished with great Byzantine costume jewelry. The season’s most romantic show, lifting the gloom even as rain fell torrentially outside the Grand Palais.
 Louis Vuitton
Unquestionably the best staged show of the month, thanks to the unerring eye of show producer Es Devlin and a truly monumental set. Some 200 opera singers in full historical costume, dressed by Oscar winner Milena Canonero. Standing six feet deep in a giant living tableaux, singing along to a stupendously baroque and electronic soundtrack by Woodkid and Bryce Dessner. The collection wasn’t half bad either; Nicolas Ghesquière in great form, riffing on multiple eras, and blending genders. Mannish pinstripe cigarette pants, Edwardian-dandy waistcoats and Savile Row rocker jackets with slanted pockets; all combined with space-age techie finishes ramped up silver jacquards; parachute pants and mock moonboots. An audacious mix that should not really have gelled, but did in a powerful final statement; and a vigorous and original vision of fashion and our relationship to time.

"Mar 5, 2020","Folklore and dance. Flamenco flavours and bullfighting tones. Spanish designers Leandro Cano and Arturo Obegero closed Paris Fashion Week with a tribute to Spain and its artistic traditions. Two different styles that illustrated the new wave of Spanish design at Cervantes Institute in Paris.Leandro Cano“I wanted to pay tribute to Spanish folk icons,"" said Leandro Cano backstage of his latest fashion show, referencing Rocío Jurado, Lola Flores and Imperio Argentina. “It was about playing with 60s and 70s elements, returning to the brand’s roots. We have created a world of floral prints, with coins bearing a message that reads 'A tu vera', a drawing of a hand doing a flamenco pose, and a manila shawl,” said the designer. The collection was inspired by María José Llergo, a flamenco artist from Pozoblanco who provided the voiceover. According to Leandro Cano, Llergo is “the new face of flamenco”.Six designs were presented, all in white except for the show’s opening look. “We have used fabrics from previous collections and other discarded materials,” said the designer, highlighting the gold accents and use of golden brass across the accessories. “I wanted to  encapsulate the ostentatious part of folklore,” he said about the flamenco-themed artistic collection, which will be sold alongside his latest ready-to-wear collection, Imperio.

“I am very much into folklore. And folklore has always been linked to Easter and religion. I tried to get away from that because I had already done a religious-themed collection, but I realised that I always ended up going back to this theme. And I decided to stop fighting it,” smiled the designer, born in Ventas del Carrizal, in Jaén. When asked about how well his Andalusian references will be received abroad, Leandro Cano is open to feedback. “I have no idea how they will receive it! Probably as something quite exotic!” he said nervously as the show ended.Arturo Obegero“I am from a small town in Asturias, called Tapia de Casariego. We were just five people in my class. And I’ve just presented my first collection in Paris. I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Spanish designer Arturo Obegero with a big smile on 3 March. He graduated from the Goymar School of Fashion and Design in La Coruña before getting a degree in pattern making from Central Saint Martins in London. And then he received a call from Paris. “I worked at Lanvin for a year as part of the new creative team,” he said. Obegero worked under the leadership of Bruno Sialelli, who joined the French fashion house as creative director in early 2019.

Like Leandro Cano’s, Obegero’s fashion show was held at the Cervantes Institute in Paris. He drew inspiration from the world of performing arts. “I am a dance lover, and the idea was to create my own dance company. I wanted to take elements from surrealism, from aristocratic cuts to a bullfighter inspiration…” said the designer, showing a mood board that featured images of Antonio Gades, Georgia O'Keeffe, Rudolf Nureyev and David Bowie. “Each couple of models represent a classic play, such as ‘El Amor Brujo’, ‘Orfeo ed Euridice’, ‘Swan Lake’ and ‘Romeo and Juliet’.”

The Academia collection encompassed 14 looks, each an expression of his sartorial skills. The silhouettes appeared to be flying, with wide leg trousers, crisp white shirts, asymmetric dresses, backless forms and bold volumes. Each outfit pushed forward a colour story that ranged from classic black and white to deep red and pale blue. There were both men’s and women’s looks, a co-ed formula the Asturian designer wanted to pursue. “I don’t consider myself a unisex designer, and I don’t want to give my brand a gender fluid label. I just make clothes. For me, it comes naturally. It’s the way I dress and how I see other men and women,” he said.

Among other initiatives, the designer wants to continue showing at Paris Fashion Week and launch an e-commerce site that will stock the most commercial pieces, including high waist trousers and silk shirts, which will be priced at €480 and €400, respectively. “All production occurs in Paris with natural materials I source from the big brands. I want to be as environmentally responsible as possible and grow in an organic way without resorting to the need to overproduce,” he said. His designs are released in limited numbers, with just 10 pieces of each style going on sale. And the materials used are surplus fabrics bought from the likes of Fendi and Givenchy. “I want my collections to have soul and poetry. I don’t want to design just another product, there are already enough on Instagram. I want to make people feel special,” said the designer. And he is open to talking with investors: “For now, the investment behind the brand are my savings and my mother’s support,” he said with a hint of gratitude.

"Mar 4, 2020","On Tuesday, the last day of the Paris Fashion Week, Gauchere joined fashion’s top flight after presenting its collections off-calendar for several seasons, and staged a successful maiden show. Marie-Christine Statz, 37, a designer fond of carefully constructed minimalism, introduced a comprehensive, coherent wardrobe built around a powerful style.Ample suits, oversize jackets and men's shirts, statement trousers and overcoats are the foundations of Gauchere’s Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection, which also features calf-length dresses and skirts. Most of the garments are made in wool or flannel, a few stand-out looks also featuring soft leather for trousers and shirt dresses, as well as fine knitwear.
 
The clothes are precisely cut and rigorously monochrome, in a neutral, highly masculine palette in which greys predominate. The cuts are sharp, and the volumes are mostly accented at the shoulders. Dresses cinched or tied at the waist with sliding belts fastened at the back emphasise this power-shoulder effect, as do the pagoda shoulders featured in some dresses and sleeveless jackets.“Men's tailoring is at the heart of the collection, but it's a relaxed kind of tailoring. I wanted to play with the rules of executive style by emphasising the shoulders, to empower women,” said Statz, talking to FashionNetwork.com backstage. “For this first show on the official calendar, I wanted to send a very clear message, focused on a notion of Brutalism and on an imposing, extremely minimalist silhouette, always inspired by menswear,” she added.
 
Statz is a perfectionist, her painstaking couture featuring details that are sometimes invisible, such as the double-breasted jackets that cross over from left to right, a hallmark of her label - which is called Gauchere from the French word ‘gauchère’, left-handed, as Statz is. An overcoat can also be worn as a cape, thanks to slits under the sleeves. A shirt leaves one arm completely bare. The back of a grey flannel jacket is streaked with tassels, giving it an unexpected cowboy feel. An oversize shirt is made of pin-stripe fabric. 
Germany-born Statz grew up in Düsseldorf and graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York, before settling in Paris, where she specialised at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne (the Paris couturiers' union chamber). She worked at Narciso Rodriguez, then at Diane von Fürstenberg, before launching her own label in Paris in 2013.
 
“I began with only 35 items, which were bought by Le Bon Marché with my first collection. Little by little, the label expanded, attracting an increasing number of buyers. We currently have some 30 clients, notably in Asia, South Korea and the USA,” said Statz, whose organisation, between the atelier and the showroom, has a staff of between 15 and 20. Gauchere’s fabrics are all sourced in France and Italy, and between 60% and 70% of the collection is made in France.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 4, 2020","Legendary French designer Jean-Paul Gaultier may have hung up his scissors, but his fashion house will live on under an ever-changing carousel of guest designers, he said Wednesday.The flamboyant creator -- who bowed out last month after half a century at the top of the fashion tree with a musical spectacular in Paris -- said a guest designer will be given the keys to his haute couture studio every season.

""I have the pleasure to announce the new concept for my Haute Couture,"" 67-year-old Gaultier said.""Each season, I will invite a designer to interpret the codes of the House and I am doubly pleased that Chitose Abe of Sacai will be the first one.""

The two were photographed together on the roof of Gaultier's Paris headquarters in the famous blue overalls he and his collaborators wear.

Abe will show her take on great provocateur's legacy during the Paris haute couture week in July.

""I have long admired Jean-Paul for his originality and his unique subversive vision of femininity,"" she said.

The 48-year-old is one of the most admired Japanese designers, counting Vogue supremo Anna Wintour and the doyenne of fashion critics, Suzi Menkes, among her fans.

She was also one of the very rare rivals that the late Karl Lagerfeld showered praise upon, calling her ""one of the most interesting designers working today.""

Abe's genius is in her unique cut and in recutting and splicing clothing together, ""creating a sum that is greater than its parts"".

She trained with Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons in Tokyo and worked with Junya Watanabe before striking out on her own 20 years ago.

"Mar 3, 2020","Kanye West's presence never goes unnoticed. And even less so when the US rapper shows up in Paris bent on redefining the conventions of a Fashion Week already featuring a whopping 70 catwalk shows on its calendar. First came a Sunday Service: a religious service accompanied by a gospel choir led by Kanye West himself, a surprise event for a select group of guests staged at the Bouffes du Nord theatre in Paris, on Sunday March 1. Shortly afterwards, the news was confirmed: Kanye West had come to Paris to revolutionize the Fashion Week, and would stage an unexpected event on Monday March 2, the Yeezy Season 8 show.
 “The West family is pleased to invite you to a private presentation of the Yeezy Season 8 collection,” tersely recited the minimalist, surprise invitation card in grey colour. “Here is a small fragment of our home in Cody, Wyoming,” added West as a teaser for the show, the only known fact about which was that it was due to take place at the Espace Niemeyer, headquarters of the French Communist Party, at 9.30 pm. Expectations were ratcheted up, and the social media drums began to roll.
 
Cue the crowds that thronged to Place du Colonel Fabien, where the Espace Niemeyer is located, on Monday night. Fans, nosy parkers, neighbourhood residents and guests mingled in the elliptical square, absolutely jam-packed with the attendees’ black cars. Huge, gig-style queues and several security checks, to prevent anyone who was not on the West family’s guest list from sneaking in, encircled the venue, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The iconic building, which over the years has hosted shows by the likes of Prada, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thom Browne, was home to Yeezy’s first catwalk show in two years, the label having decided to drop its collections via lookbooks and private events after Season 5.To the guests’ surprise, once inside the venue, they were handed blankets and heaters to keep warm prior to the start of the show, which was set to take place outside the building’s undulating, wave-like façade. Everyone in the audience, celebrities and commoners alike, had to stand in the cold Parisian night, a scene that would have amused, to say the least, Communist militants. Once again, West upended fashion's established social norms and turned on its head the notion of how, in theory at least, a catwalk show should look like.
 There was no soundtrack, speech or emphasis as a model clad in beige top and white wool trousers opened the show in silence, without many in the audience even being aware it had started. She was followed by 18 different women’s looks which floated down the building’s access path, the show being also broadcast on the Espace Niemeyer’s façade. Outside, Place du Colonel Fabien reverberated with a concerto of car horns as circulation around the square was clogged. The collection’s dominant hues were white, ochre and violet blue, featured in high-rise flared trousers, mostly tucked into the tops of padded mountaineering boots. Models sporting multiple plaits wore skimpy bra-like tops and various types of crop tops, as well as t-shirts, padded vests and jackets, sometimes with ski masks to complete the outfit.
 
The show's punch line was the biggest surprise, and became a viral hit on countless Instagram posts.  West’s 6-year-old daughter North closed the show with a rendition of ZaZa’s smash hit ‘What I Do’. The mini Kardashian West held the microphone in her hand and sang, a cross between a rap and a babble, under the watchful eye of her father, grinning happily a few steps away. No wonder: Kanye West had done it again. A show that brought the Paris Fashion Week, and even all the coronavirus talk, to a virtual standstill, thanks to a child’s performance and the subsequent attention garnered by the West-Kardashian clan. Was it satire of the fashion industry, a special kind of comedy, or boundless showbiz genius? Let the public be the judge. In the end, fashion played a bit part.

"Mar 3, 2020","All about Simone Lacoste at the latest collection from the house, a colorful co-ed show that the wife of the founder would surely have enjoyed.
 “Not many people appreciate that Simone was a champion in her own right, but in golf, not in tennis like René,” explained Louise Trotter in the backstage.
 
Hence, the collection was a meeting of golf and tennis, somewhat ironically as the show was staged in an indoor tennis court.Golf ideas everywhere – mohair tanks for chilly spring round; golf caps for a sunset green shot; plaid soft-collar shirts; tassel putting shoes; and Masters winner blazers, albeit in a far lighter green than Augusta. 
 
“Normally in relationships one is more powerful than the other, but they really complimented each other, very harmoniously,” added Trotter.
 
Though her best ideas were actually the great coats – from the color blocked leather night-watchmen’s coats to soft yellow town-coats. Track pants with side stripes; and softer trench coats all looked strong. Since making coats and jackets in jersey gave the clothes a sense of easy affluence.
 
The British designer’s other big trick was jazzing up the heart of every Lacoste show, the crocodile - exploding it up as an appliqué on duffle coats; and tripling that in size on top of a marvelous looking white silk print shirt.
 
René’s Lacoste logo tennis shirt also got a work over, as Trotter took the classic polo, and double knitted it this season.  
“So, it looks the same but when you put it in on it feels completely different,” said Trotter, underlining how Lacoste himself developed the idea of many the soft collar shirt in cotton piqué.
 
“René was thinking about comfort and performance from the beginning. Luxury today is comfort. That’s when you are most at ease,” insisted Trotter.
 
In short, nothing too revolutionary, but some very convincing merchandise, and importantly a great looking front row of French athletes, actors and musicians.
 
Far too often before, Lacoste ad campaigns featured starched white Caucasians in a vision that had more to do with 1950s France. And not any group of multi-racial sports heroes like all French teams today. Its recent ad campaigns have embraced that; and it was great to see that reflected in the composition of today’s very cool and hip audience.

"Mar 3, 2020","Large numbers of fashion week and trade show organisers may be cancelling events due to happen over the next few weeks, but on Tuesday, the organiser of London Bridal Fashion Week said it will go ahead as planned this month.“As responsible event organisers and in line with our company values, the health and safety of all those who attend our events is our primary concern and priority,” said organiser Ocean Media.

“We appreciate that people may be concerned given the high level of media coverage the coronavirus is receiving, however the risk to individuals in the UK remains low and there are no restrictions on travel or trade. As the first major show in the European calendar, and given the uncertainty in the rest of market, we feel it’s important to give retailers the opportunity to conduct their buying at a time when the risk is low and contained in the UK.”The UK has so far seen little more than 50 cases of coronavirus and while there’s a certain amount of nervousness among businesses, the authorities and consumers, life in general is largely carrying on as usual.

The organiser said that registrations for the event, which takes place at Excel in London from March 22-24, are following normal patterns, and are actually up 12% so far, with buyers registering every day.

Nicola Garton, Chair of the Retail Bridalwear Association (RBA), said the body “will be supporting LBFW in a few weeks’ time, and encouraging all retailers to attend as planned. It’s an important buying event for the industry and we shouldn’t allow speculation and hype to deter from what will be a great opportunity to see the fabulous new collections from our suppliers.”

William Dicks, Chair of the British bridal suppliers association (BBSA), added that it’s “imperative that our industry has a strong and successful trade show to kick off the new selling season. The BBSA and its members are fully committed to attending LBFW and making it a successful show. With far greater uncertainty on the continent, London will be one of the most important buying events of the season.”Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 3, 2020","A pure Parisian moment at Chanel, with all the ease, assurance and stylish impertinence which that implies, in a jaunty show and collection presented on Tuesday.Staged on a chilly morning inside the Grand Palais, this fall-winter 2020/21 collection felt like a burst of much needed optimism, as the four-week international catwalk season ended under the shadow of the coronavirus.
 
A selection of French movie soundtracks set the scene – opening with Peau d’Âne (Donkey Skin), Jacques Demy’s 1970 musical comedy, shot around the chateaux of the Loire. However, while it riffed on French classic imagery with a whole series of musketeer pants; and turned down pirate boots, there was nothing too literal about the collection which looked decidedly contemporary.Chanel’s creative director Virginie Viard had already set the mood with an ingenious video teaser shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin.  Released the day before the show, it captured two models standing on the Pont des Arts, Rianne Van Rompaey and Margaret Qualley, where the first face magically morphs into the second.
 
Von Rompaey then opened the show in a three-piece lime green suit anchored by the boots, marching with Italian model Vittoria Ceretti in a black ensemble of jodhpur pants, unbuttoned from the knee down, baseball jacket and tiny lace top finished with multiple strands of pearls. The pair chatting animatedly, the first of multiple groups of two or three, marching like old pals; often with arms linked; talking and smiling.Dressed in silk boleros with winged horse print; strapless black calico gowns; super strict bouclé wool double-breasted coat-dresses with 12 buttons and an assortment of jodhpurs and jockey silks. Plus, Viard sent out a selection of novel jacket shapes – from micro double-breasted versions with huge splayed collars to forgiving cabans with large patch pockets.

Pretty much every look accessorized with Byzantine jewelry, in bright mosaic colors – crosses, earring, necklaces and bracelets. 
 
“Romantic, easy, a Parisian,” explained Viard, looking remarkably relaxed in the post-show backstage.
 
The cast strolling happily on a giant mirrored floor, covered with dry ice; the audience of 2,600 sat comfortably on the slopes of a white magic mountain. Half way through the mood turned dramatic, as the soundtrack came from Les Biches, Claude Chabrol’s dark tale of doomed bisexual love, which includes the icy beauty Stéphane Audran moodily tossing a note to a street artist - also on the Pont des Arts.
 
The mood, however, was insouciant throughout, heightened by the brilliantly styled loosely tied hair and naturalistic makeup and beaming models.
 
“Did you know that Coco Chanel actually had a racehorse called Romantica?” smiled Viard.
 
Asked about her starting point when creating the collection, she pulled out her mobile phone and showed an old black and white photo of Karl Lagerfeld and Italian fashion editor Anna Piaggi. Her predecessor dressed in pirate boots. “I began with these!” she laughed, pointing to the footwear.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 3, 2020","With stores in India and New York, multiple clothing brands and a global celebrity following, fashion designer Anita Dongre is a feminist powerhouse in a male-dominated industry. But her true ambition is to create an environmentally sustainable company, she says.""Sometimes I wish I could just give up design and focus on sustainability full-time,"" the Mumbai-based Dongre tells AFP during an interview at her factory outside India's financial capital.

""Time is running out. Climate change is right at our doorstep and we all have to do something,"" says the 56-year-old, whose clothes have been worn by some of the world's most high-profile women including Hillary Clinton, Kate Middleton, Ivanka Trump, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and Beyonce.Turning a company with an annual turnover of $105 million into a carbon-neutral enterprise is a daunting proposition, but Dongre has never been one to shy away from challenges.

When she started her business aged 23, armed with two sewing machines and a staff of two male tailors perched on the balcony of the bedroom she shared with her sisters, she was the first woman in her conservative family to work.

Today, she says that of all her accomplishments, she is proudest of her commitment that no woman seeking work will ever be turned away from the gates of the four-storey factory she runs.

""I see my journey reflected in theirs,"" she says, emphasising her belief that ""economic empowerment is the only way a woman can assert herself"".

Besides producing five clothing lines, hand-crafted fine jewelry and accessories, her foundation provides training and jobs to more than 250 rural women, with plans to cover 30 villages by 2025.

- Greenwashing risks -

Feminist values have been at the heart of her brand: her clothing has always been size-inclusive, going up to an XXL. 

Even when she ventured into bridal wear, her advertising campaigns challenged traditional norms and featured women sporting tattoos, enjoying their wine, and paying for their weddings.

""It is very important for me to show a woman who is not coy or veiled -- someone bold and sassy. I was that girl. I drove a jeep. I proposed to my husband,"" she says.

""The world has never been fair to women... and I am not comfortable promoting regressive ideas to sell clothes,"" she adds.

Her decision to focus on the urban professional woman has seen the brand reap dividends as female spending power increases in India.

""It's so rewarding to walk into stores and meet the women who buy my clothes. When a customer tells me, 'I wore your blazer to my first job interview 15 years ago and I got the job', it's thrilling,"" she says.

She will need to rely on that goodwill to convince customers to shop in a wholly different way than they are used to: prioritising sustainability and slow fashion over instant gratification.

On the one hand, Dongre's task has never been easier -- when she spoke about environmentally-friendly design more than a decade ago, few paid attention. Today, she says drolly, ""I am glad it's finally fashionable to be green"". 

On the other hand, greenwashing remains a huge risk, she explains.

""You can't take a sustainable fabric, cover it with plastic sequins and still call it sustainable.""

- 'Do more and more' -

She is the only Indian designer to join the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), a global alliance of retailers, brands, suppliers, campaigners and labour groups that provides members with the tools to measure the environmental impact of their activities.

The SAC is a non-binding organisation, meaning members are largely responsible for their own efforts towards sustainability and transparency.

For her part, Dongre says she feels a drive ""to do more and more"" on the environmental front.

At her factory, cafeteria food waste is composted or used to make biogas while the water utilised in clothing production is recycled and pumped back into the bathrooms.

Her lower-priced brands AND and globaldesi use fabrics such as sustainably-produced tencel -- a biodegradable fibre made of wood pulp -- while the slow fashion luxury label Grassroot showcases hand-woven, hand-embroidered designs created by Indian artisans.

Yet this commitment to sustainability and to preserving dying crafts comes with risks attached, as Dongre realises.

""The biggest challenge is educating the consumer to support our efforts,"" she says. 

Moreover, it is hard to imagine how a huge company that employs 2,700 people and works with thousands of artisans can be environmentally responsible without compromising on profits.

It is a price she is willing to pay.

""Companies cannot be driven only by profits... this idea of making money in whatever way possible and then giving large sums to charity, it's not sustainable. Why not make contribution to your community a focus of your business to begin with?""

""It's high time companies measured their success in terms of sustainability, not just profit and loss,"" she says.Copyright © 2022 AFP-Relaxnews. All rights reserved."
"Mar 3, 2020","One of the most significant results of the massive movement for women’s empowerment, at least in fashion, is a revival of clothes with a positively noble air. Such was the case in an inventive and truly original collection from the house of Alexander McQueen presented Monday evening, on the penultimate day of the international women’s ready-to-wear catwalk season. 
There was something decorous and rather grand about these clothes, presented inside the Carreau du Temple, a wrought iron mid-19th-century market in the north Marais, revamped with some mega-wide ash floorboards, the better for the cast to march on. And march they certainly did, behaving like women in haste and en route to important appointments.
 
Alexander McQueen’s designer Sarah Burton always manages to maintain her focus, especially in this Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection, which throughout suggested stylish events, great openings, major concerts and movie premieres. For these were clothes for special occasions.A baronial, ceremonial opening. A dandy drummer’s double-lapel jacket that became an officer’s coat, a mega-checked and striped power-shouldered coat, before a one-shoulder Amazon on the Avon warrior dress. And then some eye-catching coats in the fabric of the season – believe it or not, Prince of Wales check – except dissected with genius with huge diagonal black bands.
 
There was also Maid Marian in a white virginal smock dress with a train, except this was finished with delightful perversity, with a harness and an open back. In effect, the fabrics added a few kilos to too many looks, but that also added a voluptuousness that was very real, and very now. Really rather voracious glamour.
 
All the way to the finale – sort of Mary Queen of Scots meets Leigh Bowery when the Ministry of Sound takes over a royal wedding looks. And a stupendous silver cocktail concoction made of multiple shards of crystal, worn by the beautiful black model Adut Akech – Calypso, who managed to detain Odysseus for a few years, arising from the depths of the Aegean inside in the Carreau du Temple.
 
Every model wore fierce coppery red waxed-down hair, the gutsiest and yet also the most elegant, and empowering, hair styling of the season. Nice work after over 350 shows.Everything, pretty much, was anchored by hefty bovver boots. Then again, half the women at this show were already clad in hefty boots, as long as you exclude American and French Vogue staff. High-heel reductionist to the end. One recalls Talleyrand’s verdict on the Bourbons.
 
In summary, a very distinctive collection by one of the ten most inventive fashion designers on the planet. Perhaps not one of her vintage collections but even a couple of points off her A game, Burton still leaves most rivals in her slipstream. Or should we say moat?Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 2, 2020","Many collections have been returning to a certain sophistication at this season's Paris Fashion Week, with models wearing elongated silhouettes, elevated with sparkling earrings and necklaces. And the trend was especially pronounced on Monday, as Sacai, Y/Project and Giambattista Valli hosted glamorous runway shows for refined ladies. 
 With their high-heeled boots, long leather gloves, statement earrings, pearl necklaces and golden chain chokers, the women on Sacai's catwalk strode through the night under continuously sweeping spotlights. For next winter, Chitose Abe opted for an ultra-chic wardrobe, where, for the first time, eveningwear played a starring role. 

Most notably, evening pieces were fused with outerwear to make unique hybrid looks, a mix which gave formal outfits an everyday feel and vice-versa. Satin sheath dresses incorporated long coats or took on the guise of elegant suits, some of which were blended into sumptuous white cable-knit jumpers. Bombers were extended to the ground, where they meshed with organza to become original parachute dresses.The collar and placket of a white shirt appeared on flowing ensembles tailored in classic menswear fabrics, and creative director Chitose Abe also opened trousers out, laying them flat and applying the two large legs to the front or back of a dress for a trompe l’œil effect. Black trousers were attached like a loincloth to a t-shirt dress, as well as to white shirt dresses.
 
This season the construction was built around a kind of long, loose tunic, to which different pieces of fabric were grafted, revealing another facet of the garments as they moved to create a kind of two-in-one look – ""a fourth dimension silhouette,"" as the Japanese designer put it. Weighty gold chain necklaces and large white pearls also put in an appearance at Y/Project, although the latter were used to decorate black pumps, along with finer gold chains, which were wrapped around shoes, but also around a spider's web bustier. Sexy striped stockings were reimagined as sheaths that were split at the front and back and worn with a simple pant or a bodysuit and top. 
 
Shiny, undulating ribbons were used to create an improvised evening gown beneath a tunic in black organza, while part of a puffy golden dress was tucked into a boot. An imposing black velvet cape dress with a turned-up collar leant a queenly air of haughtiness to the model wearing it as she closed the show majestically. 

As he does every season, creative director Glenn Martens had fun blurring the boundaries of couture, exploring all kinds of new construction techniques. For Fall/Winter 2020-21, he concentrated on the pelvis, which appeared to be clasped by the two halves of a mussel shell formed by a high-riding pant cut into a V at the waist. 
 
These trousers were split at the crotch into two ogive-shaped petals which rose up the models' hips, a balance-defying shape that the designer repeated in a wide range of pieces, ranging from tops to bodices and jackets which plunged into funnel-like skirts. The highlights among these looks were a set of incredible suits with bodysuit-blazers, while elsewhere these V-cut trousers revealed an integrated thong. 

In the remainder of the collection, the fabric of tops, trousers and skirts was wrapped around models' waists for increased volume, while shirts that had been folded lengthwise were fastened to the straps of tops, like scarves. Jersey dresses were corkscrewed at the waist and scarfs were wrapped around models' wrists like XXL bracelets or around their arms to serve as original pouches. 
 Pearls were back with a vengeance at Giambattista Valli, where the models wrapped themselves up in multiple long strings of them. The Italian couturier made this collection with the classic Parisienne in mind, sending out young girls who appeared to be on the cusp of womanhood and walked in flat mocassins or boots, donning opera gloves and pastel pink outfits exuding delicate lightness. Some topped their looks off with a black velvet hair bow or a little crystal-encrusted veil. 

The wardrobe's palette focused on contrasting shades, such as pink and black, revealing the ambivalent nature of Valli's Parisienne, who was both romantic and seductive, and had a strong personality. The models alternated mini-dresses and little coats and skirt suits with flouncier floor-length dresses in silk, tulle and satin, while ostrich feathers adding an airy edge to proceedings.

"Mar 2, 2020","Beautiful People has entered the fourth season of its ‘Side-C’ concept project which explores the space between the outside and the lining of a garment. The label presented a more wearable take on deconstruction this season, and although items appeared simple at first glance, each one contained a hidden feature to give a fresh surprise, as if it were a trick by M C Escher.The main theme of Beautiful People’s Side-C / Vol.4 ‘Intimate’ collection was showcasing materials that are often hidden inside a garment such as lining and padding. The lining of a checked trench coat that could be seen at its opening also peeked out from its double lapel. In addition, other classic and elegant yet transformed items stood out such as a two-tone reversible robe-style coat where the left and right sides were switched half-way; a cape with an integrated checked lining, and a skirt with a printed lining that could be seen on its asymmetrical hem.
 
Knitwear and accessories played a big role this season, as did dresses that featured three layers of thin jersey. The clothing allowed the wearer to show a number of colours and varied expression depending on how they choose to wear the clothing and some of the bags could have their entire shape altered by the wearer.The collection centred around wool and used textiles with a sense of class, such as menswear suiting, and had an underlying colour palette of black, grey, khaki, and neutral. With soft, flowing silhouettes, the collection’s clean and minimal style echoed the mainstream aesthetic. Designer Hidenori Kumakiri has managed to successfully insert his transformed-garment concept and quirky patterns into the everyday wardrobe.The linchpin of the collection was the reversible puffer coat. The garment’s filling was inspired by architectural insulation, a material that was also used for the show’s invitations and for the runway set at the venue. The collection’s industrial-style print, which brings to mind packaging used for building materials, was also striking and the textile was designed from scratch for the collection.
 
“In the coming era, we must not only make things, we must also think about what happens to them afterwards,” said designer Kumakiri, speaking about the need for greater consciousness about sustainability. As well as using recycled materials, Kumakiri created garments designed so that they can be worn multiple ways which leads to a new way of consumption where we own less and use more.
 
“I have pushed the boundaries between construction and deconstruction,” said Kumakiri. “Instead of staying on one side of this dichotomy, I hope to create something new from it.” The collection presents conceptual ideas as classic, wearable items. The brand has already established a solid position in Japan and global expansion could be on the cards in the near future. Outside of Asia, Beautiful People is currently distributed in France, the US, and the UK.
 
“Conscious of the boundaries between men and women, I decoded to showcase menswear and womenswear at the same time because I had incorporated elements such as men’s workwear,” Kumakiri said about the brand’s first time showing menswear looks on the runway.
 
The collection had an industrial mood and conceptual designs which were translated into classic and basic items and it concluded as a wearable collection for both both men and women.

"Mar 2, 2020","This weekend, idiosyncratic US rap star Kanye West staged a surprise Sunday Service in Paris for the fashion week, combining a gospel choir concert and a religious celebration which also had a social media echo.“Sunday Service. Kanye West, this Sunday morning at the Bouffes du Nord [theatre],” tweeted the theatre, which is located in the French capital’s La Chapelle neighbourhood.

Pictures showed West centre-stage alongside a piano, encircled by a gospel choir, its singers clad in flowing beige robes.French magazine Paris Match posted a video of the service on its Instagram account, stating that it was attended by West’s partner Kim Kardashian and their daughter North. Also present, several fashion industry names, among them Olivier Rousteing, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Jean Touitou.

West, 43, has said he has been saved by religious faith, and last Autumn released the ‘Jesus Is King’ album, featuring songs from the Sunday Services he has been holding on an itinerant basis, often as a surprise event, across the USA.

On Monday night, West will stage a surprise catwalk show in Paris for the latest collection of his Yeezy label, in collaboration with Adidas.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Mar 2, 2020","Tokyo Fashion week has become the latest high-profile event to be cancelled on the back of the coronavirus outbreak that’s still growing around the world.On Monday, Japan Fashion Week Organisation (JFWO) said it was cancelling the event, despite assurances in recent weeks that it would go ahead. The decision today has come as no surprise however, with the fashion week, which is officially known as Rakuten Fashion Week Tokyo 2020 A/W, coming at a time when a large number of conferences, exhibitions and other events that would involve big crowds have been pulled by their organisers.

Tokyo Fashion Week had been scheduled to take place from March 16 until March 21.The organiser said that as “apprehensions due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak rise daily, our primary and utmost concern always being the safety/security of all parties involved, after heavy discussions with related parties, we have come to the painful decision of there being no other choice than to give up RakutenFWT 2020 A/W”.

And it added that for those brands that had been scheduled to take part, “JFWO will continue to do our very best within our power, to provide support in gaining business opportunities, such as introducing collections on the RakutenFWT 2020 A/W official website, support in having looks introduced in national and international medias, etc”.

It also apologised to “all those people who have poured time and effort into participating in this event. We are sincerely sorry for having to reach this disappointing decision”.

The cancellation comes as several shows during Paris and Milan fashion week's were cancelled as well, although the giant events as a whole managed to continue. 

Many trade show organisers that were planning exhibitions in February, March and April have postponed them to later in the year with a number being planned for this summer.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 2, 2020","New Wave, the last great movement in French cinema, and the artists associated with it were the wellsprings for the latest collection from the house of Givenchy, staged inside the Hippodrome de Longchamp. 
Presented Sunday night in a dank and chilly Paris, the Fall/Winter 2020-21 was surprisingly grand given the humble, indie and off-the-cuff origins of New Wave. Though the real sources were the engaged feminist artists who date from the New Wave era, notably the artwork of Helena Almeida, who had a retrospective in the Jeu de Paume last year.
 
“My Work is My Body, My Body is My Work,” was the name of the exhibition on Almeida, who was in her late 20s at the height of New Wave. And human shape and form was decisive in these clothes.The result was grand, even grandiose silhouettes, exaggerated curvy shoulders and elongated profiles. Creative director Clare Waight Keller’s fire red double-face cashmere coats were utterly charming as was her heavenly light gray floor-length gown finished with putty green gloves. Plus, the assemblage looks had real punch, like the arty harlequin red and black pantsuit, shown with a red, white and black silken scarf tote.
 
The UK designer is certainly talented when it comes to evening. She is a class act who creates classy gowns. For day, this collection was less convincing – with too few plausible ideas for work or play. Far too many ideas were too dressed up for an office quite frankly.
 Nonetheless, the metallic walled set, and 100-meter-long catwalk looked great. And the paddock reinvented as a cocktail bar, bathed in red dry ice and serviced by a score of chisel-jawed barmen made for a fantastic pre-show cocktail. However, the long series of tight runway spotlights made the show lighting a nightmare. As a result, most mobile phone images were all out of focus. Has no one ever heard of Instagram in the production company?
 
Be that as it may, whatever else you say about Waight Keller, she is a great image maker. She is also a designer who loves a big hat, the bigger the better: her giant cloches were one-meter in diameter, helping to create a dramatic finale.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 2, 2020","Just when everyone was beginning to grumble, albeit very quietly, that Pierpaolo Piccioli’s recent obsession with volume was starting to get predictable even a little old, along comes the designer with a stellar darkly romantic collection, and a subtle change of gears at Valentino.Possibly no front row looked more glamorous today than that of Valentino, where scores of very well-heeled clients showed up in flowery, acid-hued, uber-glam finery. Posh femininity at its poshest. The show, however, was a cunning mixture of polished punk attitude blended with screen goddess grandeur.

“No categories. I don’t mean gender bending, I mean people being independent individuals and wearing whatever they want. Like my opening look, which was a man’s coat very like the opening look in our menswear show but this time worn by a woman,” explained Piccioli in a packed backstage at Valentino’s custom-made show space, just to the west of Napoleon’s Tomb.The mood was set with the soundtrack, where a string quintet played movie theme music and Billie Eilish emoted in a remix of “All The Good Girls Go To Hell.”
 
Moreover, at a house where the signature color is sinful red, almost all of the first 20 looks were in black. Again, as in the brand’s latest menswear collection, beautifully rippling silk coats and sleek leather dusters were finished with bold single images of flowers and stems – all in unexpected tints and hues, from pale silvers to faded reds.
 
Everything – bar a few movie award columns – was anchored with boots:  NATO marching boots, punk rocker style or Chelsea boots with three-inch-thick foam soles. Even patrician red cashmere coats and society hostess red plissé frocks came with UK bovver boots. Posh punk that never looked retro, always fresh.Plus, Piccioli introduced a great new bag, studded, cut with multiple petals and finished with bows. Named the Valentino Garavani Atelier, it is sure to be a major hit.
 
And that all led up to a majestic finale – several Aphrodite-worthy silken and chiffon columns that brought forth a huge cheer as the designer took an extended bow – even rising onto the rostrum to embrace the string quintet.

"Mar 1, 2020","""Have you ever looked at your closet and realised that, among all those clothes, you always end up wearing the same 10 things?"" asked Lutz Huelle at his latest runway show for Fall/Winter 2020, held at Paris' Palais de Tokyo on Friday, 28 February. ""It happens to me a lot, which made me start to think about my favourite pieces. What makes a piece of clothing your favourite?"" asked the German designer, who, in a recent interview with FashionNetwork.com, defended a vision of fashion as an industry in which everything starts over from zero twice a year.

This season the designer opted for a timeless collection, halfway between the classical and the urban, and built around the pieces that he considers to be his ""favourites."" The first of these was an intensely fuchsia oversized two-piece suit which was knotted at the waist and served as an introduction to a range of reinterpretations of mannish tailoring. Comfortable double-breasted wool blazers with structured shoulders were paired with slim-fit or high-waisted trousers, while elsewhere Huelle used different tones of reclaimed denim to make patchwork ensembles, or transformed bomber jackets into raincoats and knee-length skirts. As explained by the designer, these pieces were all the result of upcycling, using a trench from last season or a variety of different jeans.

On top of this, there were the inevitable shirt dresses and blouses in poplin, the golden brocade that appeared on a frilly skirt and a pantsuit, the camel overcoats, the fuchsia taffeta bomber, and the satin dress in shades of yellow, black and burgundy. All in all, the show was a kind of declaration of intent, a return to the basics from the back of the closet, which were worn by models walking to the varied rhythms of ""You're So Vain"" by Carly Simon, ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" by The Slits, and the early-noughties hit ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears. Once again, the playlist played an important role at this latest show from Huelle, who often sends invitations to a select group of show attendees in the form of vinyl. 

""Ultimately, this collection became a way for me to revise my work from the last six seasons, to reevaluate and pick out my favourites, and everyone else's favourites, while trying to design pieces that will become the favourites of tomorrow, that can be worn time and again,"" concluded the designer, highlighting the pleasure of wearing a two-piece suit, knowing that ""you only need two minutes to get dressed and look good.""Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 1, 2020","Balenciaga hosted a high-impact show at Paris Fashion Week on Sunday, a kind of dramatic contemporary opera. It was beneath a changing sky, reflected by a water-covered stage, that Demna Gvasalia, creative director of the Kering-owned luxury house, decided to reveal his collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21, mixing influences and energies from the past with his unique vision of the future. The runway was intense, opening with an apocalyptic atmosphere before gradually returning to a lighter, more frivolous version of fashion.An immense expanse of black water stretching as far as the first rows of audience seating served as the runway, reflecting a giant screen suspended from the roof. The scene was set. It was hard not to be reminded of the recent flooding in Venice as the first models made their way down the catwalk under a threatening sky, splashing everything in their path as they walked, especially as some of them sported never-ending thigh-length fishing boots, much like those seen on the laguna at the end of last year.

The climate emergency was a palpable presence, particularly in the images that flashed across the ceiling and were reflected and expanded throughout the show space – gales, lightning, foaming waves, concrete jungle urban landscapes and even a burning sky, which bathed the space in a red glow and seemed to tinge the water with blood. The first part of the extensive collection offered up a series of austere all-black looks in materials such as leather, wool, silk and nylon. They completely covered the models' bodies, featuring high collars or hoods and channelling an aesthetic inspired both by the clergy and the distant past. The overall feel of the wardrobe also seemed to echo the old religious iconography of Spain, homeland of the house's founder, Cristobal Balenciaga. 

Heavy coats, slender tunics, velvet cassocks, magistrate's robes with flaring sleeves, skirts, suits, windbreakers and even a double-breasted jacket extended down to the water the models sloshed through, and were worn by both men and women of all ages, some of whom had been made up with worryingly red eyes. This dramatic spirit was further emphasised in a series of dresses, jumpers, jackets and suits featuring exaggerated, squared proportions and topped off with pagoda-style shoulders that turned up towards the sky. New construction techniques were used in the collars of certain wool coats, which were extended and transformed into capes on one side. Another coat was worn inside out, while a jumper was folded over and pulled up the back as far as the model's head to serve as a hood. A prickly jacket with rubber spikes was a particular highlight, as was a hooded peasant dress in latex. 

Flashes of red were slipped in among the predominantly black looks, in the form of a long, fine coat, for example, a latex cape-dress or a pouch. Other colourful elements included a mimosa-yellow print inserted into the front of a black dress, while the letters ""blncg,"" a contraction of ""Balenciaga,"" were printed diagonally across certain jackets in white. 
 
In the second part of the show, the wardrobe took a sharp turn, veering into an aesthetic marked more noticeably by streetwear and channelling a sportier register. This style seemed to be more specifically conceived for men, combining baseball caps and chic tracksuits, with leather motocross gear composed of pants and jackets featuring knee, elbow and shoulder pads. Soccer also put in an appearance, with models wearing handsome jerseys in the colours of team Balenciaga. With the brand name printed above the player number on the back, these shirts will no doubt sell like hotcakes. This collection's range of accessories also looks sure to have a bright future, especially one lunchbox-shaped bag. 

For evening, Gvasalia had fun making gala looks that were simultaneously tight and draped, using a single piece of brightly coloured stretch fabric to make a dress, pantashoes and gloves. 

The designer also experimented with stretch fabrics in a series of original figure-hugging suits this season. And, in a similar vein, he even came up with some ultra-skintight bodysuits for the boys, which simultaneously covered everything and left very little to the imagination.

"Mar 1, 2020","The sixth day of Parisian runways offered a thrilling round-the-world tour of creative design, with shows from Japan's Junya Watanabe, Colombian-born Parisian designer Haider Ackermann, Britain's Vivienne Westwood in collaboration with her Austrian husband Andreas Kronthaler, and Rokh, the label from young South Korean designer Rok Hwang.  
Unruly manes of platinum blond hair, smudged makeup, leather dresses and deconstructed perfectos attached at the hip like tails or voluminous skirts all came together at Junya Watanabe's runway show, where models started out walking in silence under a red light that put one in mind of a photographic darkroom, the only sound to be heard being the flashes of cameras. 
 
Suddenly, the lights went up and the voice of Debbie Harry began singing ""Heart of Glass."" The frontwoman of Blondie, the legendary new wave rock band of the 1970s and 80s, was the muse chosen by the Japanese designer and former Comme des Garçons protégé for this punchy and rebellious collection for next winter.Leather was the dominant material, appearing in flared apron dresses in black or red, which were worn with tulle petticoats, mini-skirts and quilted shoulder pads, but could also be seen in more recognisable elements of the iconic rocker jacket, which were inserted into coats or blazers. 

Above all, though, leather was used to give a kinky boost to the silhouette with a range of accessories, such as belts, bras, buckles, straps and removable harnesses featuring a multitude of bags and pouches, which were worn over classic tweed coats and jackets, as a means of protection or restriction, depending on one's taste.
 
Overall it was a skilful collection, where the designer mixed commercial basics with inventive, deconstructed creations, accompanying the apparel with a number of fashionably twisted accessories.
 Haider Ackermann also opted for silence, not to open but to close his runway, a powerful show built around pure simplicity. Men and women came down the spotless catwalk in elongated monochrome looks, their bare chests peaking out from long half-closed coats or little jackets with lace necklines. 

The women looked like they had been airdropped in from another galaxy, giving off a strange majesty with their towering hairstyles and virginal outfits. Maxi-coats were worn over legs that were clad in rubber or squeezed into leather. 
 
Dark, elegant sheath dresses opened up into a saw tooth pattern at the top, revealing a white vest, while the trains of long skirts caressed the ground. The men donned impeccable coats and banker suits, as well as shimmering velvet ensembles in nocturnal shades, shot through with luminous flashes. Everything was perfectly balanced through sober, minimalist tailoring.
  
As has become her custom in the last two years, at the start of the latest Vivienne Westwood show, the label's eponymous founder came and took a seat right in the middle of the front row, while her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who is now in charge of the house's signature line, was busy putting the final touches to the models backstage. At the end of a show rich in flashes of inspiration, the Austrian designer hurried over to the queen of punk with a bouquet, leading her up to the centre of the runway to thundering applause from the audience.

Men and women walked together, often in outfits cut using the same materials. This season's Westwood woman was multifaceted. At times she was aristocratic in Victorian dresses in tulle, moiré taffeta or flannel, puffed out at the hip with drapery or bubbly volumes, while her waist was cinched with a corset that also accentuated her bust.

At other moments she became an eco-warrior with something of a wild edge, wearing mix-and-match ensembles created using recycled or recovered materials. She walked proudly in her unmatched socks and her ruffled maxi-dress, which looked to have been fashioned from a black bin bag. She even traded her pearl necklace for triple strings of garlic or chili peppers. Her black coat featured fluorescent graffiti, while long muffs stretching up to her armpits seemed to recall straitjackets. 

Over at Rokh, South Korea's Rok Hwang returned to a more classic – though no less inventive – vision of chic for Fall/Winter 2020-21, with a collection dedicated to his little sister. ""I wanted to write her this visual, textile love letter, on the day that she is getting married in Seoul, while I have had to stay in Paris for this runway show,"" explained the talented designer, whose brand is currently distributed via some 150 top multibrand stores around the world. 
 The collection explored the different faces of a young woman ""with a strong and determined attitude, on the one hand, and a sunny and joyful disposition, on the other."" In the first part of the show, the models walked through the rows of heather in mules and sheer black stockings, over which they wore dark suits and coats with a tailored feel. Some featured slits and removable sleeves or were decorated with construction stitches. Slim, celebrity-inspired sunglasses completed the look, along with chunky chains that bordered collars and sleeves, or were used as bag straps, belts, headbands or necklaces. 

This dark lady then gave way to a more romantic aesthetic, seen in long dresses and flowing floral-print silk blouses with pagoda sleeves, created by the brand in collaboration with English artisans, as well as skirts of different lengths featuring fine pleats and tartan patchwork, and little jumpers decorated with floral embroidery. For day-to-day wear, Hwang played with deconstructed trenches, the tartan lining of which was sometimes exposed, or remixed suits, sending out one version which could be buttoned and unbuttoned at both the front and the back.

"Mar 1, 2020","This season Thom Browne devoted himself to a genre he truly adores, the WASPs, and their most traditional sub-culture, the preppies.
 Rarely has this designer’s love of classic prep school style been so evident than in this Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection, staged on a miserably wet Sunday afternoon in Paris.
 
His set, on the other hand, was more conventionally Thom Browne – a winter birch wood doused in fake snow, where the master of ceremonies was a lanky model in hyper platforms and a ringmaster coat piped in the same club tie colors as his kilt.Gesturing energetically, he conducted out the cast – 33 couples all told, wearing identical outfits – a proper first in fashion, which is rare. And, though Thom didn’t break that much new ground in terms of technique, his atelier has rarely been in such good form.
 
Models wore assemblage compositions of trench coat, classic jacket, kilt, business suit and blazer, often in a single look. Exaggerated shoulders, dropped lapels, micro-jackets contrasted with grandiose white ties. And there were all sorts of embellishments – bouillon, crystal embroideries and grosgrain ribbon trim.
 
Mannish gals and ladylike gents – every one of them carrying a grain leather handbag. Talk about a Noah’s Ark of bags, each in the shape of a different animal – tortoise, hippopotamus, Shetland pony, cobra, rooster, terrier, elephant, dachshund and black sheep among many others.
 
Everything was made in gray, navy, black and white with dashes of repp ties, Prince of Wales check and elegiac intarsia. In a word, America’s most important contemporary tailor was working his favorite theme – the gray flannel suit and the hidden fantasies and perversities of uptight New England. 
Nearly 20 years ago, Browne opened up a tiny tailoring store in the West Village of New York. Today he retails in over 300 leading department stores and specialty boutiques worldwide. His is a triumph of skill, energy, talent and, above all, a tenacious attachment to his own naughty WASPy vision.
 
No wonder they gave Browne a rousing ovation at the finale – he deserved every clap.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 1, 2020","The décor at the latest Hermès show consisted of a vast sand-coloured carpet, from which rose a multitude of white posts with coloured bands, instantly recognisable as the bars from show jumping fences. This quirky staging set the tone for the colourful Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection unveiled by the French saddle maker on Saturday evening. 
  Indeed, creative director Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski had taken her inspiration from show jumping competitions to create a highly functional collection where leather was king, while also mixing in other materials seamlessly. Skirts and long waistcoats were worn under coats in padded leather, which put one in mind of the blankets used to cover horses.

The collection paid a heartfelt tribute to Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. The first part, in particular, included a series of pieces in the primary colours so dear to the Parisian designer, while also playing with his fun sporty style.The shades of yellow, cyan and magenta that decorated the fence bars around the runway could also be found in monochrome polo dresses, fine turtleneck sweaters, the pleats of a dress and patchwork jumpers which recalled jockey silks – one sleeve blue, the other yellow, while the front was red. 

To underline the hommage to de Castelbajac, Vanhee-Cybulski had invited the designer to the show and didn't hesitate to put him centre stage post show, telling journalists that ""in the 1980s, he was ultra-modern."" The Parisian designer seemed touched by the gesture. 
 
The remainder of the collection concentrated on outerwear in a neutral palette built around shades of white, black, beige and chocolate. Waterproofs in tough gabardine, rubbed shoulders with parkas, puffer jackets and parka-dresses. ""The collection aims to be practical, utilitarian and beautiful,"" explained the creative director.

Following this logic, the hoods were removable, the leather was waterproof, the pockets were deep and the conception versatile. The collars of the pullovers were even equipped with a kind of woollen ring in which a scarf could be secured so as not to blow away. 

The leather pants were numerous, while lamb, calf and goatskins were also used to make coats, pleated skirts, blazers, mannish suits and jackets with pronounced shoulders. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Mar 1, 2020","The Paris Fashion Week is having to deal with the anxiety sparked by the Covid 19 epidemic. On Thursday 27 February, LVMH cancelled a cocktail party organised for the LVMH Prize emerging designer competition, causing a momentary ripple of concern to spread within the French luxury world. A few days before, catwalk shows by Chinese labels had been cancelled, and Boss announced at the start of the week that it would refrain from presenting its new collection, having recently showed in Milan. However, all the other shows and events, both on and off the official calendar, were still scheduled to go ahead as the fashion week got under way.LVMH’s announcement about its gala evening on Thursday caused a sharp intake of breath, and was followed by the cancellations of the Net-a-Porter-Re/done event at the UK embassy on Friday, and of presentations scheduled by Byredo on Friday, Rosie Assouline on Sunday and Sandro at the start of next week. Designer Geoffrey B. Small also announced the postponement of the event he was due to stage with concept store L'Eclaireur on Friday. The label is based in the Italian region of Veneto, a Covid 19 outbreak hotspot, and said it took this decision out of caution and a sense of responsibility. Nevertheless, these announcements didn't trigger a snowball effect.

Although the LVMH Prize cocktail party was cancelled, this was not the case for the meetings between the competition's 20 shortlisted designers, from all around the world, and the jury members, among them Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe, Delphine Arnault, the prize’s mastermind, and top model Gigi Hadid, who all attended.The CEO of one of the LVMH group’s leading labels took the opportunity to emphasise how important it is for the industry that catwalk shows do go ahead, underlining the need for fashion to put up a responsible, optimistic front in these troubled times.

“Since the fashion week started, no show has been cancelled,” said the French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation, adding that “the Sphere showroom is still on at the Palais de Tokyo. There are no changes to the official calendar.”

And while a string of trade events have been forced to cancel, in Italy and also Switzerland, where the Geneva watch industry show was ruled out, as of February 27, there is no question of cancelling events in Paris.

The fashion industry in Paris is hoping not to experience the same situation faced by the Milan Fashion Week and the whole of northern Italy a week ago. French authorities, after a first death linked to Covid 19 was recorded on Wednesday, are trying to allay fears.

“There clearly is a perceptible (...) anxiety in France, and we want to respond to this concern by means of everyone’s joint efforts, with calm and rationality. There are neither grounds for fear, nor for negligence,” said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Thursday.

The luxury and fashion industry professionals currently gathered in Paris for the Fashion Week are endeavouring to follow these recommendations. And while Asian visitors, and a number of Italian ones, are missing, and everyone is keeping an eye on developments about the coronavirus epidemic, catwalk shows are going ahead almost normally.

In some cases, welcome kisses and handshakes have been eschewed, replaced by polite greetings exchanged at a prudent distance. Antiseptic gel was distributed at the entrance of the Paco Rabanne show on Thursday, as were face masks. But the latter don’t seem to be very popular with the fashion world. Despite the recommendations to travellers coming from Asia and Milan, only a handful of people wearing masks can be spotted in Parisian catwalk show audiences.

"Mar 1, 2020","With the popularity of sportswear, womenswear has evolved a lot over the last few seasons, progressively putting more and more emphasis on comfort. Although the sporty trend has now given way to allow for the return of a certain elegance, silhouettes continue to gain volume through increasingly generous and loose clothes. This style could be seen to a certain extent at the Loewe and Balmain shows on the fifth day of Paris Fashion Week, but was present above all at Nina Ricci and Christian Wijnants. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the hyper-sexy, feminine aesthetic is still a solid favourite with brands such as Redemption and, more notably, Olivier Theyskens. 
 Nina Ricci entered a new dimension this season. Having taken the reins at the Parisian label a little over a year ago, Hyères Festival-winning couple Lisi Herrebrugh and Rushemy Botter are now fully settled in and decided to execute a sharp change in direction for their third season at the brand. Gone was the bourgeoise of yesteryear and the polite young lady seen in more recent seasons. For this fall, the Nina Ricci woman jumped headfirst into contemporary fashion with an all new wardrobe, notable for its cool minimalism and wearability. 
 
Aside from a few dresses and blouses in organza and ruffled lace, and the now famous colourful cloche hats, the collection's overall feel was simpler, more laid-back, seeming to prioritise comfort with loose clothes tailored in fine fabrics. Oversized trousers, for example, were made in supple leather, reversible coats in felt, while taffeta dresses were pleated like parachutes and maxi cache-coeurs were offered up in cosy wool. Elsewhere, satin pyjamas appeared in a choice of black or zesty orange. As they often do, the two designers also had fun with deconstruction, remixing codes and playing with all kinds of details. Blazers ended just below models' chests, a bit like spencers, and were worn over long shirts, while banker suits were cut with short sleeves, black pea coats featured white buttons, and trenches were ruched up under the collar, flaring out like capes. A khaki coat and a leather jacket were also transformed into mini-capes, and skirts were slit on all four sides. Over at Christian Wijnants, the Belgian designer signed off on a beautiful collection for next winter, injecting a simultaneously aqueous and aerial quality into a wardrobe where knitwear reigned supreme. Loose, flowing trousers were paired tone on tone with jumpers, shoulder pads or tunics, sharing the runway with combed-wool coats and knitted coat, jumper and skirt ensembles in the same shade of ecru. 
 
The clothes felt both enveloping and open, occasionally leaving the models' arms and back exposed. The proportions were all stretched, without ever being exaggerated, not even in the XXL pants in wool or weightless viscose, or in the padded jackets with large lapels. Taffeta was wrapped around one model's body like a draped dress or sari. 

The designer's wardrobe was no less free-flowing and rhythmical in his fishnet dresses, which featured a myriad of colourful strips to create a shaggy fringe effect, or in the outfits that he decorated with zigzags of wool. This energy was further accentuated by intense explosions of electric blue, emerald green and orange, which contrasted with a palette that, in other places, was soft, almost washed out. 
 There were no half measures with Olivier Theyskens, who will split his time between his namesake brand and Azzaro next season, having recently taken over the artistic direction of the latter. For Fall/Winter 2020-21, the Belgian designer gave a punchy remix of his signature romantic style. This season's wardrobe was dominated by black and ultra-short cuts, even if one or other longer or lighter look did sneak its way in. Most importantly though, the collection's spirit was sexy throughout, with invariably skintight clothes. 

Sunglasses, leather gloves and high heels set the tone, while the little black dress was this fall wardrobe's star piece, offered in silk or leather, with long or short sleeves. A number of suits consisted of little jackets and micro-skirts, but powerfully cut men's suit also put in an appearance, albeit often worn directly over the model's bare chest, or with nothing but a bra. 

Lingerie could be spotted here and there, as could a kinky touch of bondage, visible in the knee-length leather boots, as well as in a full jumpsuit in the same material, and in trousers and dresses in satin that shone like patent leather. For the evening, Theyskens sent out long monochrome dresses that flowed down to the ground with a refined simplicity. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 29, 2020","On a busy Saturday, amid torrential showers and bursts of icy blue skies, two very diverse talents – a Lebanese master, and a Frenchman of Chinese and Basque origin – staged two excellent shows, whose contrasts summed up how diverse great fashion can be in Paris.  Elie Saab: Andalusia meets Phoenicia 
Andalusia met Phoenicia in the latest show from Elie Saab, in one of the boldest collections in many seasons by the Lebanese designer, as an injection of Spanish Gothic added some welcome spine to Saab’s DNA, a vibrant fashion pulse that also wiped a decade off his look.Saab also added some crisp and snappy tailoring, opening with a quartet of trouser suits. First a striking black velvet power tuxedo, cut with a surgeon’s touch, and worn with a white silk stock, followed by some hyper-ladylike houndstooth double-breasted blazers.
 
Though the Iberian influence was clear in all the Spanish touches – seen in fabulously ruffled white flamenco shirts and sexy contessa gowns, cut away to show acres of leg. Saab also riffed on the inky black of El Greco and the austere shades of the Spanish Renaissance, with fantastic black lace shirts, tent dresses and high-waisted evening dresses.
 
“Nothing like a little touch of Spain,” smiled Elie after his show, the soundtrack of which featured extracts from Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias.
 
Saab always draws an ace crowd – from uber influencers like Olivia Palermo and Diala Makki to brainy media stars like Christiane Amanpour, along with his loyal following of Middle Eastern princesses, and Levantine it gals. All of whom gave him a rousing cheer as he took his bow inside the Palais de Tokyo, as sunlight suddenly broke through the heavens. Altuzarra: Quiet elegance at its best 
“Purity, refinement and silhouette. That’s what this was about,” commented Joseph Altuzarra, after a collection that delivered all that and more.
 
From flowing plissé cocktails to charming frocks slit up the thigh, all made in beautiful marbleized prints or faded flower patterns. Everything decidedly refined. For day and the office, razor sharp wool pantsuits with intriguing slashes and hyper-precision darting, all belted insouciantly.  
 
Post show, Altuzarra explained that he was inspired by his grandmother, who emigrated from China in the 1940s and last year sent him a large suitcase of handmade clothes from her youth in her homeland.
 
“They came out creased and crumpled. And, they had a certain mystery, which I wanted to capture,” explained the designer, after being mobbed by his cast, who clearly loved the polish of the clothes.

"Feb 29, 2020","Few designers are more admired by contemporary Parisians than Hedi Slimane, currently the French creative director of Celine. And one can understand why from this latest collection, a co-ed selection that managed to be rather bourgeois yet faintly subversive at the same time.  
 Staged late on Friday night inside the latest mammoth Celine tent built behind Napoleon’s tomb, this was a co-ed event, since Celine had not shown menswear during the French season in January. In the end, the majority of the looks were for men in this show, worn by the latest Hedi youthquake cast. Pre-show, hundreds of French kids practically fought to gain entrance to the show in a real fashion frenzy.
 
Slimane referenced all sorts of classic modern posh Parisian ideas – silken bows, culottes, redingotes, mini gilets – but then disrupted them elegantly with unexpected proportions and unlikely combinations. Who would expect a soft lambskin biker jacket to be cut with ruffled lapels? And what about the great combination of a rocker redingote with a Norfolk jacket in some ingenious tailoring? And you just know there will be a flurry of orders from rock stars for his duffle coats with golden frogging and bullion trim.The cutting and silhouette were a timely reminder that when it comes to high-end runway brands, Slimane is the most important single tailor in fashion since Giorgio Armani.
 
His Celine ladies are a clever combination of impertinent Saint Germain mademoiselle, devil-may-care London rocker and moody Californian. Though for Fall 2020 they are posher and tonier than normal, heading out for night in shiny, silken, dresses; golden plissé frocks; and tinsel-like cocktails. Whoever he has in his atelier – whether a Young Turk, or an experienced hand – certainly knows what they are doing. When the weather turns inclement, the Celine girl marched in pleated culottes, high-heel boots and Yorkshire check capes.
 
Backed up by a sensational soundtrack – “Get Out of My Head” by Sofia Bolt – and staged before the latest ginormous light sculpture – with a thanks in the program to Fondation César – the show received a huge roar of approval from a giant bleacher of fans. Not a word of explanation in the program, by the way. Hedi might faintly irritate a lot of critics due to the recent predictability of his shows, but he does give the people what they want.
 
A post-show email did highlight the Sulky, an archive signature – an equestrian touch from 1966 developed by Richard Vipiana, the husband of brand founder Céline. And, indeed, these were the best array of accessories which Slimane has developed. 
Sovietologists used to divine the leaves of the future by who stood where on the podium during the May Day rally in Red Square. Similarly, fashionistas interpret the hierarchy within LVMH by the presence, or lack of, Bernard Arnault at any show.
 
No sign of BA at Celine this evening, but with coronavirus casting a shadow over everything that may not mean much. His only daughter Delphine and her partner Xavier Niel did appear though. Through the closed backstage, they went to salute Slimane. The designer, however, was nowhere to be seen. Sibylline Slimane to the end.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2020","On Friday French label Agnes B joined the list of fashion houses that have cancelled shows at Paris Fashion Week due to the coronavirus outbreak that has reached multiple countries around the world, while Saturday saw Paris-based A.P.C. make a similar announcement. Six Chinese designers, inculding Jarel Zhan and Masha Ma, have already cancelled shows at the Paris event scheduled to run until March 3.

Fashion labels such as Balenciaga, Valentino, Chanel and Louis Vuitton have planned to unveil their Winter 2020 collections this weekend and next week.In Milan, Italian house Armani has staged its show behind closed doors, while France's Chanel and Italy's Prada have already cancelled shows in China over fears about spreading the epidemic.

The rapid spread of the coronavirus raised fears of a pandemic on Friday, with six countries reporting their first cases and the World Health Organization warning it could spread worldwide.

The spread also prompted Switzerland to cancel the giant Geneva car show.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2020","Isabel Marant gave her models a confident self-assurance with strong silhouettes cut in beautiful fabrics for Fall/Winter 2020-21. As explained by the designer backstage, ""this is my neo-classical, structured collection, with real well-made clothes. There's a touch of luxury but it's all very wearable and accessible.""
 Hooded ecru capes were worn like djellabas, while neutral-coloured shearling was used in comfortable furs, as well as in sleeveless coats and jackets which added a Berber feel to proceedings. This effortless style was further emphasised by the knitwear, which included comfy jumpers and knitted dresses with puff sleeves slits up the front.

This season's Isabel Marant woman walked nonchalantly in her thigh-high leather boots, her hands resting in her pockets, her waist cinched by dresses, skirts or trousers clasped in large belts, her shoulders consistently accentuated. This silhouette inevitably evoked the 1980s, especially with its squared shoulders, which were sometimes covered with shoulder pads with an intergalactic edge. ""I like women's legs and shoulders and I like to bulk them up. It's like injecting them with strength. These women are urban warriors,"" explained Marant. Only, instead of armour, her warriors donned padded jackets with printed patterns, men's suits in grey flannel and draped leather dresses. 

This co-ed show also featured the designer's fifth menswear collection. Here the silhouette was more classic and toned-down, with models pairing creased trousers with cable-knit jumpers or putty-coloured overcoats, and pea jackets with jeans.

"Feb 28, 2020","When graduate student Haobo Zhang decided to design underwear specifically for transgender women, his ambition was more high-minded than simply turning in a project to complete his master’s degree in fashion at the University of Delaware.Zhang wanted to fill a need that would help bring comfort and respect to the millions of people around the world who identify as transgender.

One of them is Willa Patsy Sharpe, a registered nurse named William Patrick Sharpe at birth, who agreed to submit to an intimate interview and a full body scan at the university’s Innovation Health & Design Lab in Newark after answering a call for volunteers.The computer-generated avatar created from the scan and insights from talking with Sharpe and other trans women will help Zhang create the first-ever transgender underwear designed for mass production, according to Martha Hall, director of the lab and an assistant professor of health sciences at the university.

“I want to help people who are previously ignored, make them feel comfortable and align with what they want to be,” said Zhang, who is working with a lab team.

Zhang’s project grew out of a conversation that Hall, his academic advisor, had with an underwear designer at Calvin Klein, the global fashion house.

“He suggested we work on a gender-fluid collection. I took it one step further,” said Hall.

The 24-year-old Shanghai native said creating a vision for transgender underwear is exactly the kind of work he wants to undertake as part of his dream career as a functional designer.

“Functional design is apparel that makes people’s life better. A garment can protect a fireman, a garment can help disabled people live more conveniently,” said Zhang, who is not a native English speaker. “Some trans woman want to hide their genitals.”

Sharpe, 60, a divorced father of two who “came out” at age 56, said most transgender women are not trying “to deceive the world” but simply want to be comfortable and feminine.

“There has got to be a way to flatten your jewels,” said Sharpe, who also has three grandchildren.
Sharpe said existing transgender underwear produced by boutique manufacturers is artificial and uncomfortable. In one line, each panty featured a padded cup molded to resemble female genitalia.

Sharpe said she answered the laboratory’s call for participants after other trans women told her of techniques they employed to conceal their male genitals, from wearing a double layer of women’s panties to binding themselves with duct tape.

To be comfortable and natural-looking, Zhang said some trans women may need prosthetic enhancement in some areas and “tucking in” in others.  

“I would like enough appearance that makes people second- guess, so that they don’t automatically call me, ‘Sir,’” said Sharpe, whose testicles have been surgically removed.

“Each time someone calls me ‘Sir,’ it’s like a little dart that hits you. Sometimes you just have to deal with it. Like cry,” Sharpe said.

An estimated 25 million people worldwide are transgender, according to the medical journal The Lancet. In the United States, an estimated 1.4 million adults identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, a research group that focuses on sexual orientation and gender identity. 

Zhang’s goal is to complete the project in order to graduate in May, and Hall hopes to expand its scope to trans men and possibly sell the underwear nationally.

But for Sharpe, the effort is much more than a fashion project.

“This study means not just understanding our community, but affirmation: You do exist,” Sharpe said.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."
"Feb 28, 2020","Shanghai Fashion Week, initially postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will go ahead as scheduled online in a tie-up with Alibaba Group’s Tmall marketplace, its organizers said.The event, which last October hosted eight couture shows in its Spring/Summer season, was among numerous trade and business events in Asia that announced changes to their dates this month due to the coronavirus.

The recent Fashion Weeks in London, Milan and Paris have been hit by the absence of many Chinese attendees.However, the Shanghai Fashion Week committee said on Thursday in a statement on their official WeChat account the event will go ahead as planned between March 24-30. It told Reuters that people can participate by watching livestreams.

It said it was currently accepting applications from brands and expects that more than 100 Chinese designers and brands will eventually display their 2020 Autumn/Winter designs and also use livestreaming to market their Spring/Summer products.

Alibaba’s Tmall marketplace has cooperated closely with emerging Chinese designers and commercial brands in past years. Last year, a collection of Chinese brands showcased their products at New York, Milan and Paris’ Fashion Week events via China Cool, a project initiated by Tmall.

Selling through livestreaming, which sees telegenic and chatty hosts market products to consumers on e-commerce platforms, has surged in popularity among Chinese consumers in recent years. Besides Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo also have livestreaming offerings.

"Feb 28, 2020","If you asked most people attending shows in Paris this week who is the freshest voice in fashion these days, the most likely response would be Jonathan Anderson, who presented a novel, notable and noble collection for Loewe on a chilly Friday morning in Paris.Anderson has been combining elements of Parisian chic and Spanish Renaissance art for some time at Loewe. For fall winter 2020/21 he added another particular layer – the works of Takuro Kuwata, a Japanese ceramicist who won a special mention in the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, a craft award that Anderson invented for the Spanish brand. 
 
The results were incorporated into breastplates and stomach patches in a series of ornately shaped dresses; and in a brilliant collection of chunky bracelets and squares that dangled from some smart bags like the Flamenco clutch.   Working with gilded brocades and silk jacquards, contrasted with utilitarian wools, Anderson dreamed up a bravura fashion statement. Curiously, many of the finest shapes recalled van Eyck or Vermeer rather than Velasquez. Like the opening dresses with strict torsos that flared below the waist; or a really brilliant Confederate gray armadillo cut coat that had front-row buyer nostrils flaring with envy. He cut just one suit in black serge, and it hung perfectly – plus it was complemented by super snazzy pumps finished with pearls in the house’s logo 'L' pattern.
 
Though the stand-out moment was a trio of beautiful silk jacquard gowns worn with beefeater large feather headgear. The one in putty gray worn by an Asian model was veritable Instagram heaven.More than most designers creating for two significant houses – in his case, Loewe and his own label JW Anderson – the Ulsterman has largely avoided leakage between the two aesthetics. This season there was a little, such as a pair of giant A-line coats with massive lapels that recalled his London show 11 days ago. But overall, Jonathan’s ability to keep the two concepts separate – especially when it comes accessories, the heart of any business – has been impressive.
 
It’s been a European catwalk shows season where it’s been very a la mode to use veteran models. Anderson, however, kept them on his front-row seats – as Amber Valletta, Doutzen Kroes, Karlie Kloss and Carolyn Murphy all sat together opposite Anna Wintour and Anderson’s ultimate boss, LVMH honcho Sidney Toledano, who runs over a half dozen brands within the luxury empire, including Loewe.
 
And so, the audience exited UNESCO, where every Loewe show by Anderson has been staged, out into a dank day, but with large smiles on their faces. Tellingly, few broader than that of Toledano.

"Feb 28, 2020","Abloh certainly creates a good set – a selection of Mercedes cars, chopped in half, horizontally and vertically, were the focal point of a group of squares around which his cast walked in his latest show. Not quite John Chamberlain, but pretty darned good. 
Intense cameramen with Steadicams recorded each passage of an impressive cast inside the Marcel Cerdan boxing arena in eastern Paris, few causing such a ripple of excitement as Yolanda Hadid, the 56-year-old mum of Bella and Gigi, strolling proudly by in a white blazer with gray graffiti smears, one of several in that style.
 
Her youngest daughter Bella had made the first passage in a stiff black mock--Elizabethan dress with elaborate neck ruff and collar her bosoms flaring. Robert Dudley would have been pleased, as she made for a great opening. Big sister Gigi took the final walk-by in an assemblage of Faerie Queene gown dissected at 45 degrees by a sporty ultramarine parka. No wonder the designer entitled this Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection “Slightly Off.”Virgil has always loved a cut-out, and did Swiss cheese versions of white knit or cotton tops and dresses – not entirely happily on Carolyn Murphy – and cutaway trenches, so one could see large bloomers on the likes of Mariacarla Boscono. His other big idea was Friesian cowhide skirts, pants and raincoats in an Egyptian blue and white. There are those who feel that Virgil shops a little too much for ideas – but all of the above were very much his own notions.
 
This designer earns a very good living at night as a DJ, and his soundtrack was the best in Paris so far: jazz drama from the likes of Chick Corea and Yussef Dayes. Though those of us who have tried to dance to his DJing at fashion parties have found that trickier. 
All told, a thoroughly respectable runway performance and collection, though certainly no paradigm-busting moment. Especially in a week when The New York Times speculated in a long article that Virgil Abloh might be this generation’s Karl Lagerfeld, albeit in a story written with a large pinch of salt. On the grounds that Karl, like Virgil, was a multi-tasking jack of all trades, who sold his services to multiple brands.
 
No one can question Abloh’s undoubted commercial appeal, it’s his quality, range and soul that is in doubt. And sense of modesty. Lagerfeld was quite possibly the most calculating individual in fashion history, but also an individual without false airs of grandeur. As someone, who knew him for three decades, I cannot recall him ever referring to himself as an artist. That’s not something one can say about Virgil Abloh.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 27, 2020","The womenswear collections shown in Paris are never commonplace, as was demonstrated on Wednesday by, among others, Dries Van Noten’s nocturnal flamboyance, Rochas’s relaxed chic, and Guy Laroche’s musings about sustainable fashion.
 Dries Van Noten showed a stunning Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection, in which colours, materials and prints collided powerfully, creating a uniquely beautiful ensemble. Van Noten chose to celebrate night life, hovering between extravagance and glamour, from the unforgettable parties of 1930s Hollywood to the smoky nights of 1970s London clubs.
 
He dipped his collection in a twilit nocturnal palette veering from opaque to glittering hues: maroon, bright red, acid green, intense ochre, lapis lazuli blue, violet, lilac, orange, olive green, emerald and gunmetal grey. Above all, he blended styles with gusto.Tartan woollen jackets and overcoats, as well as check trousers and shirts, blend with glam items like draped velvet dresses, gowns decorated with bucolic Hawaii-style floral prints, and skirts and tops in ruby-red ostrich feathers.
 
Biker-style leather trousers and jackets are paired off with tops featuring oversize floral prints or a python-skin skirt. Shearling coats are dyed in rust or violet tones. Devoré velvet combines with latex, raw denim, satin and even silk. A brocaded dress glimmers in the night.
 For his last season at Rochas, Alessandro Dell'Acqua designed a nonchalant, effortlessly chic collection. Clad in woollen tights and perched on vertiginous velvet platform sandals, the Rochas girls wore long, flowing silk dresses in warm colours, from pink to violet, orange, liquorice and rust, scattered with crystals and gems.
 
They were equally at ease in men's suits in grey or sky blue, and in dresses glittering with shaggy golden thread or embroidered with a wealth of decorations. The collection alternates between lavish outfits with oversize furs and cascading gems, and more minimalistic ensembles in strictly tonal looks.

One of them for example combines two orange overcoats, worn one over the other, with a handbag in the same colour. Elsewhere, the trousers, top, turtleneck sweater and jacket are all in the same electric blue. For the evening, the Rochas girls opt for clothes enhanced by long black and silver fringes.
 
Guy Laroche didn't stage a catwalk show, but presented an unusual installation. The label’s creative director, Richard René, unearthed 12 vintage Guy Laroche items, which he bought and photographed in actual size.
 From this starting point, he designed 12 looks made using only the raw materials available in-house at the label. A black suit’s trousers take on a contemporary twist with long lateral slits at knee height. Strips of black vinyl are rolled around a series of printed dresses, adding a touch of character.
 
Four other items have been created in beige wool and silk, symbolising a “renaissance” and the theme of upcycling. As Guy Laroche indicated in its collection statement, 39 million tons of clothes worldwide were thrown away in 2019.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 26, 2020","John Galliano has always been obsessed with wardrobes even if these days, in his designs for Maison Margiela, he is all about tearing them apart. Especially if it’s the wardrobe of the very respectable bourgeoisie.That’s true for both men and women, sometimes at the same time. From his opening look in his show for Margiela inside the Grand Palais in Paris on a chilly Wednesday.  What could have been a classical mannish tailored coat was cut away to reveal a see-through gown, hung over a silken dress – seams, padding, horsehair and stitching all evident. A pure artistic fashion statement – just like much of this thoroughly excellent collection.
 
Galliano continually lightly layered with the subtlest of hands; whipping up all sorts of intriguing visions – in a masterclass of cutting and disassembling with manic zeal. From brigadier’s coats with just one mutton-shaped sleeve to an Eliza Doolittle lace dress that seemed to interweave with a floral trench, which itself was decomposing. Even woolen socks seemed to be un-sewing themselves, in a collection themed around what Galliano’s notes termed “the technique of work in progress.”The atmosphere, punchy yet polished, aided by an excellent color palette – powdery roses, oranges, lilacs and pinks. The UK designer also worked the house’s codes, with obvious commercial skill. Like the cloven-toe boots the founder made famous, used in new split-toe loafers that will walk out of Margiela’s worldwide retail network.
 
Being a Galliano show, there had to be a dose of stylistic wickedness. This season John had several disruptive moments.  For this finale, several deranged dandies, in majestic great coats, with one-foot-wide lapels, trimmed with belts, complete with Alaskan trappers’ caps or huge symmetrically pinched Rocky Mountain hats. They say the Mounties always get their man. Now so does Maison Margiela.

"Feb 26, 2020","Good to see a properly trained professional designer back at Kenzo, as Felipe Oliveira Baptista made his debut for the house on Wednesday with an imposing display of fashion. 
Oliveira Baptista certainly looks like he has been working hard, riffing on key elements in the Kenzo DNA, from the iconic tigers to the bold abstract colors. Moreover, in a season of volume, the designer was right on target with his enveloping shapes and grand forms.
 
The debutant’s theme was global travel, recalling founder Kenzo Takada’s famous journey on a cruise liner from Tokyo to France - a youthful ingénue in search of glory and couture in Paris. Most of the cast was wrapped up as if in a gale on that liner; nearly every head covered with cowls, caps and hoods; inclement weather incoming. So much so, some of them looked like rather posh refugees.Though, the Portuguese-born designer instead referenced his own youth in the Azores, and riffed on a memory of his parents about to stage a parachute jump in Mozambique. Using parachute fabric in billowing floral or pop-art camouflage parkas and cabans to great effect. 
However, the standout moments were elongated tunics and djellabas done in mash-up prints where big cats fought it out with abstract expressionist daubs and Francis Bacon-worthy twirls and smears. Again, a peninsular reference to Felipe’s homeland, in this case the Lisboan artist Julio Pomar.
 
When the nomads finally ended their journey in a big city, they donned military-style leather trench coats or funnel-neck spy coats; accessorized with cartridge or military belts and fanny packs in a co-ed show where the boys and gals wore similar looks. Instead of the sweatshirt-dominated style of his predecessors chez Kenzo, this felt like a complete fashion statement, and wardrobe. 
That said, the actual staging was something of a disaster, one of those very clever ideas that didn’t quite work. The set was a lattice of three-meter-thick inflated transparent tubes, like a hi-tech garden, where one expected to find plants, not people, inside. However, a sudden half-hour of sunshine rendered the space deeply uncomfortable, with an intense glare that made it almost impossible to see the clothes properly. The best laid plans…
 
Designed by producer Bureau Betak, which this week announced laudable plans to create shows with a negative carbon footprint, the tubes are designed to be recycled and used in, for example, pop-up stores. We pray not on too sunny a day.

"Feb 26, 2020","A wave of uniquely recognisable Parisian chic swept the catwalks in the French capital on the second day of the Paris Fashion Week. Starting from Dior, where it assumed the mildly rebellious, gamine look of a young woman standing tall. Notably also at Coperni, whose everyday Parisian chic was at once smart and casual, and at Victoria/Thomas, ready for a night-time romp in the City of Light.
 On Tuesday morning, the spotlights were trained on the show by Coperni, the label that was successfully relaunched last year by Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant, who first laid its foundations between 2013 and 2015. Their maiden catwalk show won the critics over, presenting a well-honed collection with a futurist twist. The cuts are razor sharp, as though carved with a scalpel, hugging the silhouette and playing with asymmetries.
 
The models seem to come straight from visionary sci-fi film ‘Gattaca’ featuring Uma Thurman, their hair gelled and swept back, eyes hidden behind futuristic glasses from the label’s first eyewear collection, sporting geometrically shaped handbags and clad in mini dresses or tight trouser suits in grey and black.  The looks are uber-clean and the colour palette subdued, with navy blue, khaki, black and grey, plus the occasional flash of red and a few pale-yellow outfits. The wardrobe consists of essential garments with a highly contemporary feel, designed with a diagonal vanishing line.
 
Meyer and Vaillant took special care in the details. Double straps are used to fasten an overcoat or attach a clutch bag to the waistband of a pair of trousers, buttons are positioned in undulating rows, laces are used to accent a blouse or an open-work dress, and fabric bands do the same on a braided one.
 
The looks are either very, very short or much lengthier, with long, straight ultra-fitted trousers and sleeves whose ends drop down almost to the ground in some jackets and shirts. Coperni, whose e-tail site is launching this week, is distributed via some 50 directional multibrand retailers worldwide, and seems to be well set up to accelerate and grow further.
 For the Fall/Winter 2020-21, Victoria/Tomas drew its inspiration from Parisian night life, transforming its sleeved tops into sexy night-out outfits. Jewellery, chains, crystals, gems and golden buttons take over clothes and accessories, as in the golden-tipped boots trimmed with chains, to make them glimmer until dawn.
 
Here too, a designer duo is in charge: Victoria Feldman and Tomas Berzins. They revisited all their great classics, from trench coats to shirt-dresses and flared skirts with pointed hems, adding all kinds of glam details and glittering decorations but always managing to avoid mawkishness. On the contrary, keeping punchy Parisian chic firmly in their sights.
 
A large chain morphs into a golden necklace, attached with rings to the tips of a shirt-dress’ collar; minuscule metallic chain tips float feather-like on a quilted gilet or a pair of ample leather trousers. Crystal drops rattle at the tips of safety pins stuck to the pockets of a jacket and a pair of red trousers.
 
A cardigan worn as a short dress is made up of different swathes of knitted wool held together with rows of golden buttons. The hems of some overcoats are trimmed with long fringes, and so are the flowing skirts worn under leather jackets. An envelope crops up as a surprise pocket slotted diagonally at the bottom of an ample turquoise jacket.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 26, 2020","German fashion designer Philipp Plein is feeling the repercussions of his fall 2020 fashion show, after his effort to pay homage to the late basketball legend Kobe Bryant was widely criticized on social media.Held during Milan Fashion Week, the show included a collection of purple, crystal-covered jerseys featuring Bryant's number '24', as well as the word 'Plein' written in large gold letters. While many social media users commented that the jerseys themselves seemed to co-opt Bryant's image too soon after his death and appeared ""tacky"", even more outrage was sparked by the runway set's inclusion of gilded helicopters. Bryant, aged 41, his daughter Gianna, 13, and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash. 

In a now widely circulated letter, the designer explained that the catwalk set was already planned and designed in November 2019 -- prior to Bryant's tragic death in January -- and that it was too late to replace the helicopters. Plein also used the letter to note that the profits from the capsule collection will be donated to Mamba & Mambacita, Bryant's charity, and said that $20,000 was donated to the foundation the day before the show. More than one of the Kobe pieces retail between $2,000 and over $3,000.  

“...I feel that my fashion show have been the best moment to express my respect and admiration,” Plein said.

“It is sad to see how something positive and constructive can be misinterpreted by people who obviously want to interpret negatively without even having a reason.""

The designer continued, saying that he is ""really doing something to help and to support the foundation,"" underlining the words ""I am"" once and ""really"" multiple times.

This incident isn't Plein's first brush with public backlash. The designer has previously been accused of unthoughtful, problematic behavior for reportedly ""fat-shaming"" a journalist who wrote a negative review of his fall 2019 show, and for advertising his brand's Black Friday sales with an ad featuring a female model covered in cuts and blood, the day before the international day for the elimination of violence against women.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 25, 2020","Mame Kurogouchi by Maiko Kurogouchi kicked off Paris Fashion Week’s fall/ winter 2020 season with a collection entitled ‘Embracing,’ held at the Faculté de Pharmacie de Paris.

The brand, which has recently garnered much attention through its collaboration with Tod’s,  managed to interpret Japanese manufacturing in a poetic and wearable manner and put on an emotional show even in a climate where both consumption and industry-wide sectors such as production and logistics are being forcibly reviewed due to the recent coronavirus outbreak. The brand managed to interpret Japanese manufacturing in a poetic and wearable manner and put on an emotional show.
 Milan Fashion Week saw the shadow of the coronavirus lengthen as the event launched last week. The irony may not have been lost on the buyers and editors that escaped to Paris, fearing the virus, that Mame’s show was held at the University of Paris’ pharmacy faculty. In the venue’s courtyard, a statue of 18th century pharmacist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier looked on.
 
Following on from last season, Kurogouchi deepened her theme of ‘Embracing’ with a collection that featured knitwear reminiscent of traditional woven baskets. Evolving from the delicate ‘Cocoon’ theme of summer 2020, the colour palette was deep and warm this season with hues resembling fallen leaves. All-black looks such as a sleek camisole dress and an elegant coat dress were followed by a white blouse and dress featuring embroidery using thick cord. When combined with dark brown textiles, the aesthetic was a sophisticated take on folklore.The collection featured Mame’s signature silhouette of dropped shoulders and long, flowing sleeves but also saw the addition of mini skirts and dresses. A light yet voluminous jacquard top was paired with macrame-style lace tights. For footwear, ankle boots, lace sling-back pumps, and sandals were produced in collaboration with Tod’s again this season. The sandals were created with Tod’s incorporate traditional Japanese kogin zashi quilting from the Aomori region into the brand’s traditional leather craftsmanship.
 
The show’s standout designs were a series of coats that featured linen lace woven like baskets in the finale. The lace, which was a key element of the collection, was created with hemp cords made by a shoelace manufacturer in Japan’s Kanto region which were sewn onto knitwear to create a uniquely constructed three dimensional effect. 
 
“I felt that I was embraced by the process of making clothes,” said designer Maiko Kurogouchi. “I want people who wear the clothes to share the same feeling.” Whilst remaining introverted and artisanal, the collection was truly conscious of the modern woman.
 
In November 2019, Kurogouchi founded a garment manufacturing business with Taro Horiuchi called Atelier Project. Although the project has just launched, it is pioneering a new approach to the garment production process ‘Made in Japan’.  
 
On March 6, Mame Kurogouchi plans to open its first flagship store in Tokyo, with the business appearing to be growing steadily.

"Feb 25, 2020","The coronavirus epidemic that has been raging in China and other parts of the world for several weeks heralded a reduced attendance by Asian visitors to the Paris Fashion Week, scheduled from February 24 to March 3. But further pressure is mounting following recent developments in northern Italy and notably Milan - where the local fashion week has just ended amidst some confusion, after the outbreak of hundreds of coronavirus cases in the region.On Monday, the various Paris Fashion Week stakeholders and participants, from the French Fashion Federation to labels, trade shows and showrooms, were waiting for fresh directives from the French authorities, which are working to prevent the epidemic's propagation into France. In terms of prevention, at the time of writing French policy-makers were not planning a curtailment to public meetings, affecting Paris Fashion Week events. On Monday evening, Health Minister Olivier Véran sought to reassure all concerned, saying that “no infected patient has been identified,” nor is there any evidence of “the virus spreading [in France] as of this evening.” He nevertheless emphasised that the relevant measures could be “reviewed and updated at any time.” The recommendations until then applicable to travellers coming from China, Singapore and, since Sunday, from South Korea, have now been extended to people travelling from the Italian regions of Veneto and Lombardy. They are to limit as much as possible any contact with the rest of the population, including staying away from public gatherings, working remotely and wearing protective masks.
 
In addition to the predicted shortfall in Asian visitors, the Paris Fashion Week is therefore likely to be impacted by a reduced presence of Italian buyers, including many who attended the Milan Fashion Week. Also, on Monday, a number of fashion industry companies introduced quarantine measures for their staff.Paris Fashion Week event organisers have confirmed that Chinese visitors will be virtually absent, and so will the majority of Korean ones. Also on the cards, a significant reduction in the number of visitors from Hong Kong and especially Japan. To be on the safe side, many Japanese fashion companies have decided to cut down on the number of employees travelling to Paris.
 
According to the Japanese External Trade Organisation (JETRO), only a minority of Japanese buyers are instead expected to cancel their trip, notably those from department stores, while the majority of multibrand buyers confirmed their attendance a few days ahead of the Fashion Week.
 
Antoine Floch, organiser of the Woman trade show, is expecting a reduced Japanese presence: “it seems that indeed the number of [Japanese] staff in attendance will be smaller, but this isn’t a one-off occurrence. Cuts to Japanese buyers’ travel budgets are an issue we have already been experiencing for several seasons,” said Floch. But the issue will surely be exacerbated this season by the coronavirus factor.
 
The Japanese contingent is a primary audience at the Paris Fashion Week, often closely followed by Italian buyers. And the latter’s presence in Paris for the Fashion Week's eight days is now a big question mark. While Parisian organisers have been able to monitor bookings from Asia over the course of several weeks, the outbreak of a plethora of coronavirus cases in areas close to Milan this week-end is too recent to allow organisers to predict how the situation will unfold.
 
Some Italian industry professionals are already in Paris, but they have been advised not to attend events, in compliance to the health measures in place. Others may have decided to remain in Milan. The French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation has duly published the government’s public health guidelines. No restriction on public meetings has so far been imposed, since only 12 coronavirus cases have so far been diagnosed in France, and there is no local outbreak hotspot.
 Events to be widely promoted, notably on social mediaIt is clear that both catwalk shows and trade shows are likely to be hit by a coronavirus effect in Paris this week. Organisers are planning to compensate for it by deploying a robust communication programme aimed at those buyers who won’t be able to attend the events. The French Fashion Federation is set to swamp social media platforms with content and show broadcasts, especially targeting Chinese platforms Weibo and Douyin.

WSN, organiser of the Première Classe show, which will open on February 28 like its Parisian counterparts, is hoping for a “limited” decline in the number of Japanese visitors - which account for 7.5% of its total - and is planning to broadcast a great deal of show-related content on WeChat, targeting its Chinese audience. China is the 10th country by number of visitors in the show’s ranking. And for Première Classe too there is a big question mark about the presence of Italian buyers, which account for 18% of the show’s regular visitors.
 
The Tranoï trade show, for which Italy ranks second among visitor countries, ahead of Japan, also expects a substantial impact. “We must urge exhibitors not to lose touch with those buyers who will not be able to attend this time,” said Boris Provost, the show's new director. “To do so, we can rely on the show's two new partners, online order-placement platform Joor and designer networking website Born. Their usefulness and complementarity with the show’s own digital tools is all the more evident,” he added.E-tail sites and virtual showrooms a must  
Online promotional and sales tools seem indeed to be a must this season, and they may well turn out to be winners. From Japan, JETRO said that “buyers who will not travel to Paris will utilise Skype and the virtual showroom platforms used by the labels they are interested in to place their orders. Whatever happens, they are trying to find a solution.”
 
Faced with a decline in attendance from Asia, the Milan Fashion Week opted for the same strategy last week, before its shows and events were disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak in Lombardy on Friday and Saturday. Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI), made this initial assessment of the attendance from Asia: “the Milan Fashion Week Women wasn’t too affected, since the crucial purchasing period is mostly beforehand, and many Chinese buyers were already [in Milan] for the Fashion Week Men, then went to Paris and back to Milan without returning to China. Besides, our platform for connecting with China during the Fashion Week had nine million subscribers.” In total, 16 million people are said to have viewed catwalk shows via Tencent and the ‘China We Are with You’ programme deployed by CNMI.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 25, 2020","Futurism in fashion generally looks old fashioned, with inevitable echoes of Pierre Cardin and Courrèges, though not at Marinne Serre, practically the only designer who manages to sculpt a vision of a foreign planet and style that seems plausible and cool. 
Serre has a dark yet beautiful conception of people “tumbling down into the futurist wormhole,” as she wrote in her program, of multiple generations embarking on an intergalactic voyage.
 
A bizarre mix of the familiar and the fantastic – all conditioned by our contemporary concerns. So, many models wore face and surgical masks, albeit made to match the houndstooth sci-fi governess dresses that were the heart of this show.Serre’s selection of fabrics was not all that revolutionary – fuchsia knit dresses; cotton djellabas; embroidered table cloth frocks; or faux fur bed-cover coats. But the results were often revolutionary. 
Staged inside Le Centquatre, a huge art space in a former factory at the top of Paris' 19th arrondissement, with a forbidding industrial soundtrack and lots of large darkened mirrors, the show was dark, yet not dystopian. The audience perched on low carpet-covered benches like polite hippies.
 
Worn by a cast that varied from veteran models to tiny tots and some colorful characters such as Reverend Sister-hoodie; hunter gatherers; or awakened sleepers. Many clad in the designers signature mini ball print, the leitmotif of all Serre collections.
 
Entitled Mind Mélange Motor this was a somewhat weird, often wacky, but ultimately rather beautiful fashion moment, and a reminder why Paris will always be the true center of the fashion universe.

"Feb 25, 2020","President Emmanuel Macron fêted fashion creativity with a gilded dinner inside the Élysée Palace on Monday night, praising the imaginative foreign elements in the industry, even as he picked out Frenchman Jean-Paul Gaultier for special praise. 
Several score of designers attended the soirée, the second organized by Macron and his wife Brigitte since he became president in May 2017. Some 200 guests enjoyed delicious French cooking – asparagus, scallops and chocolate cake washed down with white Mercurey 1er Cru 2018 from Domaine Michel Juillot, a 2009 Château Gazin from Pomerol and Jacquart Cuvée Alpha 2010 champagne.
 
“Brigitte and I are very happy to receive you at a moment when Paris again becomes the true capital of fashion,” said Macron before thanking France’s Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and its executive president Pascal Morand, “for the work they have done along with the family of brands and all the designers who join us.”“Even as you finish your final gestures and probably suffer from some stress (before your shows), tonight is a few instants of ease, innocence and forgetting,” said Macron on the opening evening of the nine-day French runway season.
 
Sitting at the president’s table of 16, Macron’s wife Brigitte was on his left, Gaultier on his right, Elie Saab, on top table, joining the likes of Olivier Rousteing, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Clare Waight Keller, Anna Wintour, Delphine Arnault, Bruno Pavlovsky, Simon Porte Jacquemus, Alexandre Mattiussi and Marie-Claire Daveu.
 
“There is also an extraordinary international dimension to fashion. Half of the designers here are non-French. That makes our fashion week a truly international event, even in this moment of anguish due to coronavirus,” the 42-year-old president said in French.
 
Dotted around 20 tables sitting underneath the gilded ceiling and giant chandeliers of the Salle des Fêtes state dining room were scores of designers: Alber Elbaz, Julie de Libran, Lutz Huelle, Haider Ackermann, Craig Green, Christelle Kocher, Stéphane Rolland, Agnès Troublé of Agnès B., Glenn Martens, Arnaud Vaillant and Sébastien Meyer, Nicolas Lecourt Mansion, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Rok Hwang, Daniel Roseberry and Thebe Magugu among others, a score or two of CEOs, including Séverine Merle of Celine and Nicolas Santi-Weil of Ami, and barely a dozen editors.

Three cabinet ministers also attended the soiree, underlining the government’s support for fashion. The Secretary of state for Economy and Finance Agnes Pannier-Runacher joined the senior LVMH executive Sidney Toledano and Naomi Campbell on another table. Close by Guillaume de Seynes of Hermes dined with Culture Minister Franck Riester along side Berluti’s Kris Van Assche. While the Secretary of State for Ecological Transition Brune Poirson was on a third table with Rick Owens and Pascal Morand.
 
Switching to very good English, Macron added: “Having you here today is the best evidence that Paris is still one of the main places of young design and eco-friendly design. This ability to have a permanent dialogue between different backgrounds and cultures is, I do believe, exactly what our world today needs […] That’s why it is so important to have this fashion week in Paris. You represent the ability to create. To respect each other. This tolerance, this creativity is why we are so proud to have this fashion week and to have you in this palace this evening,” he stressed.
 
The evening marked the high point of public support for fashion by a French government or indeed any nation in Western Europe. In London, 10 Downing Street and Buckingham Palace have organized cocktail receptions, though never such a dinner.  Italian premier Matteo Renzi did stage two major lunches in Milan during its season, though no Italian president has ever hosted the fashion world in the Quirinale Palace in Rome.
 
“Young designers can inspire the new generation. It is such a positive message. On top of that, on a daily basis, there is the Fashion Pact, which we launched with a lot of you to reduce emissions, as your sector is a major one when it comes to that,” he noted, adding that fashion had a duty to organize fashion weeks in a different way than 10 or 20 years ago in order to reduce carbon emissions. 
 
Macron was instrumental in encouraging Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault to put together a coalition of over 30 brands, working together to stop global warming, restore biodiversity and protect the oceans.
 
At the finale, Macron lauded Gaultier for his brilliant career and final show during the couture season in January. “A mixture of joy and melancholy. Though I wish that like Charles Aznavour you will be having final shows for the last 15 years of your career,” joked Macron to much applause.
 
“All of the greatest actresses and singers have been dressed by you. During 50 years you have also dressed cinema. So, let’s hope this is the beginning of a series of final Jean Paul Gaultier shows. You inspired so many designers who are here today due to your sense of liberty. A French phenomenon with his ability to disrupt and create and reinvent himself,” said Macron, dressed in a classic dark blue suit and tie.
 Mixing French and English as he ended his 17-minute speech, Macron’s voice became rather emotional, as he argued, “I want to believe that is what French style represents in this world and why we are so happy to be in Paris. And not just for the fashion week, but also for each time you want to be free to create. And, let me say, if I believe in one thing for our country it’s that it’s a place where people have a very special taste for freedom, creativity and innovation. And if one day you feel threatened in the ability to create that you would feel that France is still your place.”
 
“We are a formidably free country and to have all your talents here in France is to continue this force that is France,” he continued. “I say that to all our friends here no matter your nationality, American, Chinese or Irish, that being here and creating here makes you very special people and also French citizens,” he added to much applause.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 24, 2020","Super-high heels can free women, says legendary French shoe designer Christian Louboutin, who insists that wearing his towering six-inch stilettos is a ""form of liberty"".While some feminists see vertiginous heels as sexual enslavement, Louboutin believes the opposite -- even if it means women have to walk slowly and carefully in his iconic red-soled creations.

""Women do not want to give up wearing high heels,"" the designer told AFP before ""The Exhibitionist"", a retrospective of his 30-year career, opens in a Paris museum Wednesday.While Louboutin also makes trainers and flat shoes, he admitted that when it comes to the spike-heeled classics that made his name: ""I don't think about comfort when I design.""

""No shoe with a 12cm (5 inch) heel is comfortable... but people do not come to me looking for a pair of slippers,"" said Louboutin, who helped bring high heels back into fashion in the 1990s and 2000s.

They are not meant to be worn all the time, but super high heels allow women to express themselves and break free of crushing norms, he said.

""To be a woman is also about enjoying one's freedom to be feminine if you want. Why renounce (high heels) when you can have them and flats,"" he said.

- Not meant to be comfy -

""I don't want people to look at my shoes and say: 'They look really comfortable!' The important thing is that people say: 'Wow, they're beautiful!'""

Even if they can only totter around in their Louboutins, that is no bad thing, he told AFP.

If the shoes ""stop you running"", that is something ""positive"", he added.

Having learnt his art under Roger Vivier, the man who claimed to have invented the stiletto, Louboutin became a household name in the 1990s after Princess Caroline of Monaco fell for one of his first solo creations.

Pop stars from Madonna to Tina Turner and Jennifer Lopez were soon competing with half of Hollywood for fittings.

But even as some luxury brands like Dior, led by feminist designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, have taken an axe to towering heels, Louboutin insisted they still had their place.

""People project themselves and their stories into my shoes,"" he said, pointing to a particularly high pair of intricate lace boots called Corset d'Amour, embroidered with scenes of love-making.

Louboutin revealed his life-long fascination with heels was sparked when he was 10 years old and saw a sign banning the shoes at the Palais de la Porte Doree -- the museum now holding his retrospective.

""I started to draw them because of that sign,"" he said, which was put up to save the museum's parquet floors.

- Forbidden pleasures -

""I think the fact that high heels were forbidden played on the unconscious... there was also the mystery and the fetishistic side... the simple drawing of a high-heeled shoe is often associated with sexuality,"" he added.

Louboutin also credited the sign with plunging him into ""the universe of curves"" which was to shape his art.

And he insisted that is art was not just about making heels higher and higher.

He has also been working on making his shoes disappear into the wearer's leg in a series which he calls Les Nudes -- in a variety of skin colours -- as well as designs which lengthen the leg.

Other highlights of the often cheeky show, which runs until July 28, include a hologram of a shoe that turns into the burlesque star Dita Von Teese as well a series of Louboutin-sporting nudes shot by the American film director David Lynch.

Louboutin rejoices in the fact that his shoes have now become so iconic that his name has become a shorthand for luxury and sexiness, popping up in rap songs, films and books.

""Pop culture is neither controlled or controllable, so I am very happy about that,"" he added.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Feb 24, 2020","No city stages fashion and luxury presentations as succinctly as Milan, all the way through the past week, which ended with the city closing its doors dramatically on Sunday after the first deaths from the coronavirus in Italy.
 
Of course, the Italian fashion capital does host major league shows like Prada, Fendi, Versace and Armani but there are often twice as many presentations in any given day as there are runway shows. Many of them artfully staged and boasting great fashion. We caught up with a half-dozen fashion and luxury presentations, the last of which, Fila, happened on Sunday as this great Lombard city suddenly emptied.
 Plan C
One brand enjoying a quiet but very convincing build-up is Plan C, the fashion marque of Carolina Castiglioni.

For her fourth collection, Castiglioni staged a presentation inside a bizarre private garage, with a rotating circle to turn around cars, upon which stood a pair of models in elegant green crepe coats. Below them were carefully selected toys belonging to Carolina’s daughter Margherita. Spotlights projected the toys shadows magnified as a backdrop, like an Orson Welles work of film noir.A half-dozen models posed in tableaux capturing the brainy and self-assured elegance; selfless cap jackets; billowing white cotton shirts; or boyfriend coats with large contrasting buttons.

“A sophisticated urban fashion arsenal,” smiled the ever-elegant Carolina, daughter of a fashion legend – Consuelo Castiglioni, the former designer of Marni.

Plan C already has its own store in Japan, and several pop-ups happening or planned in Isetan in Tokyo, Bon Marché in Paris and Harvey Nichols in London. While in Korea it has signed a partnership with Samsung. Plus, already after barely two years of existence it retails in 130 doors worldwide, a highly impressive result. Then again, fashion is clearly in Carolina’s genes.

Valextra
We caught up with Castiglioni a day later at tony bag and luggage brand Valextra on Via Manzoni, the dorsal spine of central Milan. She was one of five creators – along with Sunnei, Massimo Alba, Arthur Arbesser and Double J - that each developed a couple of bags for Valextra, in a charming collab project.

Sunnei had the most impressive installation – a large high-tech crane that rose and fell revealing four variations on the Valextra Passepartout bag, done in their fetish mega stripes. While Massimo Alba staged his signature blend of retro rock records and art photography, along with a series of cool leather tags. Viennese-born Arbesser concentrated some very fine intarsia ideas, while Double J riffed on regional Italian silks. The brainchild of fashion editor JJ Martin, Double J even enjoyed a double-header season presenting a series of colorful looks, and some great totes, in a project with Acqua di Parma two evenings before.

While for Valextra, Carolina displayed its Iside Crossbody bag with a drawing by – guess who ? - her daughter Margherita.Trussardi
The night before, we caught up with the debut presentation of Elena Durazzi at Trussardi. In effect her beginning and end, as Trussardi now plans to change designers every season. Which, considering how good Durazzi’s clothes looked seems something of a pity. Her posh padded boleros; elegant velvet trousers; and a perfectly judged classic mannish Harris tweed suit were all very elegant.

She also tapped into the brand’s leather resources with astute deerskin coat-dresses without sleeves and beige leather military shirts, worn by a cast that stood or sat on classic Trussardi furniture inside a neo-classical Milanese apartment. While a beautiful black model played spiritual music on a Yamaha piano, in a graceful fashion allocution.
 
Roberto Cavalli
This troubled house presented a new collection for fall that was actually very chic, for men and women. Offbeat tiger print shirts for guys; and chiffon red leopard-print cocktails for girls. And some great Chesterfield coats for men and women.

Though the standout look was a blend of four different animal prints. A great hacking jacket in python-print leather; anaconda-print leather pants; a leopard-print chiffon shirt and tiger-print scarf.  Talk about a door-opening look!

For ladies, tuxedo shirts with cotton piqué breastplates made in tiger print and shown with tartan jackets were uber-Cavalli. All presented by a well-spoken Italian called Marco, after the PR scolded him for almost revealing his family name.

“Company policy is that no one in the creative team be named,” sniped the PR at the event, which was staged in the overly packed Mudec museum, and hence not the best example of how to display fashion.Aspesi

A highly laudable effort from Aspesi to create an entire collection out of recycled material suffered from one flaw. The clothes didn’t look very good. An oddly sad color palette; dull, bulbous silhouettes and some very ditzy-looking stockmen, with electric green and sky-blue hair combining to deliver a flop of a presentation. Surprising to see in Milan really.
 
Fila

A mysterious ice curtain greeted visitors in a former train station, where Fila staged its latest display on Sunday afternoon, even as the city rapidly emptied. Sneakers series displayed inside large blocks of ice; models mysteriously passing by on a moving catwalk; and groups of skateboarders and après-skiers posing like trophies inside giant Arctic tableaux all made for a great piece of Italian fashion theatrics.
 
Designed by Antonino Ingrasciotta and Josef Graesel, and inspired by Alpine legends like Reinhold Messner and Ingemar Stenmark the clothes had lots of zest, color and attitude. From the yellow and blue ski jacket that referenced Stenmark’s World Cup winning outfit to Messner in his Fila overalls after conquering Everest, the first person to do so without oxygen. 
 
With a DJ laying down some groovy tunes, it all underlined how Fila is suddenly uber hip again. As we said, ain’t nothing like a polished Milanese presentation for giving a brand a boost.

"Feb 24, 2020","H&M has teamed up with the Sydney-based activewear brand P.E Nation for its latest fashion collaboration.The retailer has announced the imminent launch of a sporty series featuring clothes, swimwear, undergarments and accessories, which is set to roll out worldwide from March 5.

The collection will focus on sustainable materials such as organic cotton and recycled polyester, and will span everything from leggings and t-shirts to bicycle shorts to sports socks, all with a retro aesthetic and streetwear edge. Color blocking and tie-dye patterns make for a bold, dynamic series built on a color palette of neutrals peppered with jolts of mint green, neon pink and bright orange.""With the H&M collaboration, we want women all over the world to live a more confident, vibrant, fashionable life whilst juggling her fast-paced urban existence,"" said Pip Edwards and Claire Tregoning, co-founders of P.E Nation, in a statement,

""The collection can be worn all day, every day, whilst being flexible, functional and style-led. All the pieces work so well together -- it's very easy to mix and match.""

""It's been a lot of fun collaborating with P.E Nation -- the teamwork and energy between them and our designers was great!"" added Maria Östblom, head of womenswear design at H&M.

""Pip and Claire know first-hand about the need for activewear in all aspects of daily life as female entrepreneurs and co-founders of such a dynamic lifestyle brand. They are fantastic role models and super inspiring themselves.""

"Feb 23, 2020","Got to hand it to Boss, they know how to stage a powerful show. Case in point, this Sunday in Milan, where a huge cast marched around an immense dais at the center of a looming fashion tent.On the dais, the indie orchestra led by French composer Henri Scars Struck, posed underneath a small regiment of stalactite lights. Bathed in the same lilac light as the custom-made auditorium and runway, they played some elegiac string-driven music that perfectly suited the rich quality of the fashion.
 
The sounds complimenting a very fine collection, which referenced the glory brand’s glory days of the 1970s, and also riffed on the 1920s -- a major trend this season.Multiple designers have been obsessed with the Roaring Twenties and one of its key signatures – fringes. Few more so than Hugo Boss chief brand officer Ingo Wilts, who finished charcoal gray felt dresses with fringes, and mannish business suits, cashmere scarves, fine wool tunics and woven leather bags; the latter seen in the very first look. Wilts concentrated on the glory days of Boss back in the 70s, when the brand defined the power silhouette of that era. And the result was one of the strongest Boss collections in many years.
 
In a co-ed show, crisp business suits, shiny leather great coats and snappy track pants for the boys; fluid silk mono-color cocktails, second-skin leather shirts and perfectly cut blazers for the gals.

Both sexes also got to wear broken zebra-pattern suits and double-breasted coats that had lots of panache. In a word, highly wearable clothes for the office or after-hours.
 “Our idea was cross-generation. So, pieces from our past mixed with the new. Our heritage business was very strong in the 70s and 80s. So our starting point was the ad campaigns of that era. Together with 20s and its fringes. Bringing back the past, but with freshness,” explained Wilts, still bearing the faint hint of a tan acquired at New Year’s vacation in the Philippines.

"Feb 22, 2020","As women and men are equal in life, so they are on the catwalk, nowhere more so than at Versace, as Donatella staged her first ever truly co-ed show as night fell on Milan.Guys and gals came out as couples or in small groups in her Fall/Winter 2020-21 show, often in exactly the same fabrics and colors, though never with the same outfit.
 
Having a deep-pocketed new owner clearly suits Donatella Versace, who staged a great, full-blown glamour show at Piazza Lina Bo Bardi, in a giant underground space underneath Milan’s Diamond Tower, located across the street from Versace’s new world headquarters in the booming Porta Nuova neighborhood.A thousand life-sized heads of Donatella greeted guests, projected onto a truly massive 80-meter-long and five-meter-high LED wall. Pre-show, the wall also projected the audience, distorting the editors, buyers and influencers like a show ground mirror. Then out walked the cast. Donatella has included men in women’s shows before, but never so equally. 
For next fall, Donatella has shortened skirts lengths, nipped in waists and produced a hyper linear collection. She opened with a blond couple in black technical gabardine suits, the girl wearing platforms with her skirt, the guy’s pants tucked into chunky heeled wellingtons. Skirt lengths were so high they were almost indecent, while red houndstooth blazers were cut like double-breasted mini dresses.
 
Breaking the pattern, she displayed some great some great mini A-line puffers and then wowed with a new computer-graphic zebra print used in cocktails, coats and men’s suits, all the while projecting the pattern onto the massive wall.
 
“What I’m trying to say with this collection is that sensuality comes through the brain first. The clothes become a means to an end. To me, hyper masculine is okay for menswear and hyper feminine is okay for womenswear,” explained the designer in a pre-show discussion with editors. 
Donatella emblazoned almost everything with Vs, from python bags and varsity jerseys to tracksuits and white socks, but she varyied her logo enormously.
 
“I focused on distorting the Versace baroque, making it more energetic and altering the shapes,” she concluded.
 
Outside the show space, the house had even installed yet another version of the V, a mighty 10-meter-high black and white letter sculpture celebrating the most powerful show by the blonde bombshell in a half decade.
 
However, in her pre-show discussion Donatella wanted to speak about a far more urgent matter.
 
“I wanted to talk about the rise of hate crimes that keep happening all over the world. We all have a strong voice. Myself as a designer and you as journalists. And we must use it. What happened in Germany two days ago was the last straw for me. We need to act and we need to be fast. We must not permit young people to feel that going back to the horror of the past is a good thing,” she said sadly.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2020","Following New York, London and Milan, Paris will bring the marathon for the women’s Fall/Winter 2020-21 ready-to-wear collections to a close against a troubled backdrop, especially due to the coronavirus epidemic that created a panic at the weekend in Milan, leading Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti to hold their shows behind closed doors with no audience. Nevertheless, the Paris Fashion Week that opens on Monday features a very rich programme, with 70 catwalk shows - they were 75 last season - and 26 presentations.Between February 24 and March 3, all the leading labels in French luxury fashion will take to the catwalk, from Chanel to Dior, Saint Laurent, Lanvin, Margiela, Balenciaga, Hermès, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton. Over 5,000 visitors are expected in the French capital, all keen to discover the trends and novelties for the next winter season.
 
Alongside the leading luxury labels, a series of newer, though by now established names - the next generation in Parisian fashion - are also expected to shine, like Off-White, Koché, Marine Serre, Lemaire and others. As they do every season, a plethora of Japanese labels will also be showing their collections in Paris: Mame Kurogouchi, Anrealage, Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, Junya Watanabe, Comme des Garçons, Sacai, Beautiful People and Junko Shimada.This season, a prestigious new name will join Paris’s Japanese community, Noir by Kei Ninomiya, another label spawned by the Comme des Garçons talent incubator. Ninomiya has a degree in French literature and studied at Antwerp's Royal Academy of Fine Arts, before upping sticks to join Rei Kawakubo in 2008, working as a model-maker. In 2012, he launched the Noir collection under his mentor’s aegis. Ninomiya is renowned for his sculptured artisanal constructions and for his work with materials and repetition effects. He will be showing for the first time on the official Paris calendar on Saturday February 29.
 
The Paris Fashion Week is constantly broadening its horizons, with a growing focus on Africa: on opening day, Monday, it will welcome Nigerian designer Kenneth Izedonmwen, showing with his label Kenneth Ize. Izedonmwen was one of the eight finalists of the LVMH Prize 2019, and his collection will also feature at the Sphere showroom. Born in Lagos, Izedonmwen grew up in Vienna, where he graduated at the University of Applied Arts before returning to his native Nigeria, where he founded Kenneth Ize in 2016. His colourful, destructured style blends African craftsmanship with a contemporary fashion vision.

More African fashion features in the programme with the presentation of the collection by South African designer Thebe Magugu, winner of the LVMH Prize 2019, also at the Sphere showroom, and on February 25 with the first, off-calendar show by Nigerian designer Idris Balogun for his label Winnie. Balogun was born in New York, grew up in London and worked at Burberry and Tom Ford before starting his solo career in 2018.As for emerging French labels, the spotlights will be trained on the show by Coperni, the label that Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant relaunched successfully last year. After two seasonal presentations, Coperni will stage its debut catwalk show on Tuesday February 25. It is an absolute first for the designer duo, which never showed even during Coperni's first active phase, between its inception in 2013 and 2015.

The other label set for a maiden Paris Fashion Week show on the official calendar is Gauchere, showing on Tuesday March 3. The Parisian ready-to-wear label, distinctive for its minimalist style, was founded by German designer Marie-Christine Statz, who grew up in Düsseldorf. After graduating at the Parsons School of Design in New York, and studying at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Statz cut her teeth at Narciso Rodriguez and Diane von Furstenberg, before launching her own label in 2013.

Another eagerly awaited show will be Kenzo’s, on Wednesday February 26. The label is making its Parisian catwalk come-back under new creative director Felipe Oliveira Baptista, who will unveil his first collection for Kenzo. Valentin Yudashkin, who will show on March 3, will also be making his come-back after a two-season absence.

These four new names and two come-backs will partly compensate this season’s loss of 11 labels, of which no fewer than four are due to the coronavirus epidemic. The problems, chiefly in terms of logistics, caused by the standstill which most business activity has been brought to in China, forced six Chinese labels to drop out. Among them, Masha Ma, Shiatzy Chen, Uma Wang and Jarel Zhan, all featured on the official show programme. Some of them, like Uma Wang, will nevertheless present their collections in a showroom.

The FHCM will put into place a specific framework on its social and digital channels for the designers unable to show or present. While visitors coming from Asia will be unable to attend the fashion week, the federation has planned to livestream ""on social media, including Weibo and Douyin, the shows and presentations of any labels registered on the official calendars who so wish (for the FHCM to do so),"" thus following in the steps of Milan Fashion Week which successfully implemented the same scheme. 

Rahul Mishra will stage a presentation and not a show, as the label now shows during the Haute Couture week. Courrèges will give this season a miss. The French label is without a creative director, following Yolanda Zobel’s departure after three seasons in charge.

Manish Arora has opted for a new presentation format. “We decided to produce a video and a photo shoot for the new collection, and they will both be released by email on February 27. It’s a different mode of expression. It’s more exciting to plan a statement event than to show the collection in five minutes, without giving the audience the chance to fully appreciate it,” the Indian designer told FashionNetwork.com. Arora promised to be back on the Parisian calendar next September with a “genuine show-performance.”
 Other absentees this season are Afterhomework, Cédric Charlier and the alternative London label by Chinese designer Yang Li. Korean label Moon Young Hee, not featured on the official programme for the last few seasons, will continue to show off-calendar. Aalto, the label by Finnish designer Tuomas Merikoski, dropped out of the calendar last September, and won’t be back this season.
 
It will be yet another very intense Paris Fashion Week however, with several parallel events, a plethora of presentations and some 20 off-calendar shows. Among the highlights, the relaunch of Hervé L. Leroux and the show by Guy Laroche, heralded as an unprecedented performance. Also, the screening, for a few sessions exclusively during the Paris Fashion Week, of the ‘Colette Mon Amour’ documentary film, chronicling the last six months in business of the renowned Parisian concept store.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2020","On Friday, Antonio Marras dazzled his Milan Fashion Week audience, showing a rich, eclectic collection, brimming with details, decorations and wonderful fabrics. It was also the opportunity for the Sardinian designer, together with his son Efisio, to relaunch his label’s menswear line in refreshed, relaxed fashion, and to introduce for the first time denim, revamped the Marras way. 
Last season, Marras drew inspiration from Japan, and this time he decided to delve into the history of another island nation, one equally far from his own world: Great Britain, seen through a 1980s perspective, hovering between a post-punk mood and new romanticism. “I was inspired by memories of a trip to London in my youth, and I blended that period’s wave of cheerful vitality with the ancient, primitive culture of my native Sardinia,” he told FashionNetwork.com backstage.
 
Using his talent as a storyteller, Marras imagined one of his magically skilful seamstresses travelling to London and falling in love with a very British sewing-machine manufacturer. Back in Sardinia, and having little familiarity with the infernal machines, the seamstress is completely overwhelmed, going crazy with stitches that twist, turn and zigzag all over the clothes she works on.The result is a lavish Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection that blends unselfconsciously all kinds of influences, creating finely crafted patchwork garments and notably drawing on the label’s archives of military-style fabrics and clothes. Off-the-shoulder dresses in flowery silk satin are worn with woollen check shirts. The pockets of a khaki canvas parka are inlaid on a tweed jacket. A damask overcoat slips over a pair of jeans.
 
Eco-goat fur and curly eco-shearling take over the oversize collars and the sleeves of some overcoats. They are also used to enhance jackets, and are layered over straight skirts, giving them more heft. As usual for Antonio Marras, knitwear plays a big part, with jacquard sweaters and panel-decorated cardigans.
 
The men's looks have a more everyday, easy-to-wear feel, with their baggy trousers and denim jackets. But the hoodie is cut from tweed cloth, and all the items are decorated and embroidered, like the flannel check shirt embellished with Swarovski crystals.The designer’s touch is evident also in the harmonious lace compositions, in the poetic patterns gracing some t-shirts and shirts, in the sumptuous removable collars which cover the shoulders and add volume to the garments, and in the Sardinian slogans hand-painted on sweatshirts and sport jackets.
 
“With menswear and denim, we’re also launching a footwear line with a new licensed partner, Gianni Gallucci,” said Efisio Marras, who is in charge of the I’M Isola Marras line, targeting a younger demographic and now available at 240 multibrand clients worldwide.

The main line, Antonio Marras, is instead distributed chiefly in Italy and Russia, through franchised monobrand stores with the Bosco di Ciliegi group. The label also recently inked a deal with Neiman Marcus for the USA.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2020","Just when you were tempted to entirely write off Benetton, along comes Jean-Charles de Castelbajac to inject a great blast of situationist style into the knitwear giant.This was the French designer’s third collection for the Italian brand and his most potent statement so far. In effect, he riffed on lot of his own inner DNA and the result was a combative and kicky collection.
 
Jean-Charles built a skate-park inside Milan’s main Pelotas court and invented a local team of boarders to perform, several racing up great Keith Haring ramps in between a series of mini shows that lasted through Thursday. The graffiti artist was one of seven themes that de Castelbajac played with, including colorful camouflage, funky tartans and wacky leopard prints.The co-ed cast marched across the giant colorful catwalk with deconstructed Haring print hacking jackets; long Clan Stewart puffers; tropical camouflage moon boots; suede Bambi jerkins; and even the Frenchman’s famous golden hippo-encrusted down jackets.
 
“I’ve been entrusted with a sleeping beauty and it has been a joy waking her up. There is an art to creating fashion at an affordable prices and I’m enjoying doing precisely that,” explained de Castelbajac. 
His arrival underlines the desire for change at Benetton, once the ruler of global fast fashion, especially in knitwear. This is far from a capsule show, since the entire collection will retail throughout the massive network of over 4,000 stores. Despite recent travails, the brand still turns over 1.3 billion euros.
 
“We hired Jean-Charles, quite frankly, to inject a fashion statement into our collections and he has certainly managed to do that,” explained Carlo Tunioli, Benetton’s general manager.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2020","Fashion, addicted to permanent change, likes few things more than a debut -- and it witnessed an impressive one Friday morning in Milan at Tod’s.With poise and a dash of aristocratic nonchalance, the brand’s new designer Walter Chiapponi presented his first women’s collection for Tod’s. And seconds after model Mariacarla Boscono made the final exit from the catwalk, the decision was rendered. Walter is a hit.
 
Too often before, Tod’s designers have served up stiff uptight clothes dominated with overwrought leather looks. Not Chiapponi, who concentrated on creating a highly plausible selection of understandable clothes. His opening look made his intentions clear – a classy lady with somewhat messy hair, who looked like she had crawled out of bed and thrown on the best pieces from her daddy’s wardrobe – a blue artist’s smock under a classical beige blazer worn with Pacific-blue corduroy pants that were way too long. On her feet, not Tod’s moccasins, but Stan Smith-style white sneakers. 
 
In fact, practically every pair of pants were a couple of inches too long, adding to the sense of insouciance. Often paired with a great series of top coats; again many rather mannish, and made of dry wools. And often pinched from the wardrobe of the gals’ father, or even granddad – like the marvelous matelassé coat on Kaia Gerber, nipped at the waist with a thin white belt. 
 
Chiapponi is naturally gifted tailor, whose sense of proportion is innately flattering. So when he played with proportions it all worked. Like the excellent sky blue leather apron dress paired with a dark oversized nylon flight jacket with billowing sleeves. Plus, there was an element of the Anglo Saxon intellectual in Tuscany that also resonated – with some great speckled tweed suits and checked jumpsuits. Savile Row on the Arno. Even the one male model in the show was an Englishman. The at-ease styling was by another Briton, Katie Grand, adding the ideal dose of detachment. 
 
“I wanted to make a complete wardrobe, staring with lifestyle pieces - trench-coats, pea-coats and biker jackets. I don’t like anything too overdesigned. And I wanted an aristocratic look to the models but with an edge,” explained Chiapponi.
 
The plush mood was emphasized by the seating – a series on soft velvet benches and a carpeted runway. Even the logo was revamped in a large alcove, with a huge golden 'T' backlit and placed on a red velvet wall.
 
Chiapponi’s finale did indeed feature leather – most notably Boscono’s edgy patchwork leather coat, made from recycled scrap shoe leather from the factory.  A nod to sustainability and a neat way of finishing an accomplished debut collection. Expect to hear lots more about Chiapponi. He would appear to have plenty of staying power.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 21, 2020","If one had to sum up the spirit of the Fendi collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21 in a few words, the expression ""an iron fist in a velvet glove"" would seem to do the trick. Playing with contrasts between strength and softness, rigour and romanticism, austerity and sensuality, creative director Silvia Venturini Fendi articulated a reflection on the many nuances of a woman's soft power, oscillating between martial authority and high seduction to bring this duality right up to date. The show was one of the highlights of Milan Fashion Week on Thursday. For once, the house completely changed its decor, having its models walk on the cosy carpet of a powder pink boudoir decorated with plush sofas. On the runway, curvy women rubbed shoulders with top models such as Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber and Mariacarla Boscono, among others – a situation unlikely to have occurred in the times of Karl Lagerfeld. 
 
But times have changed, Fendi seemed to be saying with this collection, proposing a varied but delicately balanced wardrobe that revealed a meticulous attention to proportion, construction, material and detail. Almost all of the looks were presented in monochrome grey or pale pink versions, but there were also accents in warmer shades, as seen in a handful of burnished leather or golden yellow ensembles. Representing strength, the collection included a number of military coats with bulky, all-enveloping proportions, as well as austere retro-style dresses. More feminine elements included the structure of a corset which appeared to have been embossed onto a series of garments tailored in luxurious wool, cashmere or thick leather, emphasising the models' busts, while elsewhere cocoon-like volumes and rounded curves dominated. 

The jacket and knee-length skirt combo was also back with a vengeance, as shown by a leather version featuring a pleated maxi skirt, or a combed wool number with a Paisley motif that seemed to be imitating leopard print. Sensible dresses with short sleeves and shirt collars alternated with leather biker outfits.  
The silhouette was generally cinched at the waist by belts decorated with miniature electronic gadgets, such as smartphone earpieces, tablet stylos and smartwatches, all placed inside metallic golden cases hanging from chains. Other accessories included oversized bags and little cases which echoed the shape and design of the bags distributed in Fendi boutiques and will no doubt be a hit. 

On the softer side of things, sensuality positively oozed from a pink satin blouse, unbuttoned to reveal the model's bra, as well as from black dresses in transparent chiffon, lace skirts and a selection of fringed ensembles. Fendi's sophisticated lady also donned long leather gloves, wore her hairband on the back of her head for a futuristic touch and, in a sexy twist, switched her garters for a man's sock suspenders. 

The collection's key element, however, was puffed sleeves, which were placed a little lower on the shoulder, thereby accentuating the volume around the models' arms. They popped up everywhere, on coats, dresses, certain oversized jackets, furs and even on soft cardigans and baggy ribbed pullovers. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 20, 2020","After a three-year absence, Emilio Pucci has made a powerful catwalk come-back under the mischievous direction of Christelle Kocher. The Italian luxury label has been without a creative director since 2017, following the departure of Massimo Giorgetti. This season, Emilio Pucci is ushering in a new approach, calling on external designers to reinterpret its archives. The first of them was French designer Christelle Kocher, who injected a hefty dose of her couture streetwear into the Florentine label’s chic, mildly flippant aesthetic.The event was surely one of the most eagerly awaited of the Milan Fashion Week. Even though it featured only in the presentation programme, it attracted all the Italian fashion industry heavyweights, from the President of the Italian Fashion Chamber Carlo Capasa, to the boss of Pitti Uomo, Raffaello Napoleone. Also spotted in the front row was the CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, Sidney Toledano, in charge of numerous prestigious brands owned by the luxury group, among them Emilio Pucci.
 
The Koché revolution was palpable as soon as one stepped into the small deconsecrated church of San Paolo Converso, the show's venue. The audience was greeted by two stands where it was possible to customise the collection's t-shirts, by wall-to-ceiling video screens and holograms, and by an installation with a VR headset which offered an advance 3D preview of some of the looks.A unique welcome, to clearly emphasise that Emilio Pucci is entering a new era. Songs by US rapper Lil Uzi Vert did the rest, the ideal soundtrack for this energetic show, hovering between a rave party and a jet-set gala evening. In a sign of change, for the first time male models trod the catwalk together with Emilio Pucci girls. And another first: jeans made their appearance in the label's wardrobe.
 
The models strutted energetically around the room, taking a spiralling path up a multi-level structure, creating a constant impression of movement on the set. A succession of dark ladies in glam gloves and black glasses with white pearl necklaces hanging down to the navel, of chic ladies wearing mini-dresses and cute orange wool overcoats, of sporty girls in glossy track suits embroidered with lace and pearls, of young women in flowing outfits, from t-shirt dresses to oversized polos worn over midi slit skirts or silk Bermuda shorts.Kocher delved into the Emilio Pucci archives, borrowing prints, patterns and fabrics, which she then blended with gusto to modernise the label’s wardrobe, introducing a sombre colour palette brightened by a few vivid hues. The signature Emilio Pucci silk scarf cropped up in various guises: as a headscarf, tied around the thigh like a garter, worn cross-shoulder to hold up a pair of glasses, transformed into handbags, spilling out like a bouquet of flowers from the back pocket in a pair of jeans, or as a check print on a t-shirt.
 
A sporty chic vibe coexists with a very sexy boudoir mood, with thin-strapped silk jumpsuit dresses in bold colours, either embroidered or trimmed with lace, while bodysuits are left unbuttoned and worn over a pair of trousers. Lace tights, in black or fluorescent colours, are ubiquitous. The same lace decorates the shoulders and sleeves of a sweatshirt, or takes over an open-work maxi dress.
 
While infusing fresh zest into Emilio Pucci, Christelle Kocher added her own couture expertise, notably in some statement items like a dress, a top and a parka covered in feathers and decorated with pearls. “I’m bringing freshness and energy to Emilio Pucci. At the same time, the craftsmanship involved is incredible. I wanted something very feminine and soft, but also to inspire confidence with a few unisex items,” Kocher told FashionNetwork.com after the show.
 
According to the founder's vigilant daughter, Laudomia Pucci, image director and vice-president of the label, the exam was passed with flying colours. “Christelle Kocher’s interpretation is highly innovative. She has worked a great deal on the archives, translating them into her own lexicon in a contemporary way. The result is vibrant, amusing, very easy to grasp and at the same time sophisticated,” said Pucci.

"Feb 20, 2020","A prestigious New York fashion college apologized on Wednesday after a catwalk featuring models wearing large prosthetic red lips, ears and bushy eyebrows was branded racist.The president of the Fashion Institute of Technology said it was investigating the use of the accessories in the February 7 show, which was part of New York Fashion Week.

Joyce Brown said it had not been the creator's intent to make a statement about race but ""it is now glaringly obvious that has been the outcome.""For that, we apologize -- to those who participated in the show, to students, and to anybody who has been offended by what they saw,"" she said in a statement emailed to AFP.

The show made headlines after African-American model Amy Lefevre, 25, told the New York Post tabloid that she had refused to wear the props because they were ""clearly racist.""

In a statement posted on Instagram, Jonathan Kyle Farmer, chairman of the fashion design program which ran the show, apologized directly to Lefevre.

The controversy comes after Italian fashion house Prada said earlier this month it would take steps to fight racism and promote diversity following uproar over its sale of monkey-like key chain figurines.

Prada was forced to apologize in December 2018 after it featured so-called ""Pradamalia"" objects that had exaggerated red lips and evoked blackface caricatures in its New York store.

Critics said the merchandise -- which was pulled from shelves following the outcry -- resembled Sambo, a racist caricature that reinforced negative stereotypes about America's black community.

The problematic custom of blackface dates back to about 1830, and so-called ""minstrel shows,"" when white performers caked their faces in greasepaint or shoe polish and drew on exaggerated lips.Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Feb 20, 2020","Ours is not a minimalist era.  Instagram has long ago blunted the yearning for restraint and discretion. Yet, rather remarkably, the design duo of Lucie and Luke Meier have managed to make the house of Jil Sander, the minimalist fashion brand par excellence, seem – indeed be – really relevant again. 
That much was abundantly clear after their poetic show staged in the latest revamped giant industrial space to be rediscovered in Milan by the fashion industry.
 
This collection’s flowing shapes, pristine fabrics and graceful silhouettes all combined in a moment of charm and refinement: a show where the entire cast of 54 marched around two lines of classic wooden office chairs before each took a seat.“What’s important to us is movement. To display the clothes’ lightness and sensuality when they walked,” said Lucie in the backstage.
 
“Even winter wools can feel supple,” added husband Luke.
 
Everything, including a simple one-button blazer and a side-split chenille wool skirt, looked refreshed. Though the key element was a series of capes – from a cashmere mohair version over a ribbed column, to a beautiful ecru Reverend Mother dress in taffeta, finished with a mantle.
 
“For us it is not about minimalism, more about the approach. It has to be right in the zeitgeist.  We really wanted to keep the models in the room, so people could spend more time with them. Besides, sitting down is part of life,” argued Lucie.
 
Adding to that sense of seeing the clothes differently, the backstage look board showing each passage also featured the back of each model. Practically unheard of in most backstages. “Why not? It’s important!” insisted Luke.
 A former electricity generating plant, located on Via Bramante, the massive all-white space chosen for the show was the ideal setting for this Fall 2020 collection. Named after Donato Bramante, one of the greatest architects of the High Renaissance, who created the original concept for St Peter’s Basilica in Rome, today the street on which the plant stands is lined with discount Chinese clothes stores. However, this collection would surely have pleased Donato, with his love of perspective and harmonious lines.
 
“The original plant has been drastically renovated and will eventually become a design museum. So we just kind of snuck in in the middle,” laughed Luke, summing up the optimistic mood of the show.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 19, 2020","The 60th anniversary celebrations for Dr. Martens' Original 1460 boots are continuing with the presentation of a reworked version of the model by Belgian designer Raf Simons. The punk-styled limited edition boots will go on sale on February 22.To celebrate the six-decades-long success of its Original 1460s, Dr. Martens has invited 12 world-renowned designers and labels to create limited edition versions of the iconic British boots, which will be presented at a rate of one drop per month throughout 2020. Hot on the heels of the Japanese streetwear label BAPE in January, Raf Simons has now unveiled his personal interpretation of the boots that became a streetwear legend.

The decision to call on Raf Simons was not taken by chance, the Belgian designer has regularly collaborated with Dr. Martens for more than a decade, so it was natural that he should participate in celebrations for 60 years of the Original 1460s.In a punky design, which reflects his anti-conformist spirit as well as the Dr. Martens brand heritage, Raf Simons has adorned the smooth leather uppers of the 1460s with nickel rings, and an embossed Dr. Martens x Raf Simons logo.

The limited edition model will be available from February 22 in selected stores and on-line from Drmartens.com.

"Feb 19, 2020","Does fashion have a purpose today? This question ran through the first day of shows at Milan on Wednesday, each designer providing their own answer to it or proposing possible paths forward. In particular, Calcaterra sent out an extremely pared-down collection, while Marco Rambaldi designed for women free from all social diktats, and Gilberto Calzolari went all in with a truly ecologically responsible approach. 
 The winner of the Oscars of eco fashion, Green Carpet, in 2018, Calzolari opened proceedings on Monday with what he defined as a ""denunciation runway."" Calling into question the frenzy of overproduction that currently plagues the industry, as well as the avalanche of fashion imagery continually poured out by social networks, the designer's models walked through a set surrounded by screens, stopping suddenly partway down the catwalk, as though inviting the audience to pause for thought. 
 
""It's an invitation to reflect on the crazy world we live in, caught between fake news and the climate emergency,"" explained the designer, who at 45 can boast of experience at some of the biggest fashion houses around, including Marni, Alberta Ferretti, Valentino and Miu Miu.After 10 years at Giorgio Armani, Calzolari, then 40, decided to take a step back in order to adopt a more responsible approach to fashion. In 2015, he founded his own eponymous label, where all the clothes are made using what the designer calls ""forgotten fabrics"" that have been reclaimed from stocks, as well as new responsibly manufactured technical textiles. He also recycles unusual materials to make couture fabrics, as in the case of a lightly ruched top and skirt at this season's show, constructed using the material from umbrellas. 

Elsewhere, coat-dresses with large buttons were elevated with removable collars in cosy plush in a variety of bold shades, while fine organza tunics were worn over skirts with maxi sequins. The overall silhouette was chic, contemporary and feminine, playing with contrasts between structured and fluid cuts. Colourful inserts were harmoniously slipped into patchwork pieces featuring stripes, houndstooth and Prince of Wales check. 
  
Calcaterra chose the same direction and took it to the extreme. Accompanied by the strains of a string quartet, models walked in slow motion and in extremely close proximity to the audience. ""I wanted to make an intimate, absolutely pure collection with a neutral palette and natural materials that have been treated as little as possible,"" stated Daniele Calcaterra, who took his inspiration from John Cage's 4′33″, a composition consisting of four minutes and 33 seconds of silence. 

With his own sartorial composition for next winter, the designer transformed silence into music. Each piece seeming to be an essential element of the collection: the all-enveloping pull-over, the corduroy trousers, the loose distressed jeans, the white cotton shirt, the draped dress and the coat – a key element in Calcaterra's wardrobe, interpreted as a mohair robe, a parka with a maxi fur-lined hood and even as a billowing cape. 

Heavy throws in felted wool were transformed into skirts, shawl-tops or long tunics. Everything gave off a feeling of comfort and natural elegance, where women's and menswear fused effortlessly. All of the pieces on the runway were monochrome and devoid of the least embellishment. Disregarding a smattering of all-black looks, the palette ranged from off white to beige, via a fleshy pink. 
 Over at Marco Rambaldi, the designer had made clothes for a liberated woman ""who refuses the labels that society wants to impose on her"" and expresses her own identity. Born in Bologna, Rambaldi has always taken his inspiration from 1970s protest and underground culture. This season, the designer continued in the same vein, presenting an inclusive gender-fluid womenswear wardrobe, a message underlined by the participation of transgender actress and singer Eva Robin's in the show, along with the presence of a handful of menswear pieces. 
 
Here the devil was in the detail. A pale pink jacket and coat were quilted with embossed hearts, a motif that could also be found crocheted onto long, slender dresses. One tightly fitted dress in electric blue was cut with a generous décolletage, while skirts were slashed with two slits up the front. 

A black hand-knitted hoodie was decorated with long white drawstrings and the slogan ""altre libertine"" (other libertines). Silk slip dresses were paired with cardigans and featured prints recalling old grandma-crocheted tablecloths, patterns that were also used in long dresses with cut-outs.
 
A specialist in knitwear, the designer sent out a series of beautiful jacquard pullovers that picked up on the iconography of the 1970s, with certain images being incorporated into the backs of jackets, like posters. This season Rimbaldi too was concerned with the quality of his thread and fabrics, which were all recycled from other materials by an Italian company.

"Feb 19, 2020","You can’t keep a good man down, in life, in fashion and certainly not in Milan, where Alessandro Dell’Acqua celebrated the 10th anniversary of his brand N°21, with a salutary sophisticatedly sexy show.In that decade Dell’Acqua has won a reputation for making exotic and suggestive clothes that manage not to cross the frontier into cheap or vulgar. And this excellent fall-winter 2020 collection maintained that sterling tradition.
 
Back in the Noughties, this Neapolitan designer lost control of his own name, but where most creators would have thrown in the towel, Dell’Acqua went back to work with gusto, and gave birth to N°21, one of Milan’s most loved brands. And one that broke the psychologically important 50-million-euro annual turnover barrier a couple of years ago.The N°21 woman is an admirable gal. Very likely gym-attending; confident in her career; energetic and vey definitely sensual. For fall, Alessandro wants her to wear neatly rouched cocktails; guipure lace dresses or crocheted cardigans – all in black and finished with abstract fine metal bullion embroidery. He paired military coats and feathered redingotes with gentle, sky-blue mannish striped shirt dresses – to win a huge cheer at the finale of the show staged inside a raw Milanese garage that is his headquarters.
 When his lady wants to make an entrance she throws on beige marabou feather cocktails – racy robber baron mistress style; or a deep-gorge cappuccino silk evening gown with a neckline trimmed with hefty golden chains. The same trim used on sling-backs, purses and clutches. And featured heavily on the designer’s Instagram account pre-show.
 
“It’s all my obsessions in N°21 since the beginning rolled into one show. The punks; the Milanese bourgeois; the masculine-feminine element; the sexy; all the obsessions but not nostalgic, and not celebratory, because I really don’t like that,” smiled Dell’Acqua before fellow designers Andrea Incontri and Francesco Scognamiglio embraced him in compliments.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 19, 2020","On Tuesday evening, the Milan Fashion Week brought up the curtain on the ready-to-wear catwalk shows for the Fall/Winter 2020-21 with an event dedicated to China. Local authorities and national politicians, as well as the representatives of the Italian fashion industry, came out in force to express their unambiguous solidarity with the Asian country, hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic. 
As the audience took over La Permanente, a neo-classical palazzo and exhibition venue and also the new headquarters of the Milan Fashion Week, each guest was given a badge bearing the phrase ‘China We Are With You’, the slogan of the campaign in support of China launched by the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI) on Tuesday night.
 
The slogan was also featured on huge posters put up in the building’s various halls. During the Fashion Week, La Permanente is hosting several catwalk shows, as well as the Fashion Hub Market, a showroom focusing on emerging designers, from China in particular. Though not exclusively so, as it also showcases a cohort of emerging labels from Italy, Hungary and Africa.At the start of the evening, CNMI President Carlo Capasa, Italy’s under-secretary for foreign affairs Ivan Scalfarotto, and Milan city councillor Cristina Tajani, in charge of labour, business and manufacturing policies, including fashion and design, gave speeches in English to reaffirm their commitment in support of China.
 
Scalfarotto notably underlined that China is “a very important partner for Italy,” and said he deeply regretted the lack of Chinese visitors in Milan this week. Usually, about 1,000 between buyers, journalists and designers from China come to Milan for the Fashion Week, but nearly 80% of them were unable to travel this time because of the coronavirus. 
 During the fashion week, CNMI is planning to broadcast video conferences and other content on the various shows, to enable the fashion aficionados and professionals who had to remain in China to experience more closely the Fashion Week atmosphere.
 
The evening then continued with the show by Han Wen, one of the eight emerging labels selected for the Fashion Hub Market this season, thanks to the support of Chinese retail giant Chic Group, via its Sino-Italian Fashion Town platform. The other labels are Xun Ruo, Leaf Xia, Pinhui Zhao, Emma Sweet, Zijue, Dot Minute and Shengyi Liu.
 
Wen is a young designer born on southern China’s Hainan Island, keenly interested in model-making. He launched his label in 2016 in New York, after moving there to study at the Parsons School of Design. For next winter, Wen has created a series of sexy, power-woman looks, featuring shiny patent-leather thigh-high boots, trouser suits and miniskirts tasselled with golden and silver chains in pure 80s disco mood, or dark velvet overcoats cinched at the waist by colourful belts.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 19, 2020","Lee Alexander McQueen, the founder of the Alexander McQueen fashion house, will go down in history as one of the most famed and innovative fashion designers of his lifetime, making his original designs equal parts works of art and historical artifacts. At the New York Historical Society, fans and collectors alike had the opportunity to see some of McQueen's rarest one-off works, as part of a three-day pop-up.Held from February 14 through 18, the pop-up featured two dozen of the British fashion icon's critically acclaimed early designs from 1994 to 1996, including his 'Bumster' trousers, pieces from his controversial 'Highland Rape' collection, and pieces from his famed and surreal Autumn/Winter 1996 'Dante' show, which rocketed McQueen to international stardom. 

After the pop-up's close, the collection will be auctioned on February 22 in Boston by Bobby Livingston from RR Auction, who organized the installation. The pieces were curated by owner Ruti Danan, a colleague and former McQueen studio member, and Alexander McQueen archivist, John Matheson. Preceding the pop-up's public opening, the New York Historical Society held a private preview of the collection of McQueen pieces on February 14, complimented by the Society's surrounding artifcats and champagne.

Attendees included artist Andres Serrano, collectors Colby Mugrabi, Natalya and Nicolas Poniatowski and Lori Chemla, photographer Antoine Verglas, actor Jemima Kirke and her partner, musician Alex Cameron, model Cristina Kruse, architect Charles Renfro, and designer Dapper Dan, among others.

"Feb 18, 2020","People keep calling for designers to look into the future, but rarely has a season been so obsessed with the past as London Fashion Week, which wrapped up Tuesday night with a reception in 10 Downing Street.Designers often reference history, but this season they mined the past more obsessively than ever before. Most especially in the major statement shows of the week – Preen, Erdem and JW Anderson.
 
Erdem referenced The Age of Silver, working closely with Robin Muir, curator of Bright Young Things, an exhibition of early photography by Cecil Beaton, held in the National Portrait Gallery. Also the location of this show referenced the young aristocrats of 1920s London, which so fascinated the tabloid press of the era. It made for a marvelous series of looks at Erdem, by its designer Erdem Moralioglu. The latest collection by the Turko-Canadian creator to stem from the gilded age of Anglo-Saxon gentility, and all the better for it.Stupendous pearl encrusted mannish blazers; black jacquard sexy suits; frou frou flapper dresses – many looks topped by giant marabou feather plumage. On top of that, the excellence of draping and rouching were the latest reminder that here in the UK, Erdem is the nearest thing to haute couture one can find.

Jonathan Anderson also harked back to the 1920s with the most acclaimed show of the five-day London season. A day earlier, Preen referenced Don’t Look Now, the 1973 psychological occult thriller, about a couple searching for their dead child in Venice.  Mingling the checked jackets of the architect played by Donald Sutherland and the gilded theatrical costumes worn by Venetian nobility. The Preen duo of Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi cut with abandon, combining black ruffle dresses worthy of the Festa del Redentore with white virginal smock tops.  And wowing with dresses that combined golden vestments and Argyle sweaters.Add singer to the list of designer Hussein Chalayan’s professions. Chalayan went on a fashionable Aboriginal “walkabout” of his own life and ideas, in a show where he also sang and wrote the lyrics to four original tracks. Accompanied by producer Mark Moore and keyboard player Dan Donovan inside the famed dance theater, Sadler’s Wells. His off-beat draping and dark theatrical style, a charming reminder of Chalayan’s exceptional skill as a designer, in a blast from his own past.
 
On Sunday, the reigning queen of London volume, Roksanda Ilincic staged a brilliant piece of Cultural Re-appropriation. Inviting British-Bangladeshi artist Rana Begum to install No. 976 Net, a massive fabric installation that referenced fishermen and their net found in Cornwall and Bataan. Staged inside the Durbar Court of The Foreign & Commonwealth Office, a beautiful 1866 structure riddled with architectural lifts from the Indian sub-Continent. The result was a thrilling show – with bravura color blocking; raw outerwear; cascading volumes with multiple layering and technical cotton taffeta with hand painted brushstrokes.
 
Every single day in London, long-time European residents working in the fashion industry bragged with relief to FashionNetwork.com that they had managed to achieve settled status from British immigration authorities. So, it seemed fitting for the Serbian-born Roksanda that she staged her show inside the Foreign and Commonwealth office,  located right next door to Downing Street.

Across Green park, Irish-born Simone Rocha showed inside Lancaster House, which doubles for Buckingham Palace in the Netflix series, The Crown. A frequently beautiful display of dresses which used elements of baptism clothes, birthing smocks and Aran sweaters this was a collection of great charm, though not of that much news. It felt like a designer – however poetically – treading over already visited ground.In fashion, one always has to admire a veteran, and there are few more venerable designers than 74-year-old Paul Costelloe, who staged a polished performance inside the Art Deco ballroom of the Waldorf Hotel.
 
His big idea was a great one – high-tech body suits and leggings in graphic techy stain glass colors, worthy of Mark Rothko. Worn – on the way to the gym - underneath elongated Scottish tweed of Italian fine wool coats, the look was definitely spruce. 
 
Costelloe cuts a tad too generously – with one too many highwayman collars and bouffant puff sleeves; especially his jacquard evening wear. But that is clearly what his fans most admire. So, when Paul took his ovation down the carpet steps of the ballroom he won an enormous cheer, beaming and bowing before slowly leaving the runway, the applause still ringing.

"Feb 18, 2020","Veteran Irish designer Paul Costelloe said he got the idea for his new collection as he watched women heading to the gym every morning in London, wearing trainers and other comfortable gear.On Monday, the 74-year-old sent models down the London Fashion Week catwalk wearing wool coats and skirts, worn over tight, printed body suits.

“Is it fashion? No. Is it in fashion? Yes,” the designer said at the launch of his Fall/Winter 2020 line at London’s Waldorf Hilton hotel.“This is a collection very much of the woman going to the gym in the morning before she goes to work,” he told Reuters.

Yellows gave splashes of brightness to an otherwise muted palette of greys, blacks and shades of blue – colours Costelloe said represented the winter weather in London.

Dresses came with puffed sleeves and flower prints and were accessorised with large statement earrings.

Sparkly golden jackets and short or mini skirt combos were offered as an evening wear option.

Monday marked his 35th appearance at the London event. Costelloe said he had many more shows in him.

“The only person I’m happy to ever look at is Giorgio Armani because he is ten years older than me, he is still working, not looking great, but still working so I’ll follow in Giorgio Armani’s footpath and keep going,” he said.

Costelloe has a firm celebrity following but the designer said one stood above everyone else.

“The first celebrity was Princess Diana. She was stunning. She was such a pleasure to dress,” said Costelloe, who served as a personal designer to the late princess.

"Feb 18, 2020","Irish designer Richard Malone has been chosen from among ten finalists as the winner of the 2020 International Woolmark Prize, while the U.S.’s Bode took home the inaugural Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation. 
Held at London Fashion Week, the final of this year’s competition tasked each finalist with presenting a six-look capsule collection in Merino wool, which, for the first time in the prize’s history, also had to be completely traceable.
 
The finalists, who have all participated in an education and mentoring programme provided by the The Woolmark Company’s Innovation Academy, also had to present sustainability roadmaps and use technology from Woolmark partner Provenance in their collections.Malone took inspiration from his upbringing in Wexford, Ireland to create his collection, eliminating chemicals traditionally used in the dyeing process in order to minimize its impact on the environment.
 
Collaborating with weavers in Tamil Nadu, India, the designer combined 100% organic, plant-based dyes with Merino wool and other conscious fibres, as well as more recent innovations, to create a capsule promoting a circular fashion system.
 
“Winning the Woolmark Prize is completely unexpected,” commented Malone. “It means we can continue working with this supply chain and share our learning with other brands and designers. It also opens up the dialogue of fashion so more people can be part of it. Thank you to Australia’s woolgrowers for growing this incredible fibre.”
 
As for Emily Adams Bode, whose Bode brand was also a finalist for the LVMH Prize in 2019, the Atlanta, Georgia-born designer chose to use deadstock fabrics found in abandoned factories for her collection, which won her the Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation.
 
Adams Bode received her prize from Carine Roitfeld, founder and editor-in-chief of CR Fashion Book, and a long-time friend and collaborator of the late, great German designer, who won the coat category of the Woolmark Prize in 1954.
 
Adams Bode and Malone’s prize wins have earnt them awards of AU$100,000 (approximately US$65,000) and AU$200,000 (around US$130,000), respectively. Along with their fellow finalists, they will also be presented with commercial opportunities through The Woolmark Company’s Retail Partner Network.
 
Aside from Malone and Adams Bode, the prize’s finalists in 2020 included the UK’s A-Cold-Wall – also a finalist of the LVMH Prize in 2018, South Korea-based Blindness, Botter from the Netherlands, and Fang Chen Wang, based in China and the UK. Germany’s GmbH, France’s Ludovic de Saint Sernin, U.S.-based Matthew Adams Dolan, and Belgium’s Namacheko rounded out the selection.  
 
The panel for this year’s final was made up of Tim Blanks, Hamish Bowles, Sinead Burke, Edward Enninful OBE, Kim Jones, Takashi Murakami, Holli Rogers, Anja Rubik and Shaway Yeh.

The collections produced by this year’s Woolmark Prize finalists are expected to be commercially available in September 2020.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2020","After New York and London, it will be Milan’s turn on the fashion week stage. Starting on Tuesday 18, this fashion week will introduce a well-balanced programme combining leading names and emerging talents, with a strong focus on China, alongside other labels from all over the world. For the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI), the event is an opportunity to express its support for China, hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic.
 A young Chinese designer, Han Wen, will kick off the week with his show on Tuesday February 18. Born in south China's Hainan Island, Wen is passionate about materials research and model-making. He launched his label in 2016 in New York, after moving there to study at the Parsons School of Design.

The week’s opening night also marks the launch of the ‘China We Are with You’ campaign, and of the Fashion Hub Market, a section dedicated to emerging names, which will introduce the work of several Chinese designers. Alongside them, a cohort of emerging labels from Italy, Hungary and Africa will also be featured.The Milan Fashion Week, dedicated to the women’s ready-to-wear collections for the Fall/Winter 2020-21, features a rather reduced programme, with just one event on the first day and only two shows on the last day, Monday 24. However, there will be a spate of special events organised in parallel with the official calendar.
 
The programme of off-calendar events includes several shows, notably the catwalk come-back after a three-year absence of Emilio Pucci, which will unveil the collection by French designer Christelle Kocher on Thursday 20. Also worth mentioning, the show by Italian-Chinese label Maryling on Wednesday 19, as well as a collective show by Hungarian designers and the Luisa Spagnoli show, both on Friday 21.
 
Altogether, the Fashion Week’s official calendar will feature 54 shows, as opposed to the 56 of last September. Also on the programme, 96 presentations and over 30 special events, among them the gala evening for the 10th anniversary of N°21, several store openings, including one by Giorgio Armani, the inauguration of the ‘Memos’ exhibition organised by CNMI with the Poldi Pezzoli Museum, and the exhibition dedicated to Peter Lindbergh at the Armani/Silos museum.Among the week's high points are the shows by the big names of Italian fashion, from Gucci to Max Mara, Prada, Fendi, Moschino, Salvatore Ferragamo and Missoni. Not to mention Dolce & Gabbana, which will once again show off-calendar, and Boss, the main line by German label Hugo Boss, which is showing in Milan since last season.

Italian luxury sportswear label Moncler is making its come-back to the Women's Fashion Week. Not with a catwalk show, but with the third edition of the Moncler Genius project, with a special installation which is set to be unveiled on Wednesday 19. Philipp Plein will instead show on the evening of Saturday 22 with a music performance, and Ports 1961 will show on Sunday February 23.
 
Two emerging Italian talents will be added to the list of new names. The first is Gilberto Calzolari, winner of the Green Carpet Fashion Awards 2018, who will show on Wednesday 19.

The other new Italian label is Vìen, whose show is scheduled on Sunday 23. The label was founded in 2017 by Puglia-born Vincenzo Palazzo, a music lover and event organiser before he launched into fashion, and is characterised by a blend of street culture and couture style. Vìen isn’t exactly a rookie, since it first showed in Milan in June 2018, as part of the menswear calendar.
 
These new names will compensate for the seven that have dropped out of the official calendar this season, starting from Blumarine, whose parent company Blufin was bought last November by the boss of Liu Jo, Marco Marchi, via his Eccellenze Italiane holding company. British label Peter Pilotto and Antwerp-based Chinese designer Shuting Qiu have also left the Milan Fashion Week. Another Chinese designer, Angel Chen, had to drop out because he wasn't able to complete his collection in time, due to delivery problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Also not showing this season are Aigner, Tiziano Guardini, winner of the Green Carpet Fashion Awards in 2017, and Italian-Haitian designer Stella Jean, who decided to present her new collection via an awareness-raising campaign against racial discrimination.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2020","The Raj and a little rock and roll met at the latest show by Riccardo Tisci for the house of Burberry, with a skilful and sophisticated collection full to the brim with highly wearable clothes.In easily the best staging in London Fashion Week, Tisci built a mammoth 100-yard-long mirrored catwalk set underneath the giant glass ceiling of the Olympia exhibition space. At its center, high above the audience of 1,000, the Labèque sisters performed on two Steinways facing each other across the runway.
 
Tisci opened the action by concentrating on Burberry’s central DNA, the trench coat, in multiple variations. White canvas frayed just so, finished with faux fur arms, cut as a super heroine duster, trimmed with sturdy padded leather, or cut with semi-sheer silk lower halves.In a co-ed show Tisci also worked the classic plaid, with beige bowling alley jerkins, plaid duffle coats, or madras plaid shirts for guys. Ricardo even dreamed up an eye-boggling triple-plaid shirt cut into three vertical panels, each with its own neckline. Though the stand-out tartan moment was a fabulous three-piece suit on uber model Joan Smalls, cut with leggings, micro gilet and hacking jacket.
 
“India, where I spent some wonderful times, and Bethnal Green where I lived when I was a student in London,” said Tisci of his inspiration, after being embraced by Cate Blanchett and Naomi Campbell.
 
“You’re a genius!” cooed Blanchett, the Oscar winner dressed in an all-black cape coat from Tisci’s debut season.
 
It was Tisci’s Indian moment, seen in coats, suits and dresses finished with organza trim, side shards and attachments or golden collars, and above all in great combinations of madras checks – used in shirts, picnic frocks, bra tops, skirts and in cocktail dresses held together with gold chains.
 
Throughout, the sister pianists drove the drama with pounding music, playing selections from Phunkjump & Camille Jones, or Butch. The Italian designer even segued into the ultimate British sport – rugby – with a five-a-side of bright striped tops, and sent out some powerful all-black combinations for night. Before a great finale, which climaxed with a silver sequined modish maharani.
 
All told, perhaps, so far in his tenure Tisci has not quite hit the heights of creativity he achieved in his previous job at Givenchy. However, this was a catwalk crammed full of enticing fashion, sure to keep business ticking over nicely at Britain’s one real mega luxury brand.  Make no mistake about that, Tisci is finding his groove at Burberry.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2020","The British Fashion Council, MTV, Iceberg and River Island are calling on fashion design students to come up with catwalk and commercial pieces inspired by music, fashion and sustainability.The ‘Music Meets Fashion’ competition will be open to fashion students from the BFC Colleges Council network in the UK and select international design universities from the US, Mexico and Australia.

A panel of judges will select five finalists to present their MTV-inspired runway pieces at London Fashion Week Men’s in June 2020. All finalists will be awarded £1,000 from MTV to cover the cost of the samples. The ultimate winner will receive a one-year college scholarship from MTV, invaluable work experience at Milan Fashion Week in September with Iceberg and the opportunity to have their line sold later this year with River Island. 

Representatives from the BFC, MTV, River Island and Iceberg will choose the competition winner.

Caroline Rush from the British Fashion Council said the competition is “an invaluable chance for fashion students to think carefully of how their future brands will impact the planet and to put sustainability at the heart of their designs”. 

Iceberg creative director James Long added: “MTV has been a huge player in popular culture since I can remember with strong visual impact, fashion and music being a major part of my creative process… British Fashion Council has been an incredible support throughout my career and it’s an honour to work with them and to have been asked to be both a judge and mentor.”

"Feb 17, 2020","All about volumes at JW Anderson, whose hyper dimensioned collection made for an inspirational moment in London on Monday.Anderson telegraphed his idea with his invitation to his show in Yeoman House. Which featured a black photocopy of a massive spherical shaggy dress. Primitive screen printing – where the image becomes an architectural silhouette, just an outline even.
 
Like most of this collection, with its humungous shapes; 24-inch collars; curvaceous shoulders and exaggerated flares. Many dresses with shoulders finished with shards of antique celluloid that looked like ice, or even plastic seaweed. Which was faintly weird, but rather wonderful.“Making an entrance. Playing with textures and volumes. Blowing up and reducing. Nouveau chic somehow, like that moment in the 20s when everything resurged and rebounded,” explained Anderson, who took his bow in a very-worn brown hoodie and faded light blue jeans.
 
The 20s seen notably in a remarkable pink and turquoise knit dress with subtle puff shoulders. Throughout, Anderson played with odd modular shapes, creating these large structures thanks to circular knitting. Other dramatic looks included shawl-collared tuxedos and, most startlingly, a pair of sack dresses that looked like bashed-in fantasy beer cans; a sort of JW Anderson composite Special Brew. 
 
“There was a time when I was obsessed by the Guinness ads, with horses running. Not to be clichéd and Irish. But I liked the typography of Guinness – gold, and black with a touch of silver. And I like the result of crushing a can by standing on it. So those big massive coats felt slightly like the early 90s people shooting in Donegal. That sort of moment, that revealed itself when we were making the collection,” he laughed.
 
Next stop on the hyper-active Anderson agenda, the Moncler launch in 48 hours in Milan, when the Ulsterman joins the Moncler Genius project.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2020","Tommy Hilfiger staged the biggest show in London on Sunday night, taking over two giant holding tanks inside Tate Modern, the former power station that is the most visited modern art museum in Britain. 
This was to present Hilfiger’s latest See Now Buy Now show – and his fourth with Lewis Hamilton – named TommyXLewis, and indeed most of the collection featured their combined gothic script L and H logo.
 
Tommy has previously teamed up with the likes of Gigi Hadid and Zendaya in a string creative collaborations, all of them to date highly successful. All told nearly 10 collections, of which the two best were Zendaya’s Blaxploitation ideas, presented in Apollo Theater in Harlem, and Hamilton’s show with Hilfiger in Shanghai.However, before these collections all came across as kicky revamps of the diverse Hilfiger iconography, which ranges from elegiac preps and hipster homeboys to New England rockers and downtown WASPs.
 
On Sunday evening in London, however, Hamilton seemed to take over – at least in the first half of the show – and the result felt more like a pastiche than a fashion position.
 
The biggest problem was that this show reduced the argument to day-glow versions of athleisure. Precisely at a moment when that tide is waning faster than a galloping horse at Mont Saint-Michel.
 
Nor did a change in stylists help, not even shifting to Katie Grand – an enormous talent, whose works for Miuccia Prada, among others, and her own magazine Love, rank her as one of the half-dozen best in her profession. But what quite frankly was the point of a quintet of veteran models – Naomi Campbell, who opened the show in a yellow yachting splash top and pants, followed by the likes of Yasmin Le Bon, Jodie Kidd and Erin O’Connor – and then dressing them in clothes designed for their nieces? Bulky lemon nylon jumpsuits, oversized denim jackets and nuclear plant outfits. Oversized T-shirts are not ideal 40-something gear.By the way, one had to love the giant Stars and Stripes parkas, great chalk-stripe Hamptons homeboy shorts and shrunken A-line cricket blazers. Plus, the casting was inclusive and pretty excellent, including uber catwalkers Winnie Harlow and Halima Aden, and Lottie Moss, and starring rock royalty such as Lucas Jagger, James Turlington, Ella Richards, Sonny Ashcroft, Pixie Geldof and Georgia May Jagger.
 
Though the best moment went to Jasmine Sanders, the German-American model raised in South Carolina. Expect to read more about her. Moreover, the wide variety of physical size and silhouette was a powerful clarion call for inclusivity.
 
All told, another show and collection sure to drive business, though not one to burnish the remarkable legend of Tommy Hilfiger, a small-town boy from upstate New York, poised – if trends continue – to become the biggest American designer brand worldwide later this decade.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 17, 2020","Extinction Rebellion activists on Saturday blocked traffic outside London Fashion Week to protest against the fashion industry's ""exploitation"" of the environment.

Dozens of demonstrators blocked the road near the main building hosting catwalk shows, which began on Friday and continue until Tuesday.""We started by blocking the road, four people were wearing barbed wire dresses and attached themselves to the ground,"" XR spokeswoman Sara Arnold, 33, told AFP.

""The system is based on obsolescence, exploitation and overproduction. This affects the planet, the people, the animals. It needs systemic change.""It is not the first time ""XR"" activists have targeted fashion week, having covered themselves in fake blood and tied themselves to the entrance at last September's event.

The movement sent a letter on Monday to the industry lobby group British Fashion Council asking them to cancel London's fashion week in September.

Conscious of the accusations, the industry is this week showcasing its efforts in an exhibition dedicated to ""positive fashion"".

Many designers concerned about the impact of fashion on the environment are choosing to use renewable or recycled materials and support local craftsmanship.

But environmental activists believe this is not enough and that urgent action is needed.

The protest took place on the second day of Fashion Week, which saw the first London show of Petar Petrov, who presented his women's autumn/winter 2020/21 collection.

The designer, whose brand has just celebrated its tenth anniversary, unveiled the elegant and sober collection in the surroundings of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) listed headquarters located near Regent's Park.

The collection was marked by extra long flared sleeves and wide trouser suits held in place by thin belts.

Versatility was key, with coats worn as dresses and scarf necks and draped jackets that can be tied in different ways.

""I grew up without elegance, I grew up in a socialistic town and everyone had the same,"" said the designer, who grew up in Bulgaria and the Ukraine with his tailor mother.

He inherited her love of fabrics, a legacy that has become central to the company's ethos.

Other shows on Saturday include Britain's Molly Goddard, known for her voluminous and colourful tulle dresses, and Richard Quinn, who was honoured two years ago by the queen with the ""Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design"".Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Feb 16, 2020","A touch of rebellion at Victoria Beckham on Sunday morning, and the collection was all the better for it, suggesting that the designer, and her house, are on the path to a healthy future.Outside, Whitehall was being battered by Storm Dennis; inside all was calm and swish and sophisticated. Nonetheless, given recent losses, everyone on Beckham’s front row was openly speculating about the future of her business. But judging from the quality of this collection, her fashion house has a very rosy one.
 
This was the first show from the brand to feature a new beauty serum, part of the make-up line Beckham is producing herself, and the result was the most fresh-faced looking cast we have seen on any Victoria Beckham catwalk. There may well be gold in Posh’s Power Serum.Her opening looks were all in black – perfectly executed little black dresses and slip dresses dissected with woven metal belts, followed by a couple of excellent spy coats and trench coats, made with voluminous super heroine silhouettes. Plus, her mannish doubled-breasted herringbone coats, stylish culottes and plaid combinations all had authority. The show climaxed with a pair of beautiful silk slip dresses in a broken animal print.
 
The show was staged inside the Banqueting House, opposite Downing Street, the last remnants of the Palace of Whitehall, the residence of the British monarchs from 1530 to 1698. Here the cast marched underneath Rubens’ beautiful frescos of the Apotheosis of King James I.
 
“Being here under Rubens was inspirational, even if I am a minimalist. I don’t like anything over designed. It’s about finding ways to elevate and refine each season, but with a little rebellion this time. Did you hear the music?” smiled Beckham referring to a curse word in one song.
 
All told, a polished performance by this designer, who clearly is increasingly in charge of her atelier. It’s true that the brand did suffer a £10 million loss in 2017, though the new managers installed by NEO Investment Partners substantially whittled that down in the following two years. Moreover, Victoria launched her own beauty collection online in September and the first results have been excellent.According to CEO Ralph Toledano, the business went positive in the last quarter of 2019. By starting her own beauty collection, rather than opting for a license deal with a makeup behemoth, Beckham will need substantial capital investment. However, informed observers expect the Spice Gal to be running a profitable company very soon. So we can bin the bankruptcy notices, especially after today’s show.
 
“We just launched our new Power Serum with Augustinus Bader. So it was about looking after these girls, and nourishing their skin. We gave them all facials beforehand. I wanted a natural, healthy, youthful glow. And this show was celebrating that, with a little bit of our new Smoky Eye Brick,” concluded Victoria.

"Feb 15, 2020","Molly Goddard staged the first major show of London Fashion Week on Saturday afternoon, and her muse was an indulgent choice – her dad. 
Her spark of inspiration for Fall 2020 was a photo of herself with her father taken in 1992, which she discovered in a book of street photography published by Japanese street style magazine Fruits.
 
Her combinations for her dresses were unlikely, but not ungainly – expansive, ruffled chiffon frocks worn with Fair Isle sweaters and anchored by brothel creepers.""Friends of my parents were always throwing together old T-shirts with coats they found in their grandparents’ closets. I suppose I did too,"" laughed Goddard in the backstage of Central Hall in Westminster, across the square from the British parliament.
 
""I only found the image the other day. It reminded of how much fun it was growing up and going to Portobello Market with all the vintage clothes. I used to want to dress up just to go to Portobello, as everyone looked so interesting there,"" added Goddard.
 
The show was staged as a banquet, with French provincial wine and sliced-up baguettes on white table clothes. With about a dozen guests per table, it almost felt like 40 versions of the Last Supper.
 
Every fashionista of note in the UK showed up for Goddard, who has carved out a huge following with her exaggerated shapes and funky tulle frocks. Godard loves ruffles so much, her handbags are made of them.
 
Molly can slide into the absurd with her over-the-top shapes, but her images have a tender beauty that makes her a special designer. This season she added crocheted flowers to vamp up the mood, yet kept the atmosphere daffy, with huge ribbons and bows sewn onto beanies. She also sent out more of her signature dark taffeta schoolgirl dresses.
 Plus, she showed several men’s looks, playing with similar materials to those used in the women’s clothes – windowpane check, ruffles and beanies with bows.
 
""My boyfriend always complains that I never make men’s clothes, so I did,"" giggled the Central Saint Martins MA graduate, who in barely a half-decade has made her show a must-see in London.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 14, 2020","The house of Hermès unveiled its latest annual theme, which for 2020 is Innovation in the Making, with a multi-layered series of events spread across Manhattan on Thursday. This being Hermes, they included a morning symposium on an island in New York Bay with a series of proper brains and, in the evening, a mesmerizingly poetic display - a live film performance of special effects inside the latest, future super-boutique of Hermès, the equestrian brand par excellence, on Madison Avenue.The day began with a school bus ride down the East River and a windy ferry crossing to Governor’s Island, where the house’s artistic director Pierre-Alexis Dumas and art apparatchik Lili Chopra conducted a series of debates and lectures. From a philosophical discourse by France’s most-read living philosopher François Jullien; a lecture on space travel by a real astronaut; a learned lesson on paleoanthropology; a dance performance by Okwui Okpokwasili; and an interview with former Apple design master Jony Ive.
 
Landing on the island to be greeted by a local brass band playing before a sign that read, Welcome to Hermès University. Inside the exhibition space, the morning’s participants’ names were written on chalk on a series of blackboards.“Hello, I’m the Dean of Creative Studies, and you are the class of 2020,” joked Pierre-Alexis in his opening remarks, as 150 guests sat on small metal high school desks. He promised the morning would go from the origin of man to the ends of the universe. It did. Beginning with hunter gatherers who rode the first horses and already knew one of Hermès mottos: ""If you fall off the horse you get right back on again.”
 
Astronaut Dr. Peggy Whitson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, explained that space travel was all about looking at things from different angles, as she showed some remarkable photos of earth from the Space Station. And a series of images of her team in outer space mending a gigantic solar panel which had ripped, basically sewing it back together with steel ropes.
 
“Growing up on a farm, my dad used to always say that you could fix pretty much anything with a pair of pliers and a roll of Number 9 wire, which is pretty much what we did!” she smiled.A key element in innovation for Hermès is of course craftsmanship, and the meeting of a pair of dexterous hands with a fertile imagination.  
 
Looking way back in history, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, showed the development of the hand, and the gradual articulation of the thumb with images of ancient remains. Before explaining that about 100,000 years ago humans began to make symbolic images. Starting with the discovery in the Blombos cave in South Africa of the earliest art – geometric patterns on rock art, dating from 77,000 years ago and passing through pre-historic paintings in Paleolithic art of horses. The house of Hermès was founded in 1837 by Thierry Hermès, as a harness workshop for horses in central Paris.
 
The morning ended with Ives and Dumas recalling their collaboration with the first Apple Watch, a debut partnership for the firm with a luxury brand. Made with the famed double-tour Barenia leather strap, which immediately ran into a glitch, explained Ive. Apple engineers had complained that the double strap meant the watch could not touch the wrist, preventing it from measuring the pulse – a key element in the design. Whereupon, a lady craftsman in the Hermès Paris workshop added, on her on initiative, some thin interior padding which meant the strap sat ever so slightly to one side, allowing the pulse to be taken. 
 
“Objects shape us, just as we shape objects,” concluded Dumas, before hosting a great lunch, cooked by Daniela Soto-Innes, the award-winning Mexican chef. Innovation was the leitmotif of this meal – from duck carnitas to crab and corn ceviche to sea buckthorn aguachile. Lucullan Latin fusion cooking.
 
That evening, Dumas also hosted a fête inside the new four-story site of the brand’s future flagship, in a red-brick Federal style building. Located on the south-west corner of Madison and 63rd street, it was previously The Bank of New York.
 
The highlight was an astonishing display by a team of a dozen skilled film artisans of a life action special effects movie. Using a dozen tiny sets on wheels, they projected a surrealist short film on the screen, a trip that included visits to the snowy Rockies; the elegiac South West; dreamlike Poppy fields; storm cast moors and Upper East Side apartments, all through which pirouetted several pairs of hands. The skill of the artisan ever present.

"Feb 14, 2020","Luxury label Alexander McQueen has unveiled a new system that redirects surplus fabrics from the Kering-controlled business for students at fashion colleges in the UK to use in their work.Donated fabrics are a major materials source for students and donations from a label known for its luxe fabrics and unique prints should be very much in demand.

“The ethos at Alexander McQueen means that everything we use in researching and designing collections has always been archived and stored,” the label’s creative chief Sarah Burton said. “We’ve never thrown anything away.” The fabrics stored as a result of this approach include materials from both the women’s and men’s collections going back 10 years.

It’s a “practical extension of the education programme” introduced by Burton, the company said.

A spokesperson added that the “donations build on the inter-relationships between Alexander McQueen teams, fashion colleges and students, which have developed since Sarah Burton opened a space for installations, talks, illustration and study workshops at the Alexander McQueen store at 27 Bond Street in January 2019”.

And Burton explained that setting up that space “inspired all of us, and reminded me of being a student, and how tough it is when you can’t afford to buy fabric for your final collection. I was so lucky because when I first worked at McQueen, Lee helped me source fabrics for my final collection.

Scheduled to run February through April 2023, the “Fresh, Fly, and Fabulous: Fifty Years of Hip Hop Style” exhibition will track the history of hip hop fashion from its roots right up to the present day, following its journey “from the hood to the runway,” while also examining its impact on wider culture.
 
The exhibition will be co-curated by Elena Romero, assistant professor of advertising and marketing communications at FIT, and the museum’s assistant curator of costume Elizabeth Way. The duo will be supported by an advisory committee composed of experts in fashion, music, journalism, academia, and education.“For 50 years, hip hop has made its mark on U.S. culture and the world,” commented Romero, who is also the author of Free Stylin': How Hip Hop Changed the Fashion Industry. “It is the perfect time to exhibit, examine, and celebrate the contributions of our youth and people of color who ignited a multibillion-dollar industry, once considered a passing fad.”
 
The Museum at FIT’s Hip Hop Style Archive was established last year as part of the preparations for the exhibition but is also part of the museum’s permanent holdings.
 
The constantly growing collection is currently made up predominantly of men’s and women’s apparel, footwear and accessories. Pieces include creations by designers ranging from Dapper Dan to Chanel, via American sportswear and luxury designers and European luxury brands.
 
An especially important aspect of the archive is its collection of pieces by the designers of color – particularly African American and Latinx designers – who helped establish hip hop as a global trend.
 
Those interested in donating to the Hip Hop Style Archive can submit their details via an online form on the FIT website.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 13, 2020","Pantone has released a new colour forecast for AW20/21 linked to the opening of London Fashion Week and the colour specialist is predicting “creatively conscious"" tones that are all about an “optimistic sense of purpose”.The Pantone Color Institute’s colour experts said the shades “reflect our desire for a substantial palette of meaningful colour. Colours expressive of a classic British sensibility that offer longevity, durability and can endure. At the same time, colours that exhibit uplift, convey an optimistic sense of fun and purpose and whose intrinsic versatility encourages creativity and instills confidence”.

In practice that means a “robust palette” of 10 colours including 17-1562 Mandarin Red, a “dynamic, amplified and provocative orange-infused red tone”, and 19-1662 Samba, a “voluptuous sultry red [that] introduces an upbeat energy”. Also powerful is 17-1349 Exuberance, “a good natured and expansive orange shade [that] conveys a message of spontaneity and happiness”.Along with 19-1540 Burnt Henna, a robust red but with a more “sophisticated earthiness”, it suggests a strong season for reds of all kinds and one in which brands’ (and consumers’) tastes continue to run to powerful colour stories. But among the reds, and the rest of the shades in the palette, there's a new warmth in the tones and it’s interesting that there’s a distinct absence of the power brights.

There are blues too, including the virtually neutral 19-4024 Dress Blues, plus 19-4057 True Blue and 18-4051 Strong Blue, the latter’s red undertone “injecting vibrancy into this confident shade” and seeing blue move out from the classics category into more fashion-focused palettes.And greens continue to take their place in the sun with 19-0622 Military Olive, 14-0647 Celery (“a vital yellow green that reflects the natural freshness of nature”) and 18-5338 Ultramarine Green (a deep cooling blue-green) all highlighting the versatility of the green story overall.

It’s all anchored by softer neutrals such as the rustic and rugged tan of 17-1225 Tawny Birch, the rawness of off-white 11-0605 Jet Stream, the rich camel of 14-1122 Sheepskin, and that must-have of all current palettes, a grey. This time it's 16-3916 Sleet.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 13, 2020","After the postponement of Chinese shows and fashion weeks, due to the coronavirus outbreak, China's designers are the latest to forfeit. A number of designers, who are mostly based in Europe and featured on the London and Paris calendars, won’t be able to present their collections at the upcoming fashion weeks.
 For the upcoming fashion week in Milan taking place between February 18 and 24, three Chinese brands have announced that they were unable to complete their collections in time, due to delays in shipments that were caused by the country’s current coronavirus epidemic.

In Paris, several labels have had to drop out of the runway and presentation calendar, including Masha Ma, Shiatzy Chen, Uma Wang, Jarel Zhan, Calvin Luo and Maison Mai. “They are not in a position where they could present their collections at the next Paris Fashion Week,” indicated the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, who will “make its entire communication network available to them during this period, in order to share the work that they so dearly wanted to present, both in France and abroad.”In light of this cancelation, Shiatzy Chen’s CEO Harry Wang commented, in a release: “We believe that this is the most appropriate course of action, after much reflection on the subject.""

The Italian fashion's governing body, Camera della Moda, wanted to show its solidarity with China. Its ""China we are with you"" campaign will launch on Tuesday, February 18, devoting an event to the country on Milan’s opening night.

Throughout the week, it will also broadcast multiple video exchanges between the two countries, providing the Chinese industry professionals who stayed at home with the possibility of seeing certain runway shows live.

For this campaign, eight emerging brands have been selected to present their work at the Fashion Hub Market, a space dedicated to young designers. They include Xun Ruo, Leaf Xia, Han Wen, Pinhui Zhao, Emma Sweet, Zijue, Dot Minute and Shengyi Liu, who have been selected by Chic, the Chinese retail giant using its Chinese-Italian platform Fashion Town. Han Wen, based in New York, will even present a runway show.

It will also be possible to see a few Chinese labels in Paris. Notably the label Dawei created by Dawei Sun, who attended both the Beaux-Arts and the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. Sun is based in both Beijing and Paris, and has shown on the French runway since last year.“The studio is based in Beijing and resumed work on Monday. They are currently advancing on the fall-winter 2020/21 collection, which will be revealed on February 25, in Paris. We’ve had to change our work schedule a bit and have also revisited our initial plan for the collection. But there have been no major changes,” Dawei commented.

“Beijing is much further north than Wuhan or Shanghai. That’s why we haven’t felt the impact of the epidemic as much. Production will be affected of course, since factories have only been reopened with a reduced staff,” Dawei concluded. The brand By Fang has also confirmed that it would be presenting its collection with a showroom.

But beyond Chinese designers, fashion representatives from China will also turn up in significantly lower numbers. “Two Chinese exhibitors and one from Hong Kong will show at Tranoi,” said Boris Provost, the head of the Parisian salon taking place from February 28 and March 2.

“They’ll be present because they aren’t concerned. However, we already know that we will have fewer Chinese visitors. We have around 200 Chinese buyers, of which some haven’t returned home since the January shows. Others will simply not be able to come and large accounts will need to send reduced teams,” continued Provost.

Kering, whose brands include Gucci, Balenciaga, and Saint Laurent, will be seen on the Milan and Paris runways. The group is, however, expecting a 30-40% drop in attendance. Visitors coming from Asia will probably not be able to attend the shows due to the implementation of pandemic-related travel bans.

The expected drop in attendance will be of even greater strategic importance, considering that the Chinese are the leading luxury consumers in the world. To make up for this absence, the sector is putting together digital solutions as a fallback, so that they can still present their collections to Asian players and partners.

"Feb 13, 2020","We know everyone has been bellyaching about it being a lightweight season in New York bereft of so many heavy hitter designers. But if you take the time to actually study what was on the runway it turns out there were a lot of great clothes on display in Manhattan.
 Moreover, if the fashion in New York this season tell us anything it’s to expect a somber and serious mood this winter. A grave atmosphere heightened by the almost complete absence of anyone from China at any event in New York. Just in terms of attendance at shows it suddenly felt like the clock had been turned back 15 years.
 
That said, expect the autumn to be enlivened by an array of soft and sensual clothes made with sustainability in mind. In uncertain times, from Coronavirus to conniptions in Washington, designers concentrated on doing what they do best, respecting their DNA. Around town, Proenza Schouler went for a stricter silhouette mixed with nonchalant draping – half the jackets and dresses slipped off one shoulder - and the result was the most important show in America. 
 
Other brands respecting their territory included the two purveyors of patrician polish – Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera, who both witnessed classy performances from the successors to the founders – the Monse duo Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, and Wes Gordon respectively.
 
At Monse, one also had to admire the Vivienne Westwood revival, albeit with a major deconstructed twist. A photo of Westwood was even on their mood-board backstage; while out at the Oscars, Westwood had a stellar red carpet moment – dressing Kate Hudson, Natalie Dormer and Winnie Harlow.The opening weekend was, of course, dominated by events elsewhere – specifically Los Angeles. The Academy Awards falling on the same weekend as the NYC runway season, as it does two out of seven years, meant that Manhattan was largely bereft of proper grade movie stars. Plus, Tom Ford, the chairman of the CFDA, which organizes the NYC season, skipped out of Manhattan to show in LA. As did Julie de Libran, the former Sonia Rykiel designer who now has her own Indie label. She seemed to grab a lot more column inches and social media attention with her Matchesfashion collaboration in Hancock Park than many shows back on the East Coast.
 
The NYC season did throw up some bold new talents. Most notably LaQuan Smith, whose hybrid rockin’ hip hop glitz made for a great show in Spring Studios. Whether anthracite puffer jackets cut like super heroine armor or matelassé shiny black princess coats, worthy of an intergalactic warrior woman.
 
Few brands were truer to themselves than Zimmermann, who went for optimistic fashion, layering bright colors and their signature lettering and playful prints. Their blend of velvet trim; hand sequined organza; crystal buttons and pastel resin eye frames and charm bracelets made this the happiest show in town. Zimmermann is now the most happening foreign brand in America, with a thriving boutique on Madison, located almost catty corner to that thoroughfare’s most famous shopping destination, the Rhinelander mansion of Ralph Lauren. Ralph didn’t even stage a presentation, never mind a show.
 
The next corner up Madison seemed to capture the moment. The newspaper vending machine sold not the New York Times, but instead the China Daily. Its latest issue carrying the most improbable of headlines. It read: “Fewer new infections seen; more cured.”
 
A reminder surely of the danger of not telling your citizens or society the real truth; of not levelling with people. Unlike this NYC season, where designers gave an honest account of who they exactly were.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 13, 2020","Brace yourself for the first post-Brexit season in London, which will dominate the coming long weekend. It has finally happened, and nobody in the UK or throughout European fashion seems terribly happy about that. 
Few industries are as global as fashion, especially when one considers how many of the clothes seen in London shows are actually manufactured in continental Europe. And how many non-British designers chose to show in London. A scan of the British Fashion Council’s official show schedule indicates that the majority of creators were not born in the British Isles.
 
The five-day season opens Friday, February 14, and climaxes on Tuesday evening with the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design. The Queen attended the opening award – given to Richard Quinn in 2018 – and a senior member of the Royal Family will do the honors this month.Caroline Rush, the Chief Executive of the British Fashion Council, confirmed that Alighieri’s Rosh Mahtani would be honored with the award this year, adding, “Mahtani is an inspiration for many young British designers and we look forward to presenting her with this prestigious award.”
 
Though the biggest gala show in London will welcome back an old friend Tommy Hilfiger, who will unveil his fourth TommyxLewis collection in collaboration with the British Formula One multiple world champion.
 
Another new arrival is Austrian innovator Petar Petrov, who has moved his show from Paris to London, while France’s MM6, the diffusion collection by Maison Margiela, will also be presenting again.

As for the NEWGEN designers, Rush commented: “These young designers are known for their creativity, strong design aesthetic and point of difference and include Alighieri, Halpern, Isosceles, Matty Bovan, Richard Malone, Richard Quinn and NewGen One To Watch; Eftychia.”
 
Plus, the city will also be featuring its heavy hitter houses – starting with UK luxury’s one truly global behemoth, Burberry. Along with its younger and often avant-garde stars – JW Anderson, Erdem, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, Simone Rocha and Victoria Beckham.
 The BFC has also introduced an experimental zone named Discovery LAB, which will feature music, workshops and the projection of Yohji Yamamoto 1983 – 2016. There will be a new Model Zone, a relaxing space where models can eat, drink and relax. To help guarantee their privacy and safety, the BFC has deliberately kept that location secret.
 
With some 60 shows, the choice remains rich in London, thanks to designer houses of the caliber of Amanda Wakeley, Chalayan, Fashion East, Huishan Zhang, Margaret Howell, Mark Fast, Marques'Almeida,Richard Quinn, Roland Mouret and BFC Fashion Trust Recipient Molly Goddard.

Rush also welcomed back the Positive Fashion Exhibition, a ""curated space with 39 brands showcasing a presentation, campaign or interactive storytelling experience that answers to one or more of the three pillars of Positive Fashion: Environment, People, Craftsmanship & Community.”
 
According to the BFC, the whole season is “set to unite London with 78 brands, 103 stores and 346 events taking place across five days in partnership with key retailers, cultural institutions and businesses, aimed at opening London Fashion Week to new audiences and communities.”
 
In a word, a rich selection of quirky, cool and commercial. And despite alarm bells in Brussels about the tougher negotiating position of the new government under Boris Johnson, Downing Street is still very much open for fashion.
 
Maintaining a tradition under both Conservative and Labour governments, there will be a reception at Number 10 for senior fashion leaders. Not exactly a no-deal stance, fortunately.

"Feb 12, 2020","The upcoming fashion weeks will witness a project that combines both creativity and eco-responsibility. FashionNetwork.com  got a preview of the collection, signed by five young international talents for the Italian label Cashmere Flakes. The work of Dawei, Victoria/Tomas, Savoar Fer, Marco Rambaldi and Cinoh will be unveiled in a few days on the Milan, Paris and Tokyo runways. The result is an ethical collection, punctuated by easy yet high-end products.The collection will consist of five capsules, with five to fifteen pieces each, expressing the creative spirits of these five international creators. It features everything from contemporary fun-shaped nylon down jackets to extraordinary cashmere coats, knit pieces, an unusual après-ski jumpsuit along with fashionable padded nylon or cashmere skirts and jackets.

The project will be presented as part of the Impact section at the Première Classe show in Paris, taking place between February 28 and March 2. The label’s showroom, located at 9 Place des Vosges in Paris' 4th arrondissement, will also show the collection until March 6.  It combines all the elements for a great story: a historic house, a couple of committed entrepreneurs, a positive impact on the planet, and especially the nomadic Mongolian shepherds and the luxurious and innovative product that results.  Everything began a few years ago when Francesco Saldarini, the head of the family-run business -- founded in Como in 1882 with his wife Laurence Vanderhaegen -- decided to find an alternative to goose and synthetic feather jackets.

Initially a silk thread and fabric producer, Saldarini transitioned into an accessories brand over the last couple of decades, with scarves and eventually clothing. In the last four years, the company has been committed to a sustainable approach, with the launch of Cashmere Flakes. The new clothing brand was named after its manufacturing process, using “flakes” of cashmere from Mongolia to create its apparel.
 In 2016, Cashmere Flakes filed a patent for the stuffing process of their down jackets, made from the certified cashmere “flakes” from hircus goats in Mongolia. Trimming the goats with a comb, the hair is collected by hand. In other words, the lost hairs still hanging on their coats after the spring shedding are recovered. This is done by some 83,000 nomadic families, united under the Mongolian shepherds’ cooperative national union.

The harvest is then sent to Italy, where it is treated and worked on according to a process perfected by Saldarini, resulting in the cashmere flakes that are used to stuff the jackets. The fiber is also used to create luxurious knitwear and the fabric for jackets, pants, dressed and notably coats.

“It’s a sustainable approach since cashmere is natural and we avoid overproduction by following the animal’s natural rhythm of life. The process protects the goats while simultaneously supporting the local socio-economic fabric of the nomads. We have reached an agreement with the government and the shepherds’ union, guaranteeing them a reasonable purchase price, without passing through Chinese intermediaries,” Saldarini explained.“The consortium was in fact developed through a Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation project, which set a code of conduct for sustainable livestock farming that sources from Mongolian pastures in a balanced and respectful way, allowing the environment to renew itself. As a result, a virtuous circle was created,” he continued.

After the launch of Cashmere Flakes in 2017, the entrepreneur was immediately contacted by other major players in the luxury industry, resulting in a partnership with Giorgio Armani for its production of stuffed jackets. The brand has simultaneously developed its own collection, calling on several young designers. 

In February 2019, the first two capsules by the Japanese brand Ujoh from Mitsuru Nishizaki and the young designer Marco Rambaldi were presented. Next winter, the collection will expand thanks to the expertise of PLC Consulting’s Patricia Lerat, the talented luxury and footwear consultant.

Dawei, Victoria/Tomas and Savoar Fer, the three designers alongside the Italian entrepreneur, will be accompanied by Cinoh, the Japanese label succeeding Ujoh. The label’s designer Takayuki Chino won the Tokyo Fashion Award in 2019.“We will be launching Cashmere Flakes’s e-commerce in June. For the moment, the line is only sold through a very limited selection of top-notch multi-brands. We hope to only have one partner in each big city,” explained Saldarini, whose clients include 10 Corso Como in Milan and the online site LuisaViaRoma, via LVR Sustainable.

As of now, the company only has two single-brand stores – in Cortina and Serravalle – and is focusing on a new project. In 2019, it made 4.8 million euros.

"Feb 12, 2020","Italian fashion house Ermanno Scervino has chosen the French Riviera, more precisely the principality of Monaco, as the venue for its 2021 cruise Show, reports Women's Wear Daily. The show will be held on May 14, 2020.Scheduling for the cruise show season now looks to be (almost) as dense as it has been for recent Fashion Weeks, with shows planned at locations all over the world. Ermanno Scervino, which this year is the guest of honor at the Monte-Carlo Fashion Week from May 14-18, will present its event in Monaco. The show will take place on May 14 at the Monte-Carlo Sporting.

"Feb 12, 2020","The reigning king of American sportswear, Michael Kors, was in ebullient form this season, presenting a powerful collection just off Wall street, on a crisp Wednesday morning, the final day of the New York season.Staged inside the former New York Stock Exchange, an apt setting for Kors, a member of that most rarefied of clubs – the billionaire fashion designer. You can practically count them all on one hand, and with the exception of Giorgio Armani, they are all essentially American.
 
But Kors was in no mood to splurge on excess this season, instead he concentrated on comfort, and cozy glamour in one of his strongest statements in several seasons.Almost every model was enveloped in cashgora cape coats, oversized Aran sweater dresses, cashmere ponchos, gun-check coatdresses or black Tattersall double-face wool Melton clutch jackets. Everything was cut forgivingly, flared and with extended Jesuitical trumpet sleeves. Wholesome certainly, but snazzy too – especially the plongé fringed skirts, fabulous gun-metal sequined pleated dresses, and Himalayan shearling coats for romantic winter walks.  Every second gal wore flat riding boots or high, rugged wellies.
 
Plus, in a co-ed show there was even a Dixon of Dock Green moment, with one chap appearing in a wool Melton officer’s coat cape and riding pants.
 
The show was backed up by a live performance by fashion’s singer of the moment Orville Peck, who also performed at the mega Dior menswear party during Art Basel in Miami in December. Though Peck was on even greater form today in Manhattan, ending the show with a rousing version of “I Will Always Love You, just as Bella Hadid wafted by in a silken halter-neck cocktail.
 
Kors’ color palette was wholesome too – barley, ecru, olive and a hue Kors’ program notes defined as “banker black.”
 “I just think that right now everyone needs coziness and to be enveloped in security. We’d all love to leave and go to the country but we still have to look good in the city,” Kors told FashionNetwork.com, seconds after posing for photos with Blake Lively and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
 
Hence, even as he approaches his 40th anniversary next year, this fashion veteran continues to keep his fashion fresh.
 
“40 years next year! You’ve got to love it, no?” laughed the designer, as a swarm of fans engulfed him.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 12, 2020","French label Longchamp first showed in New York in September 2018 to celebrate its 70th anniversary, and has now become a NY Fashion Week regular, with the ability to rejuvenate itself season after season, without being hemmed in by its key element, leather.“Here, I feel freer than at home in Paris,” said Longchamp’s Creative Director Sophie Delafontaine after the show. “So [I take] a few more risks. [When you’re] abroad, you go farther, you explore more, and I also love the idea of showing that Longchamp is a very international label,” she added.

This season, Delafontaine gave New York a glimpse of the Parisian women of the 1970s, embodied by actresses like Catherine Deneuve and Romy Schneider. Models clad in maxi skirts - a change after last season’s uber-short silhouettes - high-heeled boots, turtleneck sweaters and puff sleeves, strutted down the catwalk under the watchful eye of top model Kendall Jenner, Longchamp’s brand ambassador.Accessories are Longchamp’s core business, and Delafontaine went for patent leather shoes, inspired by the shiny brilliance of the bodywork used by US artist John Chamberlain for his crushed-car sculptures.

Delafontaine also reinterpreted the Pliage handbag, one of Longchamp’s signature models, into several different sizes.Christopher John Rogers does sexyThe 26 year-old US designer is in full bloom. After first catching the critics’ eye in 2018, last November he won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, an annual award for emerging US designers.Past winners include Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler and, in 2018, Pyer Moss. With the $400,000 prize money, Rogers has upped his professional game, having more means to express his fashion vision. The essential traits of Rogers’s previous collections - bright colours, a penchant for volumes and a glam vibe - all featured in his latest work, this time expressed with an extra touch of sophistication and fresh consistency.

“We like to play with volume,” he told the Essence magazine's website before the show, adding “but there’s a new edginess, a trimmer line. [The Fall 2020 collection is] a bit sexier than past seasons.”Private Policy slams pharma industryThe duo of Chinese-born New York designers Haoran Li and Siying Qu, who founded Private Policy in 2015, like to use their shows as a platform to draw attention to societal issues.

This season, they chose to denounce the pharmaceutical industry’s practice of “spending more money on marketing than on research,” as Li told the AFP agency after the show. To conjure up the image of an industry that, according to the duo, “maximises profits to the detriment of patients’ health,” Private Policy featured medical gloves ubiquitously in its show.

Several models wore blouses inspired by hospital staff uniforms, while a plush teddy bear speared by three syringes featured on a sweater. At a time when many are questioning the relevance of catwalk shows, Private Policy sees them as a way of going beyond fashion in order to deliver a message: “I believe this is what interests people nowadays,” said Li, who nevertheless doesn’t expect all designers to make political statements. “I love the idea of diversity. Each one of us can be inspired by different things,” he said.

Li regretted the fact that “many” of the invited guests weren’t “able to come [to New York] because of the ban” on travel to the USA for anyone who had been in China in the last two weeks, due to the coronavirus.

"Feb 11, 2020","Fashion, at least in the hands of a designer with real vision, can have a poetic moment. And it did on Tuesday morning in Manhattan, in a refined yet racy show by Vera Wang, presented in a storied mansion on Fifth Avenue. 
The show was staged inside the James B. Duke House, one of the last extant great mansions of Millionaires’ Row, for a select band of editors and afficionados. Built for one of the founders of American Tobacco and designed in homage to an hôtel particulier in Bordeaux, the building’s blend of projecting central bay and pediment, channeled rustication and Attic balustrade, made it the ideal setting for these clothes.
 
Not that there was anything remotely classic about this Fall/Winter collection by Wang, which was about reinventing evening clothes for daytime, or even the bedroom.Most looks were semi-sheer – whether ruched camisoles, chiffon halter-neck dresses, or featherweight floral bodysuits cut as columns. Everything with side straps, train details or ruffled trim.
 
Wang added a fair dosh of tough chic to the mix, with posh S&M harnesses, dog collars and chokers finishing black corset dresses that sprouted tulle or stretch bodysuits with varsity trim. The entire cast wafted over the bitter lemon carpet installed inside the stately home, which eventually became one of the homes of legendary heiress Doris Duke, often called “the world’s richest girl.” An individual who had affairs too numerous to mention, Doris knew more about the boudoir than most. 
Backed up by a great soundtrack – an artful selection of classical violin, Anne-Sophie Mutter playing Schubert – the show made for a formidable statement of imaginative fashion.
 
“Night. Breaking down evening. Boudoir meets body,” Wang wrote in her program notes.
 
And it was a show that won prolonged applause for the designer, who took an extended tour of the mansion catwalk, Anna Wintour leading the applause.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

"Feb 11, 2020","Emilio Pucci is going to make a comeback on the Milanese catwalks after a three-year absence. Even though the Emilio Pucci show will not feature on the Milan Fashion Week's official calendar, being instead part of the presentation programme, it is clear evidence of the relaunch plans of the LVMH-owned Italian label. The show is scheduled for Thursday February 20, in a deconsecrated church. 
Last month, the Florentine luxury label announced a strategic change in its creative direction, having decided to call on external designers to reinterpret its collection archives.

The first collaboration, which will be unveiled at the forthcoming show, is with Christelle Kocher, who has taken charge of the Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection. The French designer has been showing in Paris with her label Koché since 2015, and was chosen to inaugurate Emilio Pucci's new approach.To present her first output for the legendary Italian label, Kocher has decided to stage a genuine catwalk show, rather than a presentation as was initially announced.

"Feb 11, 2020","They still make clothes for grown-ups in New York, and nowhere more so than at Oscar de la Renta, the ne plus ultra of uptown American fashion. 
Grown-up glamour, couture-worthy luxury, and several hundred light years away from Athleisure in an impressive show and collection by design duo Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, staged late Monday night inside the New York Public Library.
 
Bella Hadid opened a procession of models strolling down an 80-meter marble catwalk, in front of the audience perched on a single row of white cane chairs. Hadid in a languid cornflower blue cashmere coat, white silk blouse and flared wool pants, setting the mood of jaunty elegance.Followed by Somalian-born beauty Ugbad Abdi, in a taiga green cashmere sweater and pink wool pants finished with a ribbed leather belt, her head covered a beige silk hijab.
 
The style was classy yet with a kick – as in a diagonal wool tweed suit done with a flared mini and matching boots.

Then, just when things were getting a tad formal, Garcia and Kim changed gears – with a gorgeous ensemble of an Aran sweater embroidered with a huge floral abstract crystal brooch, all worn over a fabulously billowing faille gown with peony print. 
For evening, the pair draped and sculpted with abandon, rouching silk faille into wonderfully curvaceous concoctions. A series of looks – giant floral shapes in Yves Klein blue, kissing pink and candy red - underlining the two designers growing self confidence at the house. 
 
“A meeting of the Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice from Fantasia,” smiled Garcia, seconds after posing for photos with his partner and Hadid.
 
Once again, like many of the best shows in America, the behind-the-scenes experts were almost all French. From the rather divine naturalist pulled back hairstyles, courtesy of legendary hair stylist Odile Gilbert, to the saucy rouge from makeup master Tom Pecheux , adding just the right touch of devil may care.
 
From the bold lighting of producer Thierry Dreyfus to the DJ Sebastien Perrin, who played a mash-up of dance funk like Let Me Go from Sault to, bien sur, the famed Sorcerer’s Apprentice theme, where Mickey Mouse gets into all sorts of bother.
 
“And that was not American music! Don’t forget it was by a French composer, Paul Dukas back in 1897,” insisted Perrin, getting in a final word.
 
All told, a clever juxtaposition of posh chic compared to the duo’s show for their own brand Monse on Friday night, which was an ode to posh punk, and a deconstructed evocation of Vivienne Westwood. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 10, 2020","Canadian fashion is set to take centre stage on February 13, on the eve of London Fashion Week.The event, dubbed 'A Celebration of Canadian Design', includes a VIP retailer and agent preview, a runway fashion show and a B2B networking reception.

The objective of the showcase is to provide market-entry opportunities for Canadian fashion designers. A total of eight Canadian designers will participate in the showcase, including evening wear designer David Dixon, Vancouver brand Studio Lorem Ipsum, and streetwear label Vandal. 

Other brands and designers include Alan Anderson, Adrian Arniere, Hania Kuzbari, Msichanaand Shelli Oh. 

It is expected to attract a notable list of UK and international retailers, sales agents and media including Net-A-Porter, MatchesFashion, and British Vogue, to name a few. 

The event will take place at the prestigious Canada House, Trafalgar Square, and is invitation-only. 

Launched in 2018, almost 50 export-ready apparel and accessory designers have participated in 'A Celebration of Canadian Design' since its debut, including many who have gained media recognition, secured orders with UK retailers and sealed deals with UK sales agents/distributors.

The fashion event is organized by Toronto Fashion Incubator (TFI), in partnership with the High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom, the City of Toronto, the Canada-UK Foundation, and the Trade Commissioner Service of Global Affairs Canada, among other event supporters.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 10, 2020","It was all about the materials at Sies Marjan on Sunday, the most significant European designer showing in New York this season.
 Novel and artisanal fabrics were worn by a cast that walked around the 54th floor of the brand new One Manhattan West building, a curvy skyscraper built two blocks west of Penn Station. Yet the blend of revolutionary fabric techniques, eye-popping biodynamic dyes and truly novel silhouettes meant the audience kept their focus on the collection and not on the view – a truly beautiful late afternoon vision of quite literally the majority of the island of Manhattan under a moody winter sky.
 
Marjan confessed his big inspiration this season was Dutch architect and fashion insider Rem Koolhaas, and his forthcoming exhibition in the Guggenheim Museum, named “Countryside, The Future.” This helped inject a rugged mood into this collection, notably with some great Donegal tweed, hailing from Ireland’s most remote county; and some hand-finished sweaters, courtesy of a family-owned factory on the Channel Island of Guernsey.
 
Marjan played on traditional rural workwear but he is such a naturally inventive designer that his dropped waists, angle seams and floaty volumes meant nothing looked remotely predictable or hackneyed.
 
He opened with some brilliant battered gold looks – a long crinkly sheath and a remarkable cheongsam, both worn by models carrying ginormous military kit bags in matching gold.
 
There were all sorts of unlikely dyeing finishes, one in particular from foliage found upstate in Ithaca which looked almost alive. Others – the result of a collaboration with Dutch textile artist Claudy Jongstra and visual artist Diana Scherer – turned root systems into tangled fabrics and looked pretty remarkable.
 
In a co-ed show he also sent out some craftily tailored suits with oversized double-breasted jackets, including one in a dark shamrock that was worthy of a Grammy winner. 
Most of the cast walked in clogs some with beveled platform heels, underlining this ode to rural ecology.
 
Marjan has grown to become one of the most celebrated of fashion’s current avant garde, and rightly so. Moreover, where in previous collection his color palette could sometimes be insipid, this range of hues was in full bloom.
 
In a word, excellent experimental fashion that brought the New York runway weekend alive.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 9, 2020","Tory Burch took her inspiration from fine art this season. Specifically, the quirkily offbeat and monumental ceramic sculptures of Francesca DiMattio, and the result was one of her most powerful collections to date.Patterns, images and odd objects all blend together in DiMattio’s art, just like in this collection, staged with skill on a sunny Sunday morning inside the looming auction rooms of Sotheby’s, located practically on the East River.
 
Burch borrowed 10 major works by the artist and positioned them throughout the auction rooms, so the cast interfaced with the artwork. DiMattio’s beasts – 10-foot-high poodles, thee-meter totem poles or candelabras with an eight-foot diameter – are eclectic pieces, where tiny figurines like wizened monkeys compete with fragmented floras and classic caryatids. In true Burch fashion, however, it all seemed hyper coherent.Starting with the great opening look worn by Natalia Vodianova, a floral pantsuit and knee-high boots combo in contrasting floral motifs that looked marvelous, and will be highly influential. The prints echoed a large ceramic greyhound anchoring one of the legs of DiMattio’s sculpture, named “She-Wolf.”
 
Even simpler items, like a crepe de chine top or Napa leather pants, referenced the art’s particular palette, as seen in another work called “Venus III.”
 
Burch varied the selection from Wild West prairie wedding dresses to strict gray mannish suiting. And there were echoes of JW Anderson in the askew composite frocks in huge patchworks of porcelain floral, crepe de chine and printed silk twill. Then again, as Burch’s stylist Benjamin Bruno is also part of Anderson’s cohort, that is perhaps a little inevitable.
 
“I’ve been an enormous fan of Francesca DiMattio for years. Her artwork challenges the traditional forms of femininity. She’s a great inspiration to me,” explained Burch post show.
 
Coolly, the designer kicked off with the show with a marvelous performance by singer Alice Smith, who strolled through around the artworks, micro in hand, singing some tremendous jazzy R&B.The show was also in effect the latest affirmation of Burch’s firm membership of the Gotha of American fashion – one of a half dozen designers who today define style in the USA. Doubly so in a New York season bereft of such luminaries as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Tom Ford.
 
New York has been the de facto artistic capital of the planet since the 1950s, so scores of New York designers have referenced favorite local artists in their collections before. But few have done so with such aplomb as Tory did today, in a thoroughly good display of clever contemporary style.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 9, 2020","Scenes of great adulation at Saturday night’s fashion show by Brandon Maxwell – screams, howls, hollers and endless ripples of applause throughout the performance.Cheering led, it turned out, by real cheerleaders from Navarro College, characters from the hit documentary series Cheer, who whooped pretty well every look in this show staged inside the American Museum of Natural History on Central Park West.
 
Maxwell’s cast marched around the remarkable exhibits inside the Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals, Bella Hadid sweeping past a stand of four giant stuffed moose in a brilliant cocktail hour combo of shawl-collar tuxedo, black latex-like bra and mannish silver sequined pants.Maxwell is a designer with plenty of range – cutting classical screen goddess columns and following them up with power-shoulder leather wrap jackets that Claude Montana would have applauded. Though his most exotic idea was a series of shiny coat dresses and jackets made in a techy tortoiseshell nylon. 
In this co-ed show, he also showed lots of great clobber for guys, largely on-duty playboy looks – micro Prince of Wales double-breasted blazers or dashing top coats worthy of Tamara de Lempicka.
 
A brilliant soundtrack by French DJ Sebastien Perrin – who seems to be everywhere these days – included dance classics and charming rock ballads, like “Girl Goin’ Nowhere” by Ashley McBryde, the Arkansas-born country music singer. A southerner like Texas-born Maxwell. 
 
In a generous gesture, Maxwell’s program dedicated the show to the “loving memory of Ed Filipowski,” the noted New York publicist who died last month.
 
In effect, Maxwell creates with infinitely more craft than any of his contemporaries in America. His clothes reek sophistication. Too often in New York, young designers rise and fall in a half decade of insider fame. Not Maxwell, who seems destined to have real staying power. Expect to hear a lot more about this Texan.
 
As a matter of fact, someone in Paris should really hire Brandon to direct a great haute couture house. Maxwell is that good.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 8, 2020","The international Fall/Winter 2020-21 women’s ready-to-wear runway season opened Friday evening in the heart of the world’s financial establishment, Wall Street. But the debut show by Monse was an ode to the greatest rebellion of the 1970s – punk rock.It was posh punk admittedly, delivered in a disused bank 50 meters away from where George Washington was sworn in as America’s first president in 1789. But it was also posh punk made in the preferred material of Johnny Rotten and Joe Strummer – tartan – cut askew with cunning swirls and angles and combinations.
 
The material could be seen in the meeting of a chopped-up classic khaki trench with décolleté shoulders, a slashed fire-engine-red blouse and a Clan Stewart tartan skirt. Or in a superb rocker’s cocktail made of vertical shards of contrasting plaids.For evening, we got a hint of Siouxsie and the Banshees, though as if she had earned an Oscar nomination and showed up on the red carpet in a sliced silver sequined column, worn with military gear.  Everything finished with oversized safety pins and Vietnam vet boots.
 
“We wanted that proper British punk look. That energy but with plenty of the deconstruction we love,” explained Monse founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim in the basement backstage. 
The partly co-ed show also featured a great punk safari He Man look with a cheetah-print sweater and matching scarf worn with skinny Sid Vicious pants. The chasseur turned out to be James Turlington, nephew of Christy, who looked born for the catwalk – which of course he is.

Worn by a fresh New York casting, and perfectly styled with the right mix of pep and poise by Ada Kokosar, this was an excellent opening blast of fashion, the first of some 300 runway shows over the next four weeks.
 
It was a sassy Sex Pistol punch, retro but in rude health. And plenty different from the Monse duo’s uptown job designing Oscar de la Renta, which they will stage on Monday night in the New York Public Library.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 8, 2020","American creator Christian Siriano kicked off New York Fashion Week with a gleeful mix of comics, cubism and glamour, in the build up to Sunday's Oscars where he could well triumph.The young designer, based in New York since he was 22, has become one of the city's biggest fashion attractions over the last few years with the exit of several big names. His outfits are sought out and worn by stars on the red carpet.

This season he drew inspiration from characters and emotions from the DC Comics superhero film ""Birds of Prey"".""The whole idea was everybody has a little inner Harley Quinn in them,"" Siriano, referring to the movie's main character, told AFP before the show.

Quinn, the Joker's former companion, is an extreme anti-hero who sways between good and evil.

The 34-year-old Siriano sought to make her ""more romantic, beautiful, elegant"" and didn't skimp on the sequins, velvet and shimmering fabric to make his creations shine.

It is par for the course for this master of the spectacle who added his touch of glamour with long robes, padded shoulders and opulent materials, velvet in particular.

The designer also took flamenco by the arm, using its frills and traditional Cordobes hats as well as -- more daringly -- cubism. The last outfits of the collection were all formed of angles.

While designers increasingly ponder the relevance of the catwalk, Siriano is clear: it is part and parcel of what he does.

""Fashion is so hard right now. It's rough. But this is my dream fantasy world. So I feel if we didn't have this some of my clothes wouldn't make sense anymore and that's so sad,"" he said.

""That's why I get up everyday to do this job because I like the dream world of it.""

""I take a lot of risks and I think people are intrigued by that hopefully. You never know who's going to sit front row, you never really what the shapes are going to be. So I hope that gets people coming back.""

Hollywood's darling, Siriano is living a high-stakes, high-stress moment, with Thursday's show and the Oscars on Sunday.

""It's the worse. Half my team is at my studio right now,"" preparing the outfits that will grace Sunday's red carpet.

""It's so hard. It's the hardest we've ever had.""Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Feb 7, 2020","Stockholm-based fashion house Tiger of Sweden announced on Thursday the appointment of Bryan Conway as design director. Effective since February 3, 2020, Conway replaces Christoffer Lundman who exited the premium-contemporary brand last month, after the company and the designer “mutually agreed to part ways after two years.""

Conway has been a part of the Tiger of Sweden family since May 2019, as head of menswear design. In his new role, he will now take the creative lead for the Tiger Men’s, Women’s, Jeans and accessories lines. 

“The combination of skills Bryan brings to Tiger of Sweden is very rare to find in a creative talent: He has a distinct creative point of view on the brand, deep competency in craftsmanship, a relentless drive for innovation and an open-minded, curious attitude. I am looking forward to shaping the future of Tiger of Sweden together with him,” said CEO Linda Dauriz, in a news statement. 

Prior to joining Tiger of Sweden, Conway spent six years working closely with Christopher Bailey, finishing his time at Burberry with the responsibility of leading the menswear runway team, before moving to work with Jonathan Anderson, as the senior menswear designer at JW Anderson.

Conway’s first collections for Tiger of Sweden will be shown from Spring/Summer 2021.

The Swedish brand has had its challenges in recent years, including a struggle to return to sales growth. It welcomed CEO Dauriz in November, following the departure of Hans-Christian Meyer. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 7, 2020","Reebok and The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) have teamed up to sponsor five up-and-coming designers featured during New York Fashion Week: Men's. Continuing a partnership that began in 2018 to foster new fashion talent, the CFDA and Reebok let designers re-imagine Reebok's most popular sneaker models--including the Club C, Classic Nylon and Classic Leather, as well as the Zig Kinetica, one of Reebok's newest silhouettes -- with Reebok providing support and mentorship. 

The selected menswear designers include Kenneth Nicholson, a Los Angeles-based designer whose namesake label, launched in 2016, is partially inspired by his military background; NIHL, a brand owned and founded by artist and designer Neil Patrick Grotzinger; Keenkee, a New York-based label founded by Seoul-born designer Kee Kim in 2018; Paa, the sophisticated ‘normcore’ brand founded by Peter Jurado and Al Verik; and Victor Li, the eponymous New York-based 'pancultural' menswear brand known for its knitwear. To promote the 2020 partnership, Reebok and the CFDA hosted an immersive experience featuring each designer’s shoe -- along with sketches, swatches and mood boards depicting the design process -- during the men's fashion week, which hit a new low for designer participation this season with only 23 labels on its calendar. 

“Our continued partnership with the CFDA enables us to discover, grow and empower the next generation of American designers,” said Karen Reuther, Reebok VP creative direction and future.

“Through industry exposure, close mentorships and unparalleled experience in design, our goal is to support these promising designers with a foundation that will propel them onto the next stage of their creative journeys.” 

“Reebok’s continued support and mentorship provides emerging talents with the opportunity to develop their brands in new and modern ways,” said Mark Beckham, CFDA’s vice president of marketing and events.

“Access to Reebok’s global expertise gives these small, entrepreneurial designers valuable tools to take their businesses to the next level.”

"Feb 6, 2020","One year ago, Tom Ford took over as Chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, as the industry heralded the dawn of a new era for American fashion.Ford promised a far more internationalist approach; greater support for young designers and a more concise season. However, 12 months later, as editors, retailers and influencers descend on New York for the fall winter 2020/21 collections, the whole season is strikingly denuded of many of its major names; beginning with Tom Ford himself. Ford will be presenting his latest show in Los Angeles on Friday evening, the very first day of the women’s collections in New York.

Moreover, despite his best efforts, under its current combined format New York Fashion Week now sprawls over 10 days, from Monday, February 3 with menswear presentations to Wednesday, February 12, climaxing – as has become tradition – with a final show by Marc Jacobs.Remarkably, the four historically largest fashion houses founded in New York by American designers - Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger will also be absent.  At least, Hilfiger is still staging a show, but in London. The All-American talent will take his latest See-Now-Buy-Now concept on the road again with a show in Blighty, during the UK runway season.

Several other must-see names are also absent – from Jeremy Scott, who will now show during Paris couture, with speculation that he is miffed by Ford scheduling his show for the same evening as Scott’s; Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss, who is skipping a season as he tries a novel manner of unveiling his collections; and Tomo Koizumi – the cult show of September.

The city is also bracing for a huge downturn in attendance by Chinese buyers, stylists and editors due to the Coronavirus. In Milan, the Camera della Moda is predicting there will be some 1,000 less Chinese visitors at that city’s fashion week, debuting on February 19. Chinese fashion houses Angel Chen, Ricostru and Hui have canceled their runway shows in Milan Fashion because of the virus.That said, New York does still have some major players – especially in its key resource – great American sportswear. Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Coach; along with sophisticated labels for Park Avenue mavens or wealthy loft dwellers - Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang. Plus insiders are tipping a diverse new group of non-NYC talent like Sukeina's Senegalese creator Omar Salam, Grenadian designer Fe Noel, or Queens born LaQuan Smith.

Another major flaw in the NYC season is that it is spilt in two. Most of the important shows are listed on the Official Schedule of the CFDA. However, IMG’s rival NYFW The Shows, much of which is staged inside Spring Studios in the downtown neighborhood of Tribeca, has a separate, and confusingly overlapping listing. And, remarkably, this NYFW list also begins with an event in LA: M Missoni's runway for the launch of Margherita Missoni’s new youth-orientated collection.

Underlining the suddenly magnetic attraction of LA, the French independent couturier Julie de Libran presented the collection she had unveiled in Paris last month with a trunk show in genteel Hancock Park, with Matches Fashion on Wednesday night.

So unusual is this season that it turns out the anchor event of the opening day, will not actually be a fashion show, but a celebration inside a department store. Expect huge attention when legendary buyer Linda Fargo and the singer and fashion star Rihanna celebrate the launch of Fenty in Bergdorf Goodman.

When revealing his decision to decamp to LA, Tom Ford said the following: “In my role as chairman of the CFDA, my main intent and priority is to globalize and bring attention to American fashion. There is truly no bigger or more prominent stage in the world at any given time than Los Angeles during the Academy Awards.”

All perfectly true, but the net result is a suddenly less prominent stage for fashion in New York.

"Feb 6, 2020","The house of Azzaro has appointed Olivier Theyskens to be its new Artistic Director, in a surprise move sure to receive an enthusiastic response in fashion.Theyskens will be in charge of the brand’s Couture collections, Ready-to-Wear lines, and Women’s and Men’s accessories, said the house in a release. The appointment marks a significant shift in Paris fashion, as Theyskens has always been regarded as one of the industry’s most naturally gifted designers.

“I am very happy. There is this great heritage in Azzaro that I am very excited to discover and impatient to interpret. There is still a great deal of positivity around the great years of the house. People have very good, fond memories of Loris Azzaro,” Theyskens told FashionNetwork.com.Born in Brussels, and a graduate of the city’s famed La Cambre fashion and design college, the Belgian designer will unveil his first collection for Azzaro during the next haute couture catwalk season in Paris, in July 2020. He will be based in the house’s workshops, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Though Theyskens added that he will continue to create collections for his own house. His next signature runway show is scheduled for Friday, February 28.

“Loris Azzaro left behind a considerable, very inspiring legacy. I am excited, thrilled and honored to have the opportunity of bringing my vision to this legendary, iconoclastic House, for which freedom and pleasure remain ever-as-contemporary founding values. I would like to carry on this atypical universe through my collections, while infusing them with my own perspective,” said the designer.

Back in 1998, Theyskens catapulted to global fame when he was only 20 years old, when Madonna wore one of his black satin dresses to the Oscars. The Belgian 43-year-old creator has gone on to become a highly experienced designer. Four years after his Oscar moment, he was named creative director of Rochas, and won the CFDA International Award in 2006, while still in his twenties. After Rochas’ owner Procter & Gamble closed down that house’s fashion business, Theyskens moved on to become the artistic director of Nina Ricci, dressing Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Jessica Parker on the red carpet. From 2010 to 2015 he was the creative director of Theory in New York, renamed in his honor Theyskens’ Theory, before departing to concentrate on his own signature collection back in Paris. At every stage winning critical acclaim for his bold draping, subtle use of historical references and careful dosage of tough chic.

Azzaro’s CEO Gabriel de Linage heralded Theyskens' arrival: “His renowned talent, experience and creative vision will empower the House's future with spirit and sparkle. Olivier Theyskens has a unique ability to immerse himself in a legacy and to revisit it with a contemporary verve. His fondness for asserted sensuousness and the flowing contrasts of materials and cuts naturally echo the style of Loris Azzaro and his emblematic muses. We are thrilled to welcome him to our House and to our historical workshops.”

Born to Sicilian immigrant parents and raised in Tunisia, Loris Azzaro launched his fashion house in 1967 in Paris. Going on to become couturier to the Jet Set, and dressing Brigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch and Liza Minelli in the smash hit cult film, Cabaret. In 1988, President François Mitterrand awarded the Légion d’honneur to Azzaro, who created a signature high-glamour style that blended body-conscious dressing with the dramatic use of pearls, precious stones and fantasy costume jewelry.

After the founder’s death in 2003, the house has gone through a series of designers – including Vanessa Seward, Mathilde Castello Branco and Maxime Simoëns – though Theyskens is unquestionably the most famous to have bene entrusted Azzaro, which since 2006 has been owned by Reig Capital.

"Feb 4, 2020","“China, we are with you,” is the slogan that will inaugurate Milan’s next women’s fashion week, from February 18-24. As the coronavirus epidemic intensifies, the National Chamber of Italian Fashion has declared its solidarity with China. The campaign is twofold, with a special event and multiple video conferences that will take place between both countries all week.“We made the decision last week, when it became clear that a barrier was separating China from the rest of the world. During our fashion weeks, we typically have a thousand visitors from this country, whether it be buyers, journalists or designers. Almost 80% of them won’t be able to make it this year. Only a few hundred will join us, and they’re the Chinese visitors who were already in Europe at the time of the outbreak,” explained Carlo Capasa, the president of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) during a conference in Milan this Tuesday.

Milan Fashion Week has announced 56 runways the 2020/21 season dedicated to ready-to-wear for fall-winter. Moncler, Ports 1961 and Philipp Plein will be returning, accompanied by Gilberto Calzolari and Vìen, who will be showing for the first time. The opening of the fashion week will take place on the evening of February 18, with the Chinese solidarity campaign. The opening of the Fashion Hub Market, a space dedicated to emerging creators, will serve as the backdrop for the event.“We would like to forge a bridge between Italy and China, using technology. The idea is to have the Chinese virtually participate in the Milan Fashion Week, even though they aren’t able to attend. We would like for it to be as if they are there. Eight young Chinese stylists will be given the chance to participate in the Fashion Hub Market. This will be achieved through pre-recorded video discussions and figures that will allow them to present their projects and encourage us to discuss their current situation,” said Capasa.
The eight emerging brands were selected via Fashion Town, the Chinese-Italian platform offered by the Chic retail group, who participated in the selection of Xun Ruo, Leaf Xia, Han Wen, Pinhui Zhao, Emma Sweet, Zijue, Dot Minute et Shengyi Liu. In addition, a Chinese brand, with a presence in Europe and the US, is expected to show. Its name will be revealed in the coming days.

However, some Chinese designers based in Italy and Europe who typically show at Milan Fashion Week, won’t be participating this time around due to late shipments from China. Angel Chen and Shuting Qiu are among them.

With this campaign, the Camera della Moda has also set out to create Chinese content, such as runways content, interviews and backstage images, in order to “share the fashion week with all of those stuck at home and bring it to life.”  A team has been tasked with the project and is working on setting up interactions with the Chinese public.

In the meantime, Italian fashion has already been economically penalized by the impact of the coronavirus.

“For the first semester of 2020, the sector’s revenue should decline by 1.8%, particularly from January to March, which will clearly jeopardize our annual results,” added Capasa.

"Feb 4, 2020","Tod’s has linked up with the noted Japanese designer brand Mame Kurogouchi for its latest T Factory collaboration.First launched in September 2018 with a collaboration with Alessandro Dell’Acqua, T Factory is a series of “conversations” with creatives. The title is short for Tod’s Factory and references Andy Warhol’s famed art studio in Lower Manhattan, The Factory, back in the 60s.
 
At the time of the launch, Tod’s owner, Italian luxury billionaire Diego Della Valle, bragged that he already had the next three creators lined up.  Its second design partnership was the highly mediatic link-up with former Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz, named Happy Moments and featuring pop-colored and metallic loafers or moccasins – especially Tod’s signature gommino model.According to Tod’s, Mame Kurogouchi's T Factory project will interpret “the world of Tod's women’s accessories and Ready-to-Wear with her take on craftsmanship and timeless elegance.”
 
Mame Kurogouchi was founded in Japan in 2010 by Maiko Kurogouchi, going on to win the Fashion Prize of Tokyo in 2017. She has also presented and showed her collections in Paris, winning consistently warm reviews. Critics have admired her brainy and unexpected mélange of beautiful printing techniques, offbeat yet elegant proportions and blend of ancient artisan with techy technical touches.
 
T Factory is effectively Tod's creative laboratory invented to harness unconventional projects with designers and artists from the world of luxury and creativity. They can tap into “the brand’s iconographic heritage, Italian artisanal excellence and know-how, which they translate based on their point of view in total freedom,” Tod’s said in a release.
 
T Factory’s initial collections were designed to retail in close to 100 stores, principally flagships, in the network of some 300 sales points where Tod’s retails.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 3, 2020","Desigual presented a new image at its headquarters in Barcelona last year, and the event sent a clear message: the company owned and led by Thomas Meyer wants to do things differently. It marked an evolution of the brand’s irreverent approach, which would also shape the way it presents its collections. As the company’s chief marketing officer told FashionNetwork.com, “we are testing a new strategy outside of the fashion week calendar to link our products to artistic and cultural moments rather than purely fashion.” And so, after years of taking part in Madrid and Barcelona fashion week, Desigual held an event at Art Basel in Miami in December to present its 2020 collection.The ‘Miami Loves Different’ show was directed by artist Carlota Guerrero, who recruited about 30 models to wear the collection. It ended with a display of love and sensuality in a performance that explored the power of the kiss. Social media reacted almost immediately, and the event attracted significant media attention. According to data from Launchmetrics, which measured the show’s media impact value in the period between 1 December and 14 December 2019 through its proprietary MIV algorithm, traditional media generated the most buzz. Online media accounted for 49% of mentions, including stories run by German newspaper Bild (which generated €55,508 in MIV), and the UK’s MailOnSunday and DailyMail, worth €35,829 and €35,791 respectively. Many blogs also covered the story, focusing primarily on the fact that the cast included Madonna’s daughter Lourdes León.

While Desigual’s owned media accounted for just 7.3% of the impact, celebrities and influencers helped drive the company’s MIV up, accounting for 10.9% and 25.1% of the total value. The three most influential social media posts, shared by influencer Macarena Achaga, music artist Greta Menchi and model Jazzelle Zanaughtti on Instagram, generated up to €1 million in MIV. Meanwhile, the most valuable accounts were Macarena Achaga’s, which delivered €247,077 in value, Desigual’s with an MIV of €176,975, and Miranda Makaroff, whose collaboration with the brand resulted in €131,549 in MIV.By region, Spain dominated as the most valuable country, generating €532,100 or 24% of the total value, followed by the US with €369,600, Mexico with €340,200, Italy with €228,600 and the UK with €222,300. According to the Launchmetrics study, Europe’s contribution was largely the same as the MIV recorded in the Americas.

The data reveals how much online buzz Desigual’s event generated in the two weeks after the show, but the real results will come in the form of sales later this year. In the first half of the year, revenues at the Spanish brand fell 10% to €290.7 million, but Ebitda rose 22.1% to €27.2 million.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Feb 1, 2020","As it continues its repositioning efforts one year after the departure of its creative director, Raf Simons, Calvin Klein has called in another Belgian designer: Tim Coppens. The New York-based, PVH-owned brand has given the designer a temporary role as consultant design director at its Calvin Klein ready-to-wear line. 
""Calvin Klein, Inc. has hired Tim Coppens as consultant design director for menswear at our Calvin Klein business, exclusively for products distributed in Asia under license through our partner Club 21,"" explained the American company. Calvin Klein is the brand's contemporary apparel line. 
 
Thus far, the group has given no further details. Following a complicated 2019, Calvin Klein is yet to find its new creative director. Last March, the brand discontinued its high-end Calvin Klein 205W39NYC line (formerly known as Calvin Klein Collection), and its iconic Madison Avenue store was also closed. A number of employees were dismissed in New York but also in Milan, where Calvin Klein closed its offices in spring in order to integrate the remainder of this workforce into its European HQ in Amsterdam. In June Cheryl Abel-Hodges became CEO. 

Having graduated from Antwerp's Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 1998, Tim Coppens set himself up in New York, where he founded the luxury sportswear label that bears his name in 2011. He has collaborated with the likes of Ralph Lauren RLX, Bogner, Adidas and Under Armour Sportswear, among others. It remains to be seen if this experiment at Calvin Klein might lead to a longer lasting partnership with the brand. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 31, 2020","World Athletics announced significant changes to its rules on Friday that will outlaw some variants of Nike's Vaporfly running shoes and introduce strict limits to the technology developed for any future shoes used in elite competition.The sport's governing body (WA) said that with immediate effect, road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded plate.

The Vaporfly shoes used by Eliud Kipchoge to run the first sub-2 hour marathon and by fellow Kenyan Brigid Kosgei to smash the women's marathon world record both contained triple carbon plates inside thick, ultra-compressed foam, said by Nike to help improve running economy by up to four percent.The new rules also state that, from April 30, any shoe used in competition must have been generally available to the public for four months - putting paid to the use by Nike and others of prototypes by its athletes in major races.

There will also be new rules governing the construction of track spikes.

WA's review concluded that the new technology ""may provide a performance advantage and could raise concerns that it might threaten the integrity of the sport"".

WA will now establish an expert working group to guide future research into shoe technology and to assess new shoes that emerge on the market.

Nike did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the decision.

"Jan 29, 2020","In what amounts to a return to her roots, Alberta Ferretti will organize her next cruise show in Rimini, Italy, according to American media reports. The show will be held on May 22 of this year.This year's cruise show season is set to be an exceptional one, with plenty of sunny and iconic destinations, which are rich in symbolic significance. A case in point is the latest event announced by Alberta Ferretti, who has chosen to return to her native region to present her cruise collection. On May 22, the designer will convene the fashion sphere in the city of Rimini on the Adriatic coast for a show that will pay tribute to a film legend, WWD reported.

The fashion house aims to take advantage of the mid-season show to celebrate the memory of Federico Fellini, who was born in Rimini 100 years ago, the journal said.Alberta Ferretti is not alone in presenting her cruise collection in Italy.

"Jan 29, 2020","As applications open for its 31st edition, ANDAM (France's Association Nationale pour le Développement des Arts de la Mode) has announced that Cédric Charbit, CEO of Balenciaga and member of Kering's executive committee, is the competition's new designated mentor. Balenciaga, which has achieved popularity and success under creative director Demna Gvasalia, recently announced its return to Haute Couture. Charbit succeeds Renzo Rosso in the role of ANDAM mentor. Last year, the founder and president of Italian fashion group OTB (owner of Diesel and Maison Margiela, among others) awarded the prize to Christelle Kocher, founder and designer of ready-to-wear brand Koché. Global production and distribution of her brand have since been licensed to OTB. 

Founded in 1989 by Nathalie Dufour, with the support of France's Ministry of Culture and Communication, and the DEFI, the fashion competition dedicated to young design will also welcome two new sponsors this year: L'Oréal Paris – already an official partner of Paris Fashion Week – and Google France. The pair join Chanel, Chloé, the Fondation Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent, Galeries Lafayette, Hermès, Kering, Lacoste, Longchamp, LVMH, OTB, Saint Laurent, Swarovski, Tomorrow London Holdings, design and manufacturing group OBO, and trade show organisers Première Classe.

As in previous editions, ANDAM 2020 will award four prizes: the grand prize, worth 250,000 euros; the Pierre Bergé prize, which replaces the creative label prize (100,000 euros); the fashion accessories prize (50,000 euros); and the innovation prize, which was introduced in 2017 and is also worth 50,000 euros. 

The competition will therefore award a total of 450,000 euros this year. Winning brands will also take part in a mentoring programme offered by ANDAM's sponsors. Applications close on 27 April and the list of finalists will be revealed in May, while the competition's winners will be announced on 2 July 2020. 

As well as Koché, which received the grand prize at the competition's 30th edition, ANDAM awarded the Pierre Bergé prize to French designer Nicolas Lecourt Mansion in 2019, while the accessories prize went to Khaore, an ethical, New York-based brand founded in 2017 by Wei Hung Chen and Raiheth Rawla.

"Jan 29, 2020","According to a new study from data analytics firm Launchmetrics, sustainability and diversity are two of the biggest themes currently driving the changing conversation around fashion weeks, as formats and front rows continue to evolve.The latest of Launchmetrics’ annual “Data on the Runway” reports uses the firm’s propriety machine learning algorithm to calculate Media Impact Value (MIV) and quantify the impact generated by different brands during the fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris for the Fall/Winter 2019 and Spring/Summer 2020 seasons.
 
The report highlights Christian Dior as a brand that was able to tap into the ongoing discussion about sustainability in the fashion industry with its SS20 runway show in Paris, when it teamed up with botanist group Coloco to fill its show space with trees for a message on biodiversity.The move helped drive the brand’s MIV up 57% to $13 million, compared to the $8.6 million generated by its show for FW19.
 
Gucci and Burberry also addressed the sustainability conversation by hosting carbon-neutral shows for SS20, a decision which helped create buzz for both brands and pushed Gucci’s MIV up to $9.6 million, a 40% increase compared to FW19.
 
And it’s not just the major players that are benefitting from aligning themselves with sustainable issues: one of the strongest gains was seen at Gabriela Hearst, whose carbon-neutral show – an industry first – helped drive the brand’s MIV up 258% from FW19 to SS20.
 
In terms of diversity, Launchmetrics singled out the Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya show in New York as having one of the most diverse and inclusive runways of the SS20 fashion week season, a fact which the analytics firm credits with pushing significant improvements in the brand’s MIV, which totaled $10 million.
 
Ultimately, Tommy Hilfiger generated the third highest MIV of any brand during New York Fashion Week SS20, and the eighth highest across all of the big four weeks.
 
Embracing diversity off the runway also pays off for brands, as shown by the fact that two of the most impactful influencers at London Fashion Week SS20 were drag queens and Ru Paul’s Drag Race alums Miss Fame and Aquaria.
 
Miss Fame sat front row at the Erdem show and generated an impressive MIV of $319,000 for the brand with 10 publications, while Aquaria contributed an MIV of $207,000 to the Matty Bovan show she attended with just two publications. 
In turn, these contributions reflect wider changes occurring on the front rows of fashion shows. Although media still dominates the conversation, providing 47.5% of total MIV across New York, London, Milan and Paris in FW19, and 50.3% in SS20, influencers continue to be an increasingly important presence at fashion shows.
 
Indeed, 100% of the top social posts during SS20 came from influencers or celebrities, with the total MIV generated by said social posts increasing to $415.2 million, compared to $250.9 million in FW19.
 
Picking the right celebrities and influencers to invite to shows is therefore an important decision and brands will need to take new factors and perspectives into account as the landscape of the luxury sector evolves.
 
India, for example, contributed the third largest MIV of any country to Michael Kors’ FW19 show, thanks in large part to the interest drummed up by Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, who generated the most buzz out of the event’s guests.
 
As countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and particularly China became increasingly important markets for the luxury industry, it’s clear that brands will need to be aware of the voices that can help them reach these new consumers.
 
Overall, of the big four, New York Fashion Week saw the strongest increase in MIV between FFW19 and SS20, as the figure more than doubled from $117.7 million to $257.5 million season over season.
 
Launchmetrics attributes this impressive gain, at least in part, to the new format of the event, which was cut down from nine to five and a half days following the appointment of Tom Ford as the new chairman of the CFDA, leading to a more focused and intense experience.
 
In terms of brands, the top three MIVs for FW19 were achieved by Chanel ($9.2 million), Dior ($8.6 million) and Gucci ($8.3 million), while Victoria Beckham ($8.2 million) and Burberry ($7.9 million) rounded out the top five.
 
For SS20, Versace snatched the top spot with an MIV of $21.7 million, pushing Chanel ($19.7 million) into second place, followed by Michael Kors ($16.5 million), Balmain ($16 million) and Dior ($13 million).Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 28, 2020","Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW) unveiled its previously flagged Sustainability Action Plan 2020-2022 on Tuesday, the plan being designed to “reinforce the event's sustainability profile and, more importantly, to push the industry to accelerate its sustainability efforts”. It involves ambitious actions that will impact all those labels showing at the event.At a press conference just before the official opening show of the event, CFW’s chief executive Cecilie Thorsmark said that “all industry players — including fashion weeks — have to be accountable for their actions and be willing to change the way business is done”.

She added that “the timeframe for averting the devastating effects of climate change on the planet and people is less than a decade, and we're already witnessing its catastrophic impacts today. Put simply, there can be no status quo.”Her aim is that CFW can “go from being a traditional event to being a platform for industry change”.

So what does the plan involve? It has two arms, the first presenting how the event itself will transition to greater sustainability. That includes initiatives such as reducing its climate impact by 50% and rethinking waste systems in all aspects of event production. Zero waste is its goal for 2022. 

But it wants to influence the wider industry too and Thorsmark  added that the plan additionally “focuses on the bigger picture by outlining how [CFW] will implement sustainability requirements and set new standards for participation to push the industry toward necessary, comprehensive change”.

In practice, this means that from January 2023, all brands that want to stage a show or presentation at the event “must meet minimum sustainability requirements to participate in the official show schedule, as presented in the action plan's 2023 Sustainability Requirements”.

The are 17 minimum standards, such as “pledging not to destroy unsold clothes, using at least 50% certified, organic, upcycled or recycled textiles in all collections, using only sustainable packaging and having zero-waste set designs for their shows”. Meeting these standards will be assessed by a points system.

A pilot test will happen this year to collect data on the current baseline “to determine the score required to participate in 2023”.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 28, 2020","Jeremy Scott has cancelled his upcoming runway show in New York, in a move that will significantly weaken the American fashion catwalk season. Instead, the Kansas-born designer will stage future shows in Paris, beginning with haute couture in July.Scott had been scheduled to show on Friday, February 7 at 8pm, which effectively made his catwalk event the first major show on the official calendar of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the governing body of fashion in the United States.

“Jeremy Scott will no longer be showing his Fall Winter 2020 collection during New York Fashion Week. In a move to pay homage to the city that launched his design career, Jeremy Scott will show his upcoming collection in Paris in July,” the designer announced in a terse statement.Back in 1997, Scott made his show debut will his fledgling signature brand in a bar near Bastille, and showed in Paris until 2001, when he left to live in Los Angeles.

Though the 45-year-old designer did not explain the reasons behind the cancellation, his move will in part be seen as reaction to the decision of the CFDA’s new chairman Tom Ford to move his own show from New York to Los Angeles this coming month. Ford will stage his show at 7pm local time, in other words what would have been three hours after Scott. And two days before the Academy Awards in LA.

Given Ford’s connection to the movie industry, his show risks overshadowing the whole NYC season, and certainly Scott’s show, which in recent years has been the opening anchor event of the season in Manhattan.

Scott’s departure will further diminish the season in New York, which will already be missing some of the biggest designer brands in America. Ralph Lauren still has not revealed his plans, and is not currently listed on the official CFDA schedule. Tommy Hilfiger will be busy showing in London with his latest See Now Buy Now show. And Calvin Klein has not shown on any catwalk since firing Raf Simons two years ago.

"Jan 27, 2020","The Federation of Haute Couture and Fashion, French fashion’s governing body, has released the schedule for next month’s runway season in Paris, inviting four new designers onto its official calendar.It granted two Paris-based houses, Coperni and Gauchere; Kenneth Ize of Nigeria and Noir Kei Ninomiya of Japan much coveted slots on the official schedule, guaranteeing them far greater media and commercial attention for their shows.
 
The Fall/Winter 2020/21 season is scheduled to run from Monday, Feb. 24 to Tuesday March 3, bringing to a close a month of shows that kick off Tuesday Feb. 4 in New York. The season will also witness one major debut at an established house, when Felipe Oliveira Baptista unveils his first ideas for Kenzo.

All eyes will be on Kenneth Ize, an energetic and optimistic young talent who was a finalist in the 2019 LVMH Prize. Ninomiya is a Comme des Garçons alumnus who remains part of that extended design realm. He has also participated in season two of Moncler Genius, winning acclaim for his all black, faux-armour-plated take on the iconic puffer.  Coperni, composed of the French duo of Arnaud Vaillant and Sébastien Meyer, has staged several presentations since launching back in 2013. While Gauchere, which despite its French sounding name, was founded by a German designer Marie-Christine Statz, has previously staged indie shows, but not on the official listing.
 
In effect, the new foursome take up slots on the calendar freed up by the departure of Afterhomework, Manish Arora, Cédric Charlier and Yang Li.
 
The federation also included four other houses who will stage presentations on the events listing. They are Boyarovskaya, Germanier and Xuly Bët of France, and Thebe Magugu of South Africa.
 
Magugu was the winner of last year’s LVMH Prize, so expect plenty of fashionistas to attend his Paris debut. Both Ize and Magugu already appeared in a joint show in Tokyo in October last year, as part of a cultural exchange program between Africa and Japan.

"Jan 27, 2020","Alessandra Facchinetti has been named creative director of Harlan + Holden, an Asian fashion company that defines itself as the world’s first “time-saving” clothing brand.  

The appointment marks Facchinetti's return to a leadership job in fashion since her departure from Tod’s in May 2016, after a three-year stint at the Italian moccasin and leather specialist.  A highly experienced designer, the 47-year-old Facchinetti had previously been womenwwear designer of Gucci for two years following the dismissal of Tom Ford in 2004. In 2007, she was also named the successor of Valentino Garavani at his couture house, following the retirement of the Roman couturier.  

“I’m very honored and excited to join Harlan + Holden as their first Creative Director. I’ve always been attracted by new projects that leverage a different language to express my creativity and experiences. Harlan + Holden have asked me to create a lifestyle uniform for women and men under a brand mission mandate to save time. To save time to focus on the things that matter. I appreciate the challenge and take on board this innovative philosophy, especially in a time where the way we approach life is changing rapidly across cultures,” said Facchinetti, who was born in the northern Italian city of Bergamo.   Her first collection for Harlan + Holden, named 9bc, will be released in June.  

Founded in Manila in 2015, and headquartered in Seoul, Harlan + Holden describes itself as being “in the business of saving people’s time.” The brand was founded by Emmanuel Pineda, and retails women’s and menswear.

The brand is clearly ambitious and has hired star architect David Chipperfield - who counts Valentino among his clients - to design its new flagship in Lotte Mall, Korea.

"Jan 26, 2020","In a joint press release, Pitti Immagine and CNMI, the Italian Fashion Chamber, have announced the calendar of the 2021 winter menswear shows in Italy. Compared to this year, the dates of the Pitti Uomo show in Florence and of the Milan Fashion Week Men’s have been pushed back by a few days. 
Pitti Uomo 99 is in fact scheduled from January 12 to 15 2021, and the Milan Fashion Week Men’s from January 16 to 19.
 
The new calendar is likely to please industry professionals. This year, many Pitti Uomo exhibitors complained about the event’s early start, on January 7, too close to the end of the Christmas vacation and coinciding with the start of the end-of-season sales period. The new dates are also likely to have an effect on the presence of buyers and dealers at the shows.“I believe that the dates chosen for the men's fashion weeks in 2021 will enable [the events] to consolidate and improve the positive results recorded in recent seasons, allowing Florence and Milan once again to play a central role in the international menswear calendar,” said Carlo Capasa, president of CNMI.
 
“Together, Milan and Florence promote the Italian fashion industry’s major labels and leading companies, but they also have a duty to represent the interests of the top buyers of high-quality fashion, who find a significant number of their important clients at our events. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the international distribution sector in order to offer increasingly advanced, sophisticated services,” said Claudio Marenzi, president of show organiser Pitti Immagine.

"Jan 24, 2020","Amiri, the brand led by designer Mike Amiri, is suing Zara in the U.S., alleging that the Spanish retailer copied its AMIRI MX2 jeans and sold them under the name Combination Skinny Biker jeans.The American company, which filed its complaint in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, is demanding $3 million in compensation from Inditex's flagship brand.

In the filing, Amiri claims that unique elements from its design, such as pleated leather panels and zip openings at the knee, have been reproduced in the jeans made by Zara, which currently do not appear to be for sale on the retailer's e-commerce website.In contrast, Amiri is still selling its AMIRI MX2 jeans on the menswear section of its e-commerce platform for a price of $1,150.00. 

This isn't the first time that Zara and other Inditex brands have faced accusations of plagiarism. Last summer, Cuban brand Clandestina sent an ironic message to the Spanish company after noticing that Zara was producing pieces featuring mottos that were similar to those on its own t-shirts. In 2016, American artist Tuesday Bassen also claimed that the Galician company had copied her designs and used them on its clothing. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 24, 2020","The winter edition of the Rome Fashion Week opened on January 23 with a panel discussion staged by organiser Altaroma, focusing on the issue of circularity in fashion, something of a common thread connecting the event’s various presentations and catwalk shows. In the inaugural address however, Ivan Scalfarotto, Italy’s under-secretary for foreign affairs, first highlighted the need for a team effort in support of Italian fashion: “Italy is a divided country, but we must remember that the only real competition is global. We have three cities playing different roles: Milan, Florence and Rome, which has been able to carve a very smart niche for itself with Altaroma, looking for emerging fashion talent. The only thing Rome needs to do is have greater belief in its role.”

The panel discussion then concentrated on how fashion is responding to environmental issues, creating greener products that in turn foster greater public awareness. Promoting circularity in fashion means for example using recycled materials, and natural dyes rather than toxic chemical ones, as the young designers on the panel emphasised.YOUNG LABELS' ECO FOCUS

Caterina Moro explained how her label, founded in 2018, specialises in printed natural fabrics. “Sustainability is a conquest, a process you perfect,” she said, adding that “I’m still not 100% sustainable, but I try to get there through the recycled materials I find travelling the length and breadth of Italy. Bio Italy, a company that collects waste material, has given me wood waste from the car industry which I use for my prints.” Cristiano Ferilli, 26, from Apulia, is an artisanal producer of eyeglasses frames made with a fibre called Sicalindi, obtained from prickly pears, a plant common in his region. Eleonora Riccio, an Academy of Fashion student, makes dyes from natural elements, and presented a wonderful, Swarovski-embroidered evening gown dyed with a red cabbage extract. Chiara Catone and her partner also work on printing fabrics using dyes made from natural ingredients.

Silvia Venturini Fendi, president of Altaroma, underlined that the organisation first started focusing on sustainable fashion back in 2008. “At the time, my sister Ilaria presented a series of sustainably sourced handbags made in Africa through Altaroma.” Venturini Fendi added that “companies with a long history are slower in becoming sustainable, because they need to break down a system crystallised over the years. It is quicker and easier for start-ups. We are aware of how much of a negative impact fashion is having on the environment, and we are now engaged in a genuine revolution. Above all, consumers are changing: they are consuming less but better, and they are keen to learn about the whole production process. Through the Showcase Roma initiative, 56 emerging designers, no more than four years in business, are embracing these themes.”

""Roman fashion has a glorious history,” said Lorenzo Tagliavanti, president of the Rome Chamber of Commerce, a majority shareholder in Altaroma, adding that “looking at the figures, it is possible, even in so complex a city, to find a way to perpetuate such a major tradition. Rome is home to 20,000 companies, many more than the national average. During the worst of the economic crisis, between 2014 and 2019, Rome’s exports grew by 66%, mostly to the USA, Hong Kong, China and Japan. But fashion needs an overhaul, and must look towards sustainability and technology.”  

Finally, the councillor in charge of economic development at the Lazio regional authority, Paolo Orneli, emphasised how a collaboration between Altaroma and Lazio Innova will directly support 24 out of the 56 young designers taking part in the Showcase. He also announced that, on February 4, the region will open a call for applications by sustainability-focused companies to share in a €10 million funding endowment.Copyright © 2022 ANSA.

"Jan 23, 2020","For her return to the catwalk, Bouchra Jarrar opted for an intimate show. On Wednesday, she invited a handful of friends and journalists to her apartment, welcoming them personally to what felt like a warm and friendly reunion. Founded in 2010, the French designer's namesake brand has not presented a runway show since 2016, when Jarrar joined Lanvin, serving as creative director there until 2017. For her comeback, she wanted to present an ""ideal wardrobe,"" sending out some 15 looks that included something for everyone: men and women, young and old. ""Edition n°1,"" as she entitled her collection for next summer, was made up of desirable basics tailored in beautiful fabrics.

A military coat with silver buttons, a maxi-trench in boiled wool and a long jersey dress cut low at the back shared the catwalk with a leather perfecto worn with creased trousers in midnight blue gabardine and a tuxedo with satin lapels. Not to mention the extra-large rocker t-shirt decorated with an ""Edition n°1"" logo and sequin-embroidered sleeves. All the essentials were there, worn with mix-and-matchable pieces for every mood. Jarrar dressed one model in a flannel banker suit with no shirt and topped off the ensemble off with a fascinator, reimagining the suit jacket on another model as a sort of waiscoat in black wool, shearing off its arms, adding a feathered collar and opening it up at the back. White poplin shirts were worn back to front, while a classic black skirt was paired with a simple white t-shirt and elevated by a handwoven Berber scarf, just like those that the designer's grandmothers used to make – another personal touch at this most intimate of shows. From this calm little street in Paris' 16th arrondissement, it was then time to head out towards the Rive Gauche, to Saint-Germain. Julie de Libran was also receiving her guests at her home/showroom-atelier, inviting them to sit down by the fire, which crackled in a beautifully modern fireplace, nestled between sofas and wooden shelves displaying old cognacs.  
 
This season was also a debut for the designer and former creative director of Sonia Rykiel, as it marked the first official Haute Couture show of the brand that she launched in 2019. According to de Libran, the label's founding concept is the dress, ""the garment that best expresses the woman."" On Wednesday, she was unveiling her second collection, as the first had been presented off-calendar last July.
 
The models arrived from the garden, stepping through a glass door and closing it softly behind them, as though they were returning home from a brisk walk. The first model through the door wore a rhinestone-spangled jacket-dress and was soon followed by others, all wearing dresses, which they complemented with thigh-high boots or booties worn over vivid tights in warm hues of orange, red and yellow.

The dresses were super-short and light, and were made in printed or polka-dotted silk, gold sequin-covered fabric or twilight satin peppered with starry diamonds. They were all simply cut, without sleeves, or with long sleeves that left the models' elbows bare. Some were tight, while others puffed out with cape-like volumes. For the evening, the designer offered up a particularly noteworthy mermaid dress with shimmering scales, as well as a bird dress with flowing plastic fringe. 

The collection also offered dresses that fell as far as the knee or the ankle, in a wide range of materials: from leopard-print to lurex, via silk, chain mail and taffeta. Some tone-on-tone pieces could be deconstructed into a long skirt and top, offering a flexibility and rewearability that fit comfortably with the designer's eco-friendly philosophy. 

""Some dresses are cut in two, so they can be worn separately or interchangeably. I'm hoping to be involved in a more responsible kind of fashion by giving new life to materials. Among other things, I use the ends of fabric rolls collected from brands. Each dress is numbered and made as a limited edition in order to avoid overproduction,"" she explained at the end of the show.

"Jan 23, 2020","LVMH’s Louis Vuitton said on Wednesday it had struck a partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA), a major men’s professional league, as the luxury goods brand ramps up its efforts to make a splash in the United States.Vuitton, best known for its pricey leather handbags and for dressing stars on the red carpet, said in a statement it will design a case to house the NBA trophy, as it has done in other sports such as tennis and soccer, and produce clothing ranges inspired by the league.

The parties did not disclose any financial details, or say how many years the partnership would last.“The NBA as a brand goes beyond sport, some of the players are a brand unto themselves,” said the NBA’s Europe and Middle East managing director Ralph Rivera, at a party to launch the partnership.

The tie-up had no immediate commercial benefit for the NBA but was more about reinforcing its image, Rivera said.

The United States is one of the largest markets for high-end brands after China, and the tie-up marks the brand’s first partnership with a North American sports league, Vuitton.

The agreement comes amid a drive by Vuitton - the world’s biggest luxury label by sales and the main revenue driver at its French parent group - to woo U.S. shoppers as well as young consumers.

Like movie stars, singers or models, sports stars can also wield an influence in the world of fashion, as fans look to emulate their look or follow their every step on social media, and brands are increasingly trying to court shoppers this way.

“Our players are on social media ... and part of what people look at is fashion, it’s what they’re wearing... You’ve got a whole sneaker culture around the game too,” Rivera said.

The NBA-linked, limited edition range of clothing will be designed by Virgil Abloh, who became the first African-American to be named creative chief for menswear at Vuitton last year.
Abloh, a one-time DJ, is known for popularizing streetwear such as hoodies in luxury circles.
Vuitton manufactures the bulk of its handbags in France, but last year opened its third U.S. leather factory, in Texas. U.S. President Donald Trump attended its launch, alongside LVMH’s billionaire boss Bernard Arnault.© Thomson Reuters 2022 All rights reserved."

By 2024, Adidas ""is committed to using only recycled polyester"" across its entire range of shoes, clothing and other items like bags and shin guards.The Bavarian company also said it aimed to churn out 15 to 20 million pairs of shoes in 2020 using recycled plastic waste collected ""from beaches and coastal regions"".

The group already sold more than 11 million such pairs last year -- still just a fraction of the more than 400 million pairs of shoes it makes annually.

Adidas said it was committed to battling the scourge of plastic waste ""to stop the pollution of the world's oceans"".

The firm's first running shoe made entirely from recycled materials, the ""Futurecraft Loop"", is set to hit stores in 2021.

Since 2015, it has collaborated with environmental organisation Parley for the Oceans on a range of products, including football shirts for major clubs such as Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

"Jan 21, 2020","The menswear collections for the Fall/Winter 2020-21 recently presented in London, Florence, Milan and Paris all clearly bear the mark of our troubled times, showcasing composite looks heavily influenced by the controversies stirring society, from the environment to gender politics. Designers highlighted 10 main trends, creating looks that express men's multiple sensibilities and feelings, hovering between comfort and conventions, the past and the present, virility and femininity. In particular, suits remain a staple of most collections, though they have been given a contemporary, highly hybridised twist.1) Feminine/masculineIt is no longer women who help themselves to men’s clothes, but the reverse. While the #MeToo movement still flourishes and gender diversity is a hot topic, men will be laying bare their feminine side next winter. In addition to skirts, already featured in the past and now cropping up here and there, that feminine symbol par excellence, the bra, has appeared on menswear catwalks, though of course under a different guise. Especially used as a decorative accessory by Stefano Pilati, Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Bethany Williams. In similar fashion, necklaces and other kind of jewellery featured in many collections, like the diamanté headband by Takahiromiyashita The Soloist.2) Thigh-high bootsAnother classic women’s item, thigh-high boots, are a success with men, worn in oversize models, angler-style or in a modern-day seven-league version at Vetements, Telfar and Martine Rose. They are a tight, corkscrew-like fit at Random Identities (Stefano Pilati), or look like elongated cowboy boots at Palomo Spain or even like large, high-rise plastic Moon Boots at White Mountaineering. Thigh-high boots may not be for everyone, but one thing is certain: men will be fine in boots next winter, with trousers tucked into them, as seen on all the catwalks.3) Bare legs Is it a consequence of global warming, a reflection of over-consumption or mere commercial pragmatism? Winter collections are getting more and more summery, and men are increasingly going bare. Never before, during the fashion week marathon, was underwear under the spotlight in quite this way. Looks made of jackets and underwear/shorts, or featuring overcoats and raincoats over bare legs and shoes, or boots, even more elegant - the socks clearly visible - will be most directional in Fall/Winter 2020-21.4) Leather galore Leather remains a must-have material in men’s wardrobes. It still features in many collections, especially in matching sport jacket/top and trousers, as well as in long overcoats, jumpsuits and that leather essential, the biker jacket. Several designers took the biker trend literally, introducing knee, elbow and shoulder guards too.5) Hybridisation and patchworkMixing and matching genders and materials, already a dominant feature in fashion collections for several years, is more on trend than ever. Classic jackets and trousers come sometimes in two colours sharply split down the middle, sometimes in two materials, the upper part waterproof, the lower wool. There is an abundance of garments that have been disassembled and pieced back together in patchwork fashion. Junya Watanabe overhauled the whole menswear wardrobe, blending down jackets into coats, or a biker jacket into a classic one. With others, like Marni, clothes become torn between two radically contrasting styles.6) LayeringPlaying with different layers and lengths of clothes might become men's new favourite pastime, judging from the attitudes seen on the catwalks. Jackets are worn in double, even triple layers, like at Comme des Garçons. They are often shortened, like some knitwear, to allow a glimpse of a coat, a pullover or a tunic, in turn exposing shirts and more knitwear.7) DungareesWorkwear is still going very strong, especially with aprons and above all dungarees. Dolce & Gabbana, whose latest collection is a hymn to craftsmanship, showed leather dungarees, as did Salvatore Ferragamo. Gucci went for classic denim dungarees, Casablanca for a comfortable fit. In many of them, the top part falls over the front, making it more stylish.8) LeggingsLeggings have made a noticeable entrance into men’s wardrobes, in a snug, sexy spirit. They are worn outside the gym, uncovered and undisguised, as though the gentleman in question had simply slipped on a pair of tights. In some cases, they look like men’s underwear from a bygone age, or like medieval tights. At Rick Owens, they are worn on one leg alone, the other half of the legging left dangling.9) Frilled shirtsFrilled shirts have made a come-back, discreetly inserted into many collections. Colourful ones by Dries Van Noten and Martine Rose, more austere ones by Prada, reinterpreted with frills extending over the shoulder by Louis Vuitton or oversized by AMI.10) GlamourNext winter, menswear will take on a glam touch, with sequins and long gloves de rigueur. Worth mentioning are the pearl-decorated leather gloves by Dior Men, the latex gloves and shimmering rope belts by Ludovic de Saint Sernin, the long woollen gloves by Dries Van Noten, and the sequinned turtleneck sweater by AMI.

"Jan 20, 2020","Sir Paul Smith celebrated his 50th Anniversary on Sunday night in Paris, and the stars came out to fete fashion’s best-loved knight. 
Fellow knight and master actor Sir Ian McKellen came to Paris, as did Anna Wintour (a day early before couture), and another thesp, Bill Nighy, to join Smith for his runway show in Elysée Montmartre, a 19th century dance hall in north Paris. They later celebrated his half-century at supper three doors down the boulevard at Le Trianon.
 
˝Its not the 50th show, more like the 160th,” laughed the 73-year-old Smith backstage after a great runway moment that was a compendium of his remarkable career.
 
It was backed up by a giant video wall showing highlights from the early days, when he looked as skinny as some of his runway models, to the later years when he first introduced womenswear in 1993.
 
Keeping the creative juices flowing, Smith unveiled some great new elongated suits, the jackets finished well down the thigh, buttons located at the hip. They all looked fresh, hip and highly wearable – Sir Paul’s oeuvre all his life.
 
In a co-ed show, he also dressed the ladies in boyfriends’ suits and tuxedos, and the result was all very flattering and self-assured.
 
Smith also sent out some rather serious and perfectly cut undertaker coats finished with ever-so-frayed hems – paired cleverly with polka-dot shirts. Many guys and girls walked in great hardy denim looks, in midnight blue workers style, or with some fab retro spaghetti prints.
 
Quite rightly, Smith won a standing ovation at the finale, briskly walking down the catwalk in a wave of adulation, none with a bigger smile than his wife Pauline.
 
Reflecting on his career, Britain’s most successful independent designer remarked: ˝We are still independent, Yes ! And I am still involved”. 

“I still have a job, which I love with my heart,˝ he chuckled in the backstage post-show. 
˝The collection, of course, has some references from the past. For instance, some of the logos that we used, even in the show staff shirts. Or the spaghetti print, which was something I used in 1995. And the polka-dots which I did, well, since the beginning of my career,˝ he added with a broad smile.
 
˝And why all the blue? Because as you all probably know, travelling around Paris at the moment is pretty difficult. Between the Gilets Jaunes and what’s happening to Macron. Plus, there’s all this trouble in the Middle East, so we thought what about blue - optimistic, happy and strong ending?˝Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 20, 2020","The show tent for the Christian Dior couture show on Monday was a giant sculpture of a woman’s torso lying in the garden of the Rodin Museum, announcing the theme of yet another bold and dramatic show by the houseʼs couturier Maria Grazia Chiuri.The giant setting, named ""The Female Divine,"" was created by American artist Judy Chicago, who also made the backdrop, which read ""What If Women Ruled the World?"" Which, if it happened in the universe of Dior, would mean we would be governed by divinities.
 
Half the cast were dressed as goddesses and the inspiration was the work of probably the single most famous feminist artist in the world. Couture consists of the most rarefied and expensive clothes in fashion, created for a wealthy elite, but the Dior collection unveiled today was all about female empowerment, albeit at its most divine.Chiuriʼs key idea was peplum, ""a dress that hangs on your body and takes care of you."" Peplum has a long history in sophisticated Paris fashion, though few have worked the concept with such refinement as Chiuri.
 
She draped with enormous gusto, cutting the purest of lines, knotting shoulder straps and finishing midriffs with intricate braiding. Made in the noblest of materials – rose gold crepe, ivory silk chiffon, golden houndstooth jacquard, antique gold tulle and, bien sûr, Dior gray chiffon. Each of the cast of 77 accessorized with gold metallic leafy armbands, floral necklaces, snake bracelets or winged sandals. Botticelli beauties all of them.
 
""My idea from the beginning was the divine female. In my view, goddesses are everywhere, in statues and in art. Especially here in Paris, where in the Louvre you have the Victory of Samothrace"" explained Chiuri, who took a long walk down the tent’s body, posing at its midriff before a gang of front-row Vogue editors-in-chief.
 
While for day, Chiuri whipped up sporty toga versions, and a striking series of pants suits, in antique gold diagonal jacquards, finished with sleek shawl collars.
 
Testifying to the power of Dior, the show's more than 800 guests included a regiment of actresses and beauties, including Kristin Scott Thomas, Uma Thurman, Haley Bennett, Natalia Vodianova, Alexa Chung, Jeanne Damas, Amira Casar, Monica Bellucci and Sigourney Weaver.
 
The Italian couturier ranged about the Mediterranean, with hints of Athenian queens, Carthaginian nobility and wealthy Roman aristocrats, as if they had slipped out of a fresco in Pompeii.
 
Climaxing with model Lineisy Montero, the Dominican beauty, emoting in a maroon chiffon goddess column topped by a feather cape worthy of Cleopatra, as the famed Dior couture atelier went into overdrive. Eat your heart out Elizabeth Taylor.
 Above the audience, a series of hangings posed further questions. ""What if God were female? Could men and women ever be equal?""
 
Yet Chiuri, fashion’s most committed feminist, while hailing the great steps achieved by the womenʼs movement in her lifetime, was nonetheless brutally frank about the lack of progress.
 
""We have never had a female president in Italy, nor in France. If you look at all the great Italian newspapers none of them has ever had a woman editor-in-chief. Same thing in England. And when you think about cooking. If a woman does the cooking, it's domestic. If a man cooks its an expression creativity! And I have never met a woman director of a great hospital. Honestly, I don’t think that much has really changed,"" sniffed Maria Grazia.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 20, 2020","When Japanese designer Masayuki Ino was awarded the LVMH Prize in 2018, he chose to encapsulate his fashion in three words: quirkiness, humour and comfort. A philosophy that he executed perfectly on the third day of the Paris Fashion Week Men’s.In Rue du Vertbois, reminiscent of old-time Paris, the show by Ino’s label Doublet welcomed its guests to a make-believe Tokyo restaurant. The shop windows displayed traditional plastic Japanese food models, known as sampuru. After the advertising banners at the entrance, a gourmet corner sold Japanese sweets and plastic steak and chips dishes, “as kawaii [cute] as can be,” whispered the guests. 
  
In the gallery, a series of giant burger and pizza sculptures fashioned out of lard, fictionally on sale at ridiculously high prices, were displayed as trophies - underlining Ino’s humorous approach - just before the entrance to the dining area. As the loudspeakers announced in Japanese and English that the show was about to start, Ino set the models rolling from dressing rooms made to look like kitchens. The models came in all shapes, sizes, colours and ages, oozing attitude, character, comic-strip quirkiness and, above all, a joie de vivre that is Doublet's signature trait.Setting the tone, the first model strolled in sporting a ramen bowl headgear, clad in an Oriental-style jacket-cum-apron, holding a pair of chopsticks. Then came a ginger-haired boy with a quiff and moustache, straight out of the 1980s Los Angeles gay scene, wearing a black denim jacket with oh-so-French, tongue-in-cheek croissant and pain au chocolat prints.Ino seems to most enjoy exaggerating the details and the volume of his creations. His 1980s young girl manga remix was ultra-kitsch with an Eiffel Tower print, finding a new lease of life in streetwear mode. A smiling Japanese woman wearing a sailor-stripe sweater held an oversized leather tote bag made of a series of detachable elements. From kawaii to Hawaii, a boy wore a floral print outfit in another culture-clash moment, something in which Ino seems to excel.

Doublet’s wardrobe strummed plenty of inventive fashion riffs, blending cultures and genres, from a Diana Ross-style disco outfit mixed with Native American and baseball iconography, to a 1980s tie-dye look, and leather jackets with a punk vibe and Day-glo accents. 
 
Ino described his collection as comfortable, as the highly wearable, trompe-l’œil overcoat in wrinkled leather made to look like a packaging carton showed.
 
The Japanese designer took his bow at the end of the show, holding a cooking pot and clad in a chef's apron.

"Jan 20, 2020","Never has men's fashion been explored so thoroughly in all its different facets as at this January's Paris Fashion Week Men's for Fall/Winter 2020-21. Over the last few seasons, menswear has been trying to find its place, often oscillating between the traditional men's wardrobe and a streetwear attitude. For next winter, it seems to be heading towards a sort of in-between, settling on a wardrobe which is not always well-defined, but open to any number of possibilities, as shown by a range of designers on Saturday and Sunday as the French capital's men's fashion week drew to a close. There was an army-jungle vibe at Sacai. The half-khaki, half-leopard-print outfits sped down the runway to the rhythm of disco hits. The collection was dominated by all-over looks in terms of colourways, prints and materials, and sought to reimagine suits and jackets. 

Tailored jacket-and-trouser ensembles made out of sky-blue silk headscarves were topped off with a long, matching scarf, which hung lightly over the model's chest like a tie. For those looking for a sportier backpacker style, there were also puffy trousers paired with padded jackets, all in a khaki fabric decorated with the same bandana patterns as the shirts and scarves – the leitmotif of the collection. The girls, who were wearing the Pre-Fall collection for 2020, sported big leather biker boots with thick lug soles, while the boys slipped on lace-up mountaineering shoes or leopard-print boots. Both genders wore the same necklaces, made of multiple signet rings linked together.

There were the usual hybrid clothes so dear to Japanese designer Chitose Abe, but they were constructed more subtly, more discreetly, with fabric inserts and appliqués on certain pieces. The sides of a white sweater were harmoniously blended into a black jumper in bouclée wool, while a fringed mini-poncho was integrated into a hand-knitted open jersey.At Dunhill's show, guests were plunged into the depths of a foggy London night, as shadows danced on the walls in the pale glow of a lantern reflecting off wet tarmac. The silhouettes were slender and sombre, with a colour palette dominated by black, grey and navy blue, and shot through with flashes of red. 

Certain pieces caught the light, particularly the satin jackets, the perfectos, the shiny leather pants and the petrol-blue trousers in eel skin. The whole wardrobe was very British, offering a contemporary take on couture, run through with a romantic vein and the odd reference to the 80s. 
 
The Dunhill man wore mocassins with showy golden logo buckles and no socks. The models cheekily left their beautiful satin shirts peak out from beneath their jumpers or piled jackets and blousons over suits. Their necks were wrapped in fine scarves, knitted in silk yarn and left to hang down over their shoulders, as though they had knotted their ties on backwards. 

""I wanted to keep a very clean image at the front and play with detail at the back,"" explained creative director Mark Weston, who was signing off on his fifth collection for the Richemont-owned brand. ""The idea was to create a strong attitude, inspired by the Sex Pistols and the Blitz Club, the underground British movement that gathered around the new romantics in 1979 to 80,"" he continued. 

Leather was also one of the key materials at Ludovic de Saint Sernin, where it featured in trousers, trenches and a long fur-lined coat, but also in asymmetrical tops which left models' shoulders bare, and opera gloves. The designer played with contrasts, between black and white, robust and delicate, covered and uncovered, and even masculine and feminine, notably proposing a pearl-encrusted bra for men.
 ""It's another very personal collection, entitled 'coeur brisé' [broken heart], where I have emphasised the duality between fragility and strength with very couture pieces in organza and sexy leather,"" explained the young designer, who is showing for the second time in the French capital this season. Strength could also be seen in the imposing coats knotted at the waist with a sparkling cord.
 
In contrast to these stronger looks, there were soft, flowing knitwear ensembles with trousers and tops, or lavender-hued shirts, as well as transparent organza topcoats and cobweb-like fishnet tops.

As for Acné Studios, the brand caused a stir on Sunday by totally separating their men's and womenswear runway shows, but holding them at the same. Two entrances had been set up, both opening into the same large room, which was bisected by a wall. At the top of the wall an enormous oval mirror tilted from one side to another from time to time, allowing one to see  – albeit with difficulty  – what was happening on the other side.

The idea was to evoke past, future and present, exploring the effect of time on clothes on the women's side, and imagining a wardrobe designed as a conversation with A.I. for the men.

Squeezed into white leggings or sporting faded green vinyl trousers, or ski-pant-like pieces in astronaut nylon, the men looked to be a touch more interesting than the women, in their long tailored dresses in velvet or frayed antique fabrics. Particularly noteworthy were the jackets that featured an original round opening high up at the front.
 
Pigalle, which showed off-calendar, invited the fashion world into its neighbourhood, to Rue Dupérré, in the heart of Pigalle, where it opened a sports ground nestled between two buildings in 2015. Now entirely renovated, it was here that the brand presented its new sporty ""Basketball"" collection on Sunday, the result of a collaboration with Nike, which was made up of sweaters, shorts, jackets and colourful trousers, as well as two models of Converse.

In a neighbouring building, designer Stéphane Ashpool unveiled his new mini-capsule ""Hôtel Pigalle"" with a musical show. Channelling a palette of blues, oranges and yellows, the collection included satin ensembles, pyjama-like suits and versions spangled with sequins, wrap coats with fur collars and a little jacket with long golden-yellow hair.

"Jan 20, 2020","""I'm back for good,"" announced designer Alejandro Gómez Palomo when he returned to the Parisian runways. And such has been the case, although a wind of change is blowing at his brand. Formerly accustomed to showing on the first day of Fashion Week, largely dedicated to emerging talents, Palomo Spain has now moved to join the more established names, hosting a runway show on the morning of the event's last day, Sunday, 19th January. On his road to maturity in Paris, the Cordobés designer has swapped the rococo stylings of the Spanish Embassy, where valuable Goya paintings witnessed his show last summer, for an empty warehouse in Paris' Belleville neighbourhood. The space seemed like a good fit for ""Ecstasy,"" his collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21, which fused the dramatic Mannerism of El Greco with the raves of the ""Ruta del Bakalao,"" the Spanish techno club movement which shook up Valencia in the 80s and 90s. As such, there were plenty of winks to the narcotics that characterised the late 20th-century party movement, both in the collection's fluorescent psychedelic prints and in the little bags of MDMA-lookalike candy handed out to the show's guests.

With the electronic music of 90s dance artist Chimo Bayo in the background, out came a range of looks inspired by a journey that Palomo had made to Toledo, home of El Greco's work. Opening the show were some discreet tailored looks in black, which were followed by some outerwear pieces demonstrating tremendous pattern work and featuring pointed shoulders and cardinal collars. The silhouettes were slim and elongated, like the figures in the works of the Greek painter, and were characterised by the extreme style with which the brand has made its name. Details in black and white Chantilly lace, shirts with ruffles, frills, sensual transparencies, velvet jackets and aristocratically cut gaberdines were all brought together with a more urban style. It's an unprecedented experiment for Palomo Spain, and one that will no doubt expand its commercial reach. Classic tailoring was mixed in an unexpectedly natural manner with bombers, jackets with cut-outs at the shoulders, cargo pants with reflective details and oversized coats. Colourful prints by artist Sébastien Sans-Arcidet appeared on parkas and silk shirts, while fans made of feathers and fine wood were provided by Kausi, and the footwear offering was developed in collaboration with New Rock Shoes, leading to some particularly interesting Western-inspired knee-high boots with openings. Not to mention the three brocade looks with feminine silhouettes and crystal embellishments, which were the result of a recent collaboration with Swarovski. 

An extra dimension was added by the omnipresent religious references. From the moment the guests arrived at the show, they were struck by a strong smell of incense, while the designer's childhood in Andalusia, where Holy Week is equal parts emotion and pop culture, served as the collection's running theme. Beneath the attentive gaze of French singer-songwriter Christine and the Queens, Spanish rapper C.Tangana, American drag queen and burlesque artist Violet Chachki, and Raquel Sánchez Silva, the presenter of Spain's ""Maestros de la Costura"", on which Palomo is also a judge, the show became an electronic Passion of the Christ. It was effectively a reinterpretation of the Way of the Cross, complete with incense burners and scarlet candles, which led its audience towards ecstasy to the solemn rhythm of a Holy Week parade.

"Jan 19, 2020","There is something quite noble about any show by Craig Green, the king of nomadic chic, who made his Paris runway debut on a chilly Sunday morning.Each look on his catwalk is an assemblage of artefacts – found, researched, borrowed or magnified – that come together in unexpected proportions and odd angles in a soaring drama.
 
No menswear show on the European calendar is more anticipated than that of Green, the most original mind in menswear today. Nor has any other designer in men’s fashion won more ecstatic critical acclaim that Green. And this Fall 2020 collection will be no exception.He opened with intergalactic explorers, in all-white or steely gray numbers made of finely finished satiny puffers with flap pockets and protective midriffs, all covered in inflated harnesses and padded headgear – protected, polished and powerful.
 
Green then riffed on many of his signature touches – extended silhouettes, multiple collars and endless drawstrings in various high-tech worker wear fantasies. But he also added a new take with almost molecular multi-plissé body armor. Even the strands of his string singlets were separated and stood to attention.
 
Space Age shamans marched with soft-shell samurai and poetic wanderers in this show, staged in a looming 19th-century salon with verrière ceiling  in the Temple district of Paris.
 
Half way through he went into overdrive with really beautiful giant collage floral prints – green-petaled sunflowers and soft russet thistles.
 
With serial music cut Himmelfahrt by Mark Allen Shepherd seething on the speakers, as if heralding the landing of an extraterrestrial, the cast marched victoriously at the finale. Uber avant garde, and yet easily refinable into wearable fashion-forward clobber. No wonder the show was packed full of major retailers.
 ""Emerging like landmarks within this terrain, a select system of visual codes that hold special significance begins to grow,"" read Green’s program, tempting inclusion in ""Pseuds Corner"" of Private Eye, though this is a mild quibble about a great show.
 
One, which quite rightly, won Green the loudest ovation on the official clap meter of the menswear season in Europe so far.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 19, 2020","A spirit of youthfulness at Lanvin, which staged a fine, optimistic show and collection, freely inspired by the dashing and eccentric cartoon character Corto Maltese. 
Staged in the Neo-Brutalist concrete Centre National de la Danse in the Pantin suburb of Paris, this Lanvin show was faintly spasmodic as the cast came out in oddly spaced gangs and as individuals, the fruit, in part, of staging a runway over three floors.
 
Referencing his youth in Marseilles, the clothes imagined by Lanvin designer Bruno Sialelli  had lots of kicky insouciance, rather like Maltese himself, whose author Hugo Pratt was a graphic novelist who ended up living on a spit of land at the southern tip of Venice.The result was some cartoonish yet quaintly cool ideas. Dude white shirts emblazoned with the profile of the seadog captain and beautiful aqua blue naval scenes.
 
In terms of tailoring, Sialelli  whipped up some navy officer blazers, naval cadet striped shirts and sailors' pants – all easy and boyish. And fun too, like the leather sailor shirt over-dyed with images of Cortoʼs adventures with South Sea Island pirates. Knits came with embroidered sea birds, gulls and albatrosses.
 
Yet while frequently nautical, there was a skateboarder twist throughout, albeit rather bourgeois boarders – with double-face cashmere parkas, and several really dapper baby blue check cotton shirts worn with matching summer cummerbunds. Or, most eye-catchingly, sequined check jerkins, for when a skateboarder wins an Oscar. Many seemed like crazy young men with a sailor father from Cornwall, and a gypsy mother from Seville, just like Corto Maltese.
 
Sialelli's biggest skill is mixing funky street and fine fabrics, seen in his dip-dyed turquoise pants and a wonderful selection of funky boots. Notably rubber boots finished with beveled heels, or great lazy lad sneakers held together with humungous laces.
 
""Its my Peter Pan syndrome, talking about the naivety and expectations of youth. As a child I was obsessed with Corto Maltese, and his beautiful stories and wardrobe. That blended with the punk couture of skateboarders, like Jason Lee and Tony Hawk,"" explained Sialelli  post show. 
Profiting from the presence of female supermodels in Paris for next week’s couture season, this Lanvin catwalk also featured appearances by Gigi Hadid in a damsel-in-distress all-black combo and Bella Hadid, stomping about in a polka-dot halter-neck dress in diaphanous silk.
 
At times, Bruno Sialelli does lack a self-editing button, and one always thinks at his shows that there is much work for a good merchandiser, yet this joyful fashion expression felt very needed, especially in todayʼs angry France, beset by transport strikes and Yellow Vest protesters. Doubly so on a Sunday, when conservative Catholic marchers closed down the center of Paris demanding no state aid for gay people attempting to have children.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 19, 2020","In a tiny workshop in central Paris, Paloma Casile puts finishing touches on eco-friendly lingerie that she hopes will catch on at an international show a few days hence.

Below her chic little shop on the Rue du Jour, the designer pieces together bits of lace, sometimes combined with lurex, taking care to gather up scraps to be used in other models or donated to fashion schools.""I was always careful when it came to cutting, I have worked in factories and seen the waste"" generated by industrial processes, says the 30-year-old who intends to create another line to be made in Morocco.

Casile launched her eponymous line in 2012, with most suppliers in France and a standardised production process to limit losses.All the fittings are identical, ""and they're made from zamak, which requires half the water compared to other metals,"" she notes in reference to an alloy of zinc, aluminium, magnesium and copper.

Casile also limits her range of colours and uses certified Oeko-tex dyes that are free of toxic substances.

Finally, she repairs her wares for up to four years.

""Ok, it keeps the client on board, but it is also with a view towards not seeing them thrown away,"" she explains.

The approach has begun to gain ground in the fashion industry as environmental concerns encourage more and more companies to explore sustainable methods.

Young designers are spearheading the trend, which remains a niche within a sector that was worth an estimated 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in France alone last year.

""As a consumer, I did not find a brand that offered sexy outfits that were completely responsible along the entire production chain,"" explains Margot Dargegen, 25, who founded Nenes Paris with recycled lace a year ago.

""Scraps of fabric and plastic bottles are ground up and turned into fibres that become thread that you can then make the material you want to from,"" she adds.

- Chains sign up -

""When we started out, finding eco-friendly materials was harder, but we see now that things are starting to move,"" says Mathilde de Sacy, 28, who created the Olly brand with a friend three years ago.

""We use certified material, organic GOTS cotton, lace made with recycled fibres and Oeko-Tex 100 dyes. We also wanted the work to be done in Europe to ensure proper working conditions,"" she adds.

""Consumers pay more and more attention to such things,"" notes Cecile Vivier-Guerin, marketing director for a lingerie show in Paris.

In particular, suppliers are offering wider ranges of fabrics that respect the environment, she said.

They include classic recycled cotton, or satin, or bra shells made from coffee fibre.

A Swiss company offers a line of lingerie that is completely biodegradable.

In a sector that has stagnated in recent years, ""it encourages consumers to buy better quality products that require less transport and add value,"" Vivier-Guerin said.

""It's a significant stimulus,"" she noted.

National brands such as Etam have taken note, and now offer collections made from recycled lace as well.

""Everyone understands that it is an important factor consumers look for,"" says Gildas Minvielle, head of the Economic Observatory at the French Fashion Institute.

That said, ""100 percent ecological is hard to attain,"" admitted Casile, who emphasises that brands interested in the idea must go beyond the purely marketing aspect.Copyright © 2022 AFP.

"Jan 18, 2020","Hermès called its latest menswear collection ""Radical,"" which it was, though subtly so with a capital ""S."" The houseʼs hyper experienced menswear designer Véronique Nichanian stuck pretty closely to the brand DNA of gentlemanly modern understatement, but her ability chose the faultless details that made this a truly special collection.Her cleverest trick was adding a revealing strip of interior fabric – suede, calfskin, nylon or oaky leather – to the inside of funnel-neck coats, trenches and jackets so that they floated ever so slightly. In a lesser hand they would have been awkward, but Nichanian made them look very cool, classy and new.
 
The designer also daringly cut pants tapered at the ankle bone, and nipped them in further with tiny horizontal straps. A clever ploy seen in the trousers of a chalk-stripe suit in water-repellent cashmere, as well as in a pair of deerskin pants.Plus, her sense of understatement at the finale – with its Entente Cordiale Savile Row-meets-Saint Germain double-breasted suits, again finished with the interior strip – was impressive.
 
""A chromatic field in chiaroscuro,"" said Nichanian of her artfully understated palette of ecru, stone, peat, turf and sepia.
 
Quite rightly, she was showered with applause at the finale, from an audience perched on a remarkable array of modernist chairs, part of the archives of a peculiar French institution – the Mobilier National. A giant building in the 13th arrondissement, used to stock quality furniture for the offices of cabinet ministers and embassies.
 
It being France, there was even a trade union protest right outside the front gates. Members of Confédération Générale du Travail, or CGT, the country’s formerly Communist union. Fortunately, they were in a jollier mood than the Yellow Vest protesters, who were busy burning cars at the same moment near Place de la Bastille.
 
 Waving large red flags, the CGT sang a song about protecting the Mobilier National. ""We have nothing against Hermès, but we will defend this organization from outrage,"" explained one of the trade unionists as they handed out leaflets written in both French and English.
 
Inside, the guests, which included American football star, Dallas Cowboys receiver Brice Butler, were offered champagne and Chassagne Montrachet, as well as nibbles of puff balls of foie gras on tiny chips. Underlining the eternal contradiction that is Paris, capital of luxury and the last city in a Western democracy where fervent believers in Communist ideals still fight on.That aside, within the narrower confines of fashion, this collection was a perfectly judged statement on gentlemanly style by a designer in excellent form.
 
Over the past decade, the Hermès company stock has arguably been the greatest success story of any publicly traded luxury brand. Its market capitalization at one stage touched nearly ten times its annual sales, a truly astounding vote of confidence in a company and its future.
 
And a decent chunk of that brand respect is due to Nichanian, who consistently manages the tricky balancing act of creating posh and hyper plausible clothes, while carefully advancing the codes each season.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2020","Following its turn in Provence last June, Jacquemus came back to Paris with a bang on Saturday, hosting its coed runway show for Fall/Winter 2020-21. For the occasion, which also marked the label's eponymous designer's 30th birthday, almost 1,000 people were invited to the Paris La Défense Arena.
 In the cold afternoon air, a sprawling crowd waited at the foot of La Défense's skyscrapers, as a ruthless security team called out instructions like, ""I need a straight line!"" or ""I want you to line up two by two!""
 
After a long wait, the audience was allowed into a space that was as dark as it was vast. Once they had taken their seats among the never-ending rows of them that surrounded a large stage, barely illuminated by a halo of light, there was more waiting to be done, as the show began almost an hour late.Suddenly the lights flashed on and the voice of Simon Porte Jacquemus echoed out over the audience. With his legendary simplicity, the designer presented his collection in a few words: ""I was seven when I cut out a dress for my mother from a linen curtain. Here is the Year 1997 collection."" In other words, this collection was going back to where it all began: the dress that started everything.

Led by Laetitia Casta, making her big comeback after a ten-year break from the catwalk, the models strutted out onto the stage and made their way across it, walking from one end to another in a continuous ballet and sporting a series of linen looks, as well as light beige pieces in the shades of ecru and grège that are so characteristic of the summery fabric. The colour palette also incorporated dusty hues of sage green and Gauloise blue.
 
From the moment the first looks took to the stage with all their fresh breeziness, it became obvious that this wardrobe was somewhat out of step with the seasons, consisting of sexy, summery pieces that left models' shoulders, midriffs and legs bare. With linen firmly in the starring role, Jacquemus had fun tailoring comfortable suits, enticing mini shorts, shirts that were split at the shoulders, and flowing trousers. Not to mention his dresses and trousers with cut-outs.
 The women were perched on high-heeled sandals or thigh-high linen boots open at the heel, and wrapped in generous low-cut dresses or calf-length skirts with slits up the back. In place of tube tops and bras, they wore mini cardigans held closed by a single button. 

And the men were just as risqué. Their unbuttoned white shirts opened over their chests, while the half-zipped flies of their jeans revealed elegant granddad-style underwear, a look that could also be seen on some women. When they weren't half-open, trousers still let the models' underwear peak out subtly at the waistline. 

The overall attitude was one of nonchalant elegance, with some pieces featuring a sun-bleached dégradé effect. Jumpers, either in cosy mohair or transformed into zipped polos, further emphasised this relaxed atmosphere.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2020","Following the departure of Demna Gvasalia, announced in September of last year, Vetements has started writing a new chapter for itself. Having lost its iconic designer, the high-end ready-to-wear street brand, which has been shaking up the fashion world over the last few years, wanted to give the impression that it has been assimilated by the fashion system this season, hosting a celebrity runway. Except that these stars soon revealed themselves to be lookalikes, from top model Kate Moss in a lurex mini dress to rapper Snoop Dogg, via Uma Thurman à la Pulp Fiction. To make it all a bit more believable, the show took place in total darkness. In keeping with its underground spirit, the label created buzz for its show by sending out mysterious mini torches instead of invitations. In fact, the necessary information about the show could only be found by switching on the torch, written in its beam of light. 

On the night itself, the brand's guests found themselves huddled at the end of a dilapidated passageway in Paris' 11th arrondissement, waiting at the entrance to a dark garage. Upon entering, the word ""Vetement"" could be seen freshly painted on the wall in large capital letters, faintly illuminated by a dim light. The audience was ushered into a pitch-black room and placed in their seats, as smartphone screens flickered here and there in the darkness. Before the start of the show, which began about an hour late, a woman's voice gave a ""security announcement,"" which consisted of telling the spectators to turn on the light of their own telephones to be able to watch the runway.

The show flew by, with more than 80 looks modelled by a cast that had been carefully selected to represent the brand's multiple facets. And then, at the end of it all, the spell was broken. The lights came on, completely dispelling the mystery. The models were not, in fact, the celebrities they appeared to be, and Vetements could be seen in a whole new light.

The enormous collection brought together and reinterpreted some of the brand's most successful pieces, including pumps integrated into tights, vintage floral dresses, thigh-high boots, maxi skirts and hoodies. But everything seemed to be more well mannered, or watered down, deprived of the outlandish volumes and quirky twists that the label has become known for. 
Some pieces even seemed classic – perhaps another provocation – with little woollen coats, suits, leather trenches and maxi puffer jackets all displaying perfectly reasonable proportions.

Everything hung on the details and a few star pieces, many of which could be found among the accessories, which are no doubt destined for success. Highlights included the maxi wader-style thigh-high boots for men, as well as another flaming pair, with feet that seemed to be catching fire. The jeans with the word ""censored"" stamped over the fly will surely find their audience too, as will the leather handbags that did a very convincing job of imitating brown paper bags.

"Jan 18, 2020","While the gender neutral trend has been in full swing in the world of fashion for a few years now, we have also been seeing a parallel movement whereby an increasing number of brands are showing their men's and womenswear collections together, leading to some clear similarities developing between the two wardrobes. On top of this, there has been a notable convergence between the two genders. Women are adopting a more resolutely masculine style, while men are tending to soften their silhouette. One might well wonder where exactly the frontier stands between the two these days. At this season's Paris Fashion Week Men's, a number of maisons have given their response to this question, including Juun.J and Officine Générale, who showed their collections on Friday. 

At Juun.J, both men and women wore culottes. For this winter collection, the Korean brand, a long-time promoter of gender-neutral fashion, decided to send mostly women down the runway, so as to emphasise powerful silhouettes through its designer's typical oversized volumes.This predominantly black wardrobe, which featured leather as its star material, is targeted indiscriminately at both men and women, offering imposing full leather jumpsuits, giant perfectos, large 1980s jackets and baggy leather trousers, as well as balaclavas that covered almost all of the models' faces, making nigh on impossible to guess the sex of the wearer. 
 
One difference might serve as a clue: the high-heeled boots worn by the women. Everything else, the whole motorbiking outfit, was worn by both sexes: the maxi denim shirts, the tight pants with knee guards, the leather gloves and multi-pocketed gilets, some of which were fused into long cashmere coats.
 
""I love leather. For this collection, I exclusively used synthetic eco-leather that respects the environment. I was surprised by the multiple possibilities offered by this material,"" said designer Jung Wook Jun backstage, having sent out eco-leather pieces that imitated vintage leather and crocodile skin. This blurring of lines between the genders was also explored in the most formal part of the Juun.J runway show, in which women paired suit-and-tie combos with dark maxi coats, some donning trenches and large square-shouldered jackets.

At Officine Générale, the girls also shared a number of pieces with the boys, looking like they'd pinched them right out of Monsieur's wardrobe. Cases in point were the cosy white jumpers, long fringed scarfs, jackets, checked shirts and corduroy outfits worn by a number of the female models. 

That said, since launching his womenswear line in 2017, designer Pierre Mahéo has always borrowed a range of menswear looks in order to dress the Officine Générale woman. And he's got plenty to chose from, as his skill in constructing a complete and well-rounded menswear collection is second to none, leading to an ideal wardrobe that caters to every need.

This season, his suits, in particular, were very varied. There was the elegant and comfortable model with its creased trousers and two-button jacket, the vintage carrot-coloured velvet number with wide sides, and the relaxed cotton look with roll-up trousers. Not to mention the banker suit and the black 60s-style number with slimline trousers.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2020","Leave it to Olivier Saillard and J.M. Weston to fête the debut of their new vintage project – a neat example of the circular economy – with a moment of Parisian performance art. 
With fashion encyclopedist Saillard wielding an MC microphone, as a cast of fine-boned youths in tuxes, cricket gear and sack suits paraded around Weston’s store at 243 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré – all wearing freshly repaired vintage Westons. The boutique was temporarily redone as a faux pop-up with raw plywood walls, counter and runway, a three-week revamp for the launch of this concept, named Weston Vintage.
 
With typical Parisian humor, Saillard invented a fashionista nickname for each pair. A pair of oversized rainbow-colored moccasins were entitled Virginia Bloh, maroon preppy golf shoes named Ralph Simons, while there were also titles like Helmut Klein, Calvin Lang, Roger Gabbana and Bartin Malanciaga.""It’s the circular economy in a very real way. Repairing and overhauling some great old shoes with marvelous patina, though done with a sense of humor,"" explained Saillard, the brandʼs creative director.
 
After the house realized that at any given moment there were roughly 1,000 pairs of used Westons on offer on the Internet, it decided to act.
 
""Nearly all of our clients bring their Westons to be reshod at least once in their life. So, this is one way of introducing our brand to a younger client, and at a more modest entry price point,"" said CEO Thierry Oriez.
 
The possible turnover of this new division is of course limited to the number of pairs clients are prepared to sell back to the house. Oriez confessed that out of the 900 pairs offered by clients, the house ended up accepting and recycling only 300.
 
However, so far, demand has been impressive. Weston sold a dozen pairs in the store in the 24 hours before Saillard performed. The immediate goal is to introduce this concept at Weston’s two Paris boutiques and at its flagship in Tokyo.

"Jan 18, 2020","Those looking for a playful, yet twisted vision of menswear, with a tincture of transgression and a soupçon of the surreal, need look no further than Loewe, whose latest collection was the very definition of playful youth.The show was staged on a sunny Saturday morning in Anderson’s preferred local for Loewe, the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, though once again the tightly-edited audience took an unlikely side exit into the show space, located in the bowels of this labyrinth of architectural modernism.
 
Shades of a New England pier in the set, made of a lacquered black boardwalk and pylons, sunk into a concrete sea.Up on the catwalk, many young men in dresses that looked like aprons – in battered gold, parakeet green, copper or bitter orange – that had mysteriously morphed into ballgowns. Others waked in faux crochet columns, or A-line coat-dresses.
 
""I had looked at 50s ball gowns and I thought of when you were a child, what would that look like when you tried something on in front of a mirror. Its like 2D to 3D,"" smiled Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson.
 
Everything was anchored by very cool and very commercial black patent leather boots finished with ankle chains, or a selection of clever dusted gold ballet slippers.
 
Anderson has been showing elephant bags and purses at Loewe for six years, though this season he blew them up with hefty proportions, turning them into half-meter-square leather or snakeskin  pachyderms, so dusted in Indian medals they were worthy of Maha Shivaratri.
 
""I was looking at Christopher Dresser, who obviously travelled the world, like Asia and Nepal, and brought things back and then interpreted them and made them for the mass,"" expounded Jonathan.
 
Anderson’s most iconic garments for Loewe are arguably his shirts, seen for Fall 2020 with raw organza bibs and cuffs, or composed in baby blue and embroidered with two giant black birds – the latest generation of Irish Wild Geese. These were mostly worn with mysterious pants with roll-ups well up the calf, and completed with soft S&M leather chain belts. Ideal for naughtier moments.
 Under Anderson’s guidance, Loewe has flourished from a venerable yet dusty Spanish label to one of fashion’s hippest marques. The Ulster-born designer, whose parents sat proudly in the front-row, will have tripled Loewe’s annual turnover to well over half a billion euros during his six years in charge.
 
Notably, the actual fabrics in this collection were far more expensive – like double-face cashmere. Even if the the silhouette was more risqué.
 
""The idea is about when you wear clothes, they can transform your character into whatever you want to be. So this was boyish, optimistic, playful and weirdly like super heroes somehow. Pretty boy with sexual tension, like they may be into something,"" he laughed.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 18, 2020","Kim Jones looked back to his youth in London for inspiration for the latest Dior menswear collection, a bold and courageous homage to the late great Judy Blame. And the result was a stellar show that hit all the right notes in terms of attitude, tailoring, silhouette and style. 
Showing remarkable assurance, Jones distilled key elements of Blame, the most famed of all UK punk stylists, into practically every look. Winning an enormous wave of applause, cheering and feet thumping as he took his bow inside a giant Dior dove gray tent at Place de la Concorde. Before a front row that included Robert Pattinson, Cara Delevingne, Victoria, David and Brooklyn Beckham, and his boss, the 100-billion-euro entrepreneur Bernard Arnault.
 
Blame was known for incorporating the detritus of the urban jungle into his fashion imagery, and this show played imaginatively with all his ideas. Like his signature ruched-up waist and drooping lapels, which Kim worked perfectly into super-tony cashmere coats. Or Blame’s penchant for wacky medallions, in his case bottle tops, can openers, pearly buttons or safety pins, but for Dior – great spiky medals from a member of Kim Jones' cohort, jewelry star Yoon Ahn, as well as coins featuring Judy as a monarch or Blame’s fetish pearls.However, though punk-inspired, the clothes had a definite majesty. Divinely hung tuxedos with contrasting collars, surgically cut leather blousons that fitted like a glove or the magnificent opening night silk moiré evening coat finished with a huge fabric rose.
 
All the Dior team were on inspired form, notably milliner Stephen Jones, who composed a marvelous series of Andy Capp flat-caps and berets with zip edges, Judy coins, Pearly King buttons and even the famous arrow shape, which Judy used as a Mohican hairstyle.
 
Blame’s collaboration at Jones' old house, Louis Vuitton, led to a worn denim bag with LV trinkets in silver and gold which is now a collectors item. This Friday at Dior,there was instead a Toile de Judy dancing gal print, as well as a newspaper collage made of Monsieur’s original press releases and elements of Judy’s sketchbooks done in partnership with the Judy Blame Foundation.Jones also developed heat-print shirts and opera gloves in the Oblique pattern, seen with gentlemanly cashmere coats, and finished with fabric-covered buttons, just like the Bar Jacket. A very Christian Blame moment.
 
After-hours club met outrageously expensive in a splendid blazer of brushed vicuña, taken from the bellies of vicuña that live on the shores of Lake Titicaca, quite literally. Or in a mink trench coat, remarkably shaved to have a trompe-l'oeil effect.
 
Jones was encouraged to embark on such a personal quest by Diorʼs CEO Pietro Beccari, who knew of Jones' friendship with Blame.
 
""When Judy passed, Pietro texted me his condolences as my friend had died. So, then, later he was like, 'why don’t you do something, whenever everyone is able to deal with it?' And I thought we are now,"" explained the designer.
 
Jones first met Blame ""when I was very young in The Fridge in Brixton,"" back when he was 18. ""He was quite terrifying! But I plucked up the courage to go and talk to him, and voilà!""
 
The Dior creator climaxed with an opera coat, rain-splattered with three types of rhinestones and sequins to better diffuse the light, a look that referenced a Marc Bohan idea from 1969. The ultimate in menswear couture with 964 hours of hand embroidery.
 Jones is now so self-assured about his position that he even showed editors a 1991 image of Judy working with John Galliano, the former women’s designer of Dior, whose career went into a tailspin after a drunken incident in 2011.
 
""This is Judy styling Galliano, with one of his newspaper prints looks, with a note from Galliano saying how much he loved it. Coz, you know, they were really good friends. So, that’s a link to this house as well,"" noted Jones.
 
Post show, there was a palpable sense of elation among the studio team, scores of makeup artists and models that one only gets after a great show. For this was unquestionably a massive triumph.
 
In a word, when it comes to international men’s fashion, Kim Jones is the daddy now. Judy would have been very proud.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 17, 2020","On the third day of Paris Men’s Fashion Week, guests fatigued from the ongoing strikes in the French capital gathered to witness Yohji Yamamoto’s latest runway show. This season, the Japanese designer presented a collection that brought to mind a young, rebellious spirit through his use of deconstruction and layering along with refined tailoring.As the show opened, a female vocalist sang a with an air of melancholy about rising suicides amongst Japanese youth and a model swathed in a voluminous coat appeared on the runway. This was followed by looks including a trench coat which had been deconstructed and sewn back together; a coat that fused a tailored jacket with two types of checked tweed, notably featuring an asymmetric hem with fringing on one side. 
 
The following ensembles showcased a military style featuring deconstructed classic materials and a long-line silhouette. Then, gradually, more punk-inspired elements started to appear on the runway including red checked tartan, frayed-thread appliqués, and multiple layers of chains worn about the neck. Footwear included lace-up boots and sneakers, while other stand-outs included a thick wool sweater with a frayed hem worn over the top of a suit.The invitation to the show featured photos of women in the resistance during the Second World War. Many models also walked the runway in a resistance-style beret. A tie featured Japanese characters meaning “domestic” while an embroidered message along a hem read “last laugh."" The slogan “Taxedo Park” was emblazoned on the back of a coat and a no-smoking sign added to the feeling of youthful playfulness.
 
The most striking slogan read “Naughty Yohji,” on the back of a black coat made from three-dimensional textiles. The show was brimming with emotion and a complex, rebellious spirit, conceived by a master tailor who has long been at the forefront of the “resistance” in fashion.

"Jan 17, 2020","During Paris Men’s Fashion Week, which is currently taking place in the French capital, Gap held a party at its store on rue Tronchet to announce its new partnership with US-based brand Telfar. The unclassifiable and eclectic brand was created by African-American designer Clemens Telfar in 2005 and recently took part in Italian trade show Pitti Uomo in Florence and created a feast-like show.Having previously navigated outside of the fashion establishment, cultivating an underground and inclusive spirit, Telfar has now joined forces with one of the largest distributors of both American and global fashion. The two brands have found that they share a common ground and say that they both uphold “a philosophy of accessibility, democratisation, and a wardrobe made up of universal and affordable basics.”
 
It comes as no surprise that Clemens Telfar is obsessed with Gap which built its foundations on the idea of a “normal” look. The Gap archetype is “literally everyone: [regardless of] origin, style, rich, or poor,” said Telfar. “I want to take this idea in 2020 and get my clothes out of fashion capitals and and make them available across the whole world. Gap makes that possible.”So far, the brands have not shared any images of the collaboration save for a logo and plan to unveil more about the collection in the coming months. The ambition of the collaboration is to “co-create products which inspire freedom of expression and bring about positive change.”
 
Gap has previously worked with a number of cutting-edge brands to enable them to greatly expand their horizons and allied itself with AMI in 2017. Gap also reimagined its signature hoodie with brands including Balmain, DSquared2, and MSGM when it collaborated with GQ Magazine in 2018. “Collaborations are important for Gap and, by collaborating with Telfar, we hope to create a collection that is a reflection of contemporary American fashion,” said John Caruso, head of adult design at Gap. 
 
Gap, which is in the middle of a restructuring, currently operates 1,600 exclusive brand outlets around the world and parting ways with the Old Navy chain, which currently belongs to the same group. The brand’s previous CEO Art Peck also left the brand last November and Gap is in the process of slimming down and closing 230 stores, including eight of its 30 stores in France. In the third quarter of the 2020 financial year, the group saw its sales fall by 2.2% to total $4 billion.

"Jan 17, 2020","Botter’s show at the Paris Fashion Week Men’s was eagerly awaited, and it did not disappoint. On Thursday night, Dutch designers Lisi Herrebrugh and Rushemy Botter, winners of the Grand Prix at the Hyères Festival in 2018 and also the creative directors of Nina Ricci, received a thundering ovation at the end of their debut Parisian catwalk show, for their well-balanced collection blending directional couture with a more casual tone. It was above all a prolific collection, a genuine declaration of their love for fashion.
 The word ‘Love’ in bright red letters is the collection's main thread, popping up in most of the looks: a tiny printed motif on a pleated white shirt, small patches embroidered on a cable-knit sweater, or boldly in the middle of a mustard-coloured pullover. Another pullover claims that ‘There is no crying in fashion’.
 
Botter’s fashion is joyous and beautiful. Above all, it is accessible to everyone, as the Fall/Winter 2020-21 wardrobe created by the two designers seems to be telling us. With a pinch of imagination and plenty of inventiveness, they have created a democratic kind of couture, clothes with which everyone can look extremely elegant, even without too many resources or means, as the designer duo explained backstage, underlining that all their fabrics are salvaged or recycled.A film of transparent plastic floats like a lightweight scarf, tied around the neck or rolled around the head in hat-headscarf fashion. A larger, stiffer plastic film transforms into a top, with the same pattern of a cable-knit sweater. The plastic pin heads used to pin the clothes’ price tags morph into decorative feathers, becoming a forest of spikes on original, brightly coloured hats, or creating a suggestion of volume on a pair of dark trousers or a micro-check suit, giving them a crazy feel.The collection is brimming with details, evidence of the designers’ couture research, giving a surprise twist to each item. Like the thin blue strips, seemingly cut from a plastic garbage bag, that act as twirling appliqué stripes on a white shirt. Another example are the wisps of cotton, like a puffer jacket’s padding, with which the designers create fluffy flower-like patches on an oversize tweed jacket. Elsewhere, the top section of a jacket is slit open, folding outwards to expose the lining.
 
A special mention goes to the handbags shaped like birthday-party air balloons. Silvery or multi-coloured, decorated with trinkets and messages like ‘good luck’ and ‘happy birthday’, they were created in collaboration with US artist Adam Parker Smith. They will surely be a big success.
 
The two designers, partners in work and in life and linked by their shared Caribbean roots, met in the Netherlands and are based in Antwerp, Belgium, where they founded the Botter menswear label in 2017. Rushemy Botter, 34, lived until the age of 12 on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, while the mother of Lisi Herrebrugh, 30, hails from the Dominican Republic. Botter is distributed via some 40 multibrand retailers, chiefly in the USA and in Belgium.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 17, 2020","Issey Miyake's guests were plunged into a jazzy, New York atmosphere at his show at Paris Fashion Week Men's on Thursday. As in previous seasons, the Japanese brand had called in choreographer Daniel Ezralow to help present this Fall/Winter 2020-21 collection for Homme Plissé, the line of timeless, mostly pleated basics by the house's founder, Issey Miyake himself, who has been showing his collections during the French capital's men's fashion week since June 2019.The result was a joyful and inclusive show, where smiling models warmly shook audience members' hands, as they presented a simultaneously energetic and airy collection. The first of them to take to the stage walked cheerfully around in super-comfortable jackets and trousers, carrying enormous discs under their arms and bursting with vibrant, shimmering colours. The collection's bold palette was particularly enchanting.

A jazz quintet of trumpeters and saxophonists dressed in outfits with colourful prints and monochrome shoes in shades of yellow, purple, green and sky blue, was playing Gershwin's famous Rhapsody in Blue. When the solos began, the stage was invaded by models wrapped in voluminous parkas and waterproofs featuring large abstract motifs.As the musicians played one jazz classic after another, from Herbie Hancock's Watermelon Man to Paul Desmond's Take Five, via Sing Sing Sing, as played by Benny Goodman in 1937, the luminous hoops that surrounded the stage were continuously moved around in a perpetual reconfiguration of the space which accompanied the rhythm of each new piece being played.

Eight double bass players appeared wearing knitted outfits composed of large sleeveless gilets, jackets and mosaic pants or beige jumpsuits. Then an acrobat in short, loose trousers, swept onto the stage, spinning at the centre of a giant ring and adding to the feeling of a merry-go-round or a never-ending round, where living clothes seemed to stretch, bounce and float around the room. Cubist-style musical instruments decorated the backs of colourful waterproofs in shades of royal blue, golden yellow, vermilion and emerald, giving the impression of moving paintings. Three models in flowing trenches sneaked a drummer and all of his drums into the centre of the stage.

He was quickly joined by the remaining musicians, who all launched into the grand finale. Models wearing suits and tail coats in an undulating pleated fabric, along with bow ties and a range of crooner-worthy hats, danced around in a frenzied ball. And then, with incredible grace, they invited audience members to join them, even if very few were brave enough to take them up on the offer.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 16, 2020","Fashion loves nothing more than a catwalk debut, and a major one this season was the first runway show by Federico Curradi for the house of Rochas.The show also marked the runway debut of Rochas menswear after a multi-year hiatus. Curradi joins a long list of critically acclaimed designers who have worked for Rochas, including Olivier Theyskens, Marco Zaninni and Alessandro DellʼAqua, the creative director of womenswear who quit the house in December of last year. Curradiʼs previous two collections for Rochas were unveiled in presentations. This event felt more like the acid test.
 
Curradi, an earthy son of the Tuscan soil, has an innate ability to develop clothes that make a guy feel self-assured. You sensed that from the confident manner in which his careful casting of romantic-looking models marched.There was nothing revolutionary about this collection, nor should there have been. Founded in 1925 by Marcel Rochas, the label has been known for its strict  architectural cut and restrained colors. Just like this collection, blessed with impeccably cut worsted wool redingotes, flowing jute dusters and a couple of sensational Crombie’s – exactly in length favored by the founder of this house. All the way to the poet-maudit chic of the final modern fracks and tails.
 
Everything showered with tiny golden pins, leaves, necklaces and miniature chains. Seen on shoulders, cuffs and on many of a great series raffish hats – from gaucho to balladeer.
 
Staged almost casually in the beautiful Louis XV-style Paris mansion of the Hôtel de Béhague, a famed salon of the Belle Époque where Paul Valery, Marcel Proust and Auguste Rodin congregated in the lime green and gold neo-rococo Salon d'Or.˝Elegant, nocturnal and just a little decadent,˝ opined the Florence-based Curradi after his accomplished debut.
 
Formerly owned by Procter & Gamble, Rochas was acquired by Interparfums in 2015. And the newer owners are obviously ambitious to make ground in menswear. This show felt like an important step in that direction.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 16, 2020","Rarely has the singular vision of designer Rick Owens been quite so  particular. The Californian-born creator returned to his preferred Paris location on Thursday to unveil his latest menswear collection, as models towered above the audience inside the Palais de Tokyo. 
Striding by like off-beat superheroes in five-inch heel Perspex heels, the cast, many of them two-meters tall anyway, grimaced unflinchingly. Dry iced covering the catwalk, industrial sounds snorting out of the speakers. The music was by Master Mike Q, culled from a performance Owens staged in the Pompidou Center in October.
 
Several of Rick’s couture crusaders appeared with humungous pagoda-shoulder coats, some in one-legged and one-armed pinstripe body-stockings, others in hulking blanket coats that the designer said were meant to mimic Le Corbusier’s Modular Man. Even if the collection did also have some instant hit mohair coats, this was way-out-there stuff.Owensʼ preferred hues, at least when you go in his stores, are mat black or worn stone gray. This season he sent out eggshell blue, yellow snakeskin and muddy orange silk. Even more curiously, many of his gray cashmere knits and skinny transparent tops were worn under translucent vinyl coats.
 
˝There is a heavy dose of theatre in this collection,˝ explained the designer in his program notes, with considerable understatement. 
Nearly all his cast had hair extensions worthy of a Kurosawa samurai classic, courtesy of stylist Duffy from Streeters, while many had darkened eye lens adding to the forbidding air. In a word, a dystopian dash from the single most influential designer American designer living today. And another reason by Paris is the world’s most significant fashion capital – both for women and men.

"Jan 16, 2020","Designer Kenzo Takada will launch a new luxury home and lifestyle brand K三 (pronounced K3) at the Maison & Objet trade show in Paris, France, which begins on January 17.Takada’s new brand offers chairs, sofas, tables, rugs, bed linens, home textiles, and accessories. In addition to incorporating technology from traditional Italian brands, K三 has collaborated with luxury bed linen company Sferra and incorporated the traditional technique of Kintsugi into certain products to as an homage to Japanese craftsmanship. The designer blends Japanese and Western aesthetics and interprets them through his own lens. 
 
The brand’s maiden collection is based on and inspired by nature and Sakura (Japanese cherry blossom) as well as the Maiko (apprentice Geisha) with her delicate and refined heart, the brand said. The collection’s final inspiration is the three main concepts of the powerful, monochrome expression of majesty, the Shogun (military ruler) expressed through brilliantly coloured, exclusive prints.Takada launched the brand and holds the role of artistic director along with his long-term managing partner Jonathan Bouchet Manheim, who has worked with him since 2013. The brand’s other team members include Engelbert Honorat and Wanda Jelmini along with other interior designers and craftspeople.

"Jan 16, 2020","Staging the inaugural show in a Fashion Week is never an easy endeavour. Some seasons have been marked by memorable, theatrical openings - thanks to Palomo Spain for example - but the shows that kickstarted the Paris Fashion Week Men’s on Tuesday January 14 weren’t exactly unforgettable.Spearheading the week's first day, Chinese designer Shangguan Zhe staged the show of his label Sankuanz at the Ellian Art Gallery in rue de Turenne. In a less than inspired choice, Zhe went for low lighting that gave a ghostly expression to all the guests. Using smartphones to shed some light on the matter was no use, since the photographers present called for all phones to be off.
 
Parading at breakneck pace, the models flaunted a punkish attitude with plenty of tattoos and piercings, clad in black, leather and Dracula-style suits, with day-glo colours cropping up in many looks. A mere hint in some cases, elsewhere a fluorescent piping on a pair of tracksuit bottoms, or colour-block trousers and boots and even check shirts in lumberjack disco style. “Why not,” whispered the audience. The ensembles made of multiple layers of coats and jackets were a much better proposition, adding a well-realised street/military feel. The punk vibe was then back with a vengeance, with studded belts and black leather jackets tagged like the Berlin Wall. In two of the looks, Sankuanz showcased its latest collaboration with Adidas, black and fluorescent colours again, and some models that will be launched in Shanghai in a few weeks.Rhuigi Villasenor, with his label Rhude, was one of the eagerly awaited names in Paris this season. For his official calendar debut, the Philippines-born and Los Angeles-based designer brought his guests to the iconic Elysée Montmartre venue. Bandannas and baseball hats with references to LA - Villasenor first caught the attention with a t-shirt and bandanna outfit worn by rapper Kendrick Lamar – abounded among the audience.
 
On stage, two drummers cued the entrance of a series of men's and women's looks, a blend of structured couture and sportswear in a palette of earthy, pastel and laminated colours, with plenty of references to US style icons, like letterman jackets with a Thriller-esque twist and chaps trousers, blended with more tailored looks featuring overcoats, dusters and boxy puffer jackets. Rhude's debut collection seemed at times a little disjointed and hard to define, but its experimental cuts and mood augur well for the future. The day's real revelation showed just opposite, at the Lycée Jacques Decour, the venue chosen by US designer Spencer Phipps to present his third Parisian collection. 
 
A booklet entitled ‘Treehugger, tales of forest’, placed on the audience’s benches, set the tone for a collection dedicated to the protectors of Mother Nature and its forests, a highly relevant contemporary theme. 
 
Mustered on the stage, the models chosen by Phipps - in all shapes and sizes, from athletic to slender, from lumberjack to neo-waif - celebrated men in all their diversity, a stance the designer assumed early on in his career. They walked the catwalk judiciously, outfitted as US park rangers, hats firmly on their heads and velvet trousers sporting galactic prints, or as campers with an urban dweller or pilgrim touch, wearing jumpsuits and printed ponchos whose images are the work of photographer Linda Westin. 
 
The collection’s guiding theme was Smokey Bear, the advertising icon first adopted in the 1940s by the U.S. Forest Service to teach kids what to do in case of a forest fire, whose face featured on sweatshirts and pullovers, adding a delicately retro touch to the collection.
 
Spencer Phipps is sensitive to environmental issues and a promoter of sustainable fashion, and took the opportunity to work with his new preferred materials, like pineapple leather, utilised on down jacket yokes, and to launch his new Gold Label, featuring clothes derived from second-hand or inventory clearance items, bolstering his collection’s circularity message.

As he stepped on the stage to greet the audience, Spencer Phipps received the day's, and the fashion week's, first round of applause.

"Jan 16, 2020","""The show must go on,"" seemed to be the motto at Paris Fashion Week Men's on Wednesday. For the second day of menswear runway shows a number of designers had decided to put on a real performance. Following the dazzling tap dancer who put in an appearance at Off-White's morning runway, Valentino enchanted its audience with a simultaneously intense and delicate show accompanied by the vocals of British singer-songwriter FKA Twigs, while Undercover presented its collection with a veritable dance spectacular. 
 As a late afternoon rain began to fall in Paris, Valentino created a poetic moment that seemed to break the usual hectic frenzy of Fashion Week. As the room was plunged into darkness, FKA Twigs took her place on a small stage that had been set up in the middle of the runway. 

Accompanied by a pianist and a cellist, and wearing a long, crystal-encrusted lace gown, she sang the first notes of an almost mystical song that echoed out into the silence, seeming to summon the first models onto the catwalk. The music was a perfect match for the collection designed by Pierpaolo Piccioli for Fall/Winter 2020-21, which softened formal menswear wear with a romantic touch. Impeccably tailored coats, shirts and suits were decorated with giant black and white or multicoloured flowers, appliqués inspired by the work of photographers Inez and Vinoodh. A gigantic long-stemmed red rose ran down the side of a pea coat, appeared on the back of a jacket and even popped up on mini-handbags with shoulder straps. Elsewhere, pink carnations and yellow bellflowers completed the bouquet on military jackets.

The slogans of French artist Mélanie Matranga provided another theme, with words such as ""Need,"" ""Bad Lover,"" ""Good Lover"" and ""You"" appearing on a variety of pieces. They were blown up to enormous proportions and even distorted at times, spelled out in black capital letters on a white jumper or blazer. They were also repeated in white lettering on a black background, or black on black, or took a more unexpected form, being written in sequins or tiny fringed tube beads.""I wanted to bring a new kind of sensitivity to the male identity, mixing a romantic spirit with traditional tailoring. I'm trying to change menswear codes by taking key elements and putting them in a new context,"" said the designer, who teamed up with Onitsuka Tiger for his sneakers this season. 

Piccioli emphasised this new direction with structural innovations, such as large slits which gaped wide under the sleeves of jackets and coats. ""They're drastic efforts to take some of the stiffness away from the suit. I also added slits to the backs of shirts to give them a certain flexibility,"" he explained. 
 
At Undercover, there was another, quite different show. After last June's dark, minimalist collection, Japanese designer Jun Takahashi seemed to be looking to make a big statement, inviting buyers and celebrities, along with the press, to Paris' Cirque d'Hiver for a striking dance show, which at times appeared to be a Shakespearean drama and, at others, a Kurosawa film, the whole collection reflecting a profound Japanese influence. 

The show began with a sort of volcanic fog, which parted to reveal a silhouette moving strangely at the centre of a circular stage. The shape gradually transformed into a kind of gorgon that threatened a passing man: the piece's unfortunate hero, who would ultimately be shot through by a rain of arrows at the end of the show, after a series of vignettes.
 Each mini choreographed scene was broken up by the runway show, in which Takahashi presented explorers in hats or berets, tartan jackets, striped jumpers and knee-length Zouave pants, along with alpine mountaineers trussed up with ropes, bags and cloth pouches, and sporting woolly hats and various layers of clothes, including coats, jackets, puffer jackets, gilets and tunics. Road workers also joined the show, wearing sporty ensembles decked out in reflective bands, all of which made them look like samurais in clothing reinforced by patches of padded or quilted fabric attached to their arms and shoulders.

On top of this, the designer also sent out a range of womenswear looks, having stopped his women's fashion shows in March 2018 after almost 16 years showing during Paris' women's ready-to-wear fashion week. As of June 2018, he has shown his collections during men's fashion week. 

Among the spectators at the Cirque d'Hiver, one could pick out Piccioli. The Italian designer had come to support his Japanese colleague, who signed off on a collaboration with Valentino last season. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2020","It felt like a late 70s happening at Y/Project this season, where the entire audience had to wade through a sea of orange balloons to attend the show. 
Thousands and thousands of balloons, so many that they reached up to the audience members’ waists, as they stumbled over them to find a place to view the models. The cast marching five feet above them on an elevated catwalk inside an obscure school gym behind the Jardin du Luxembourg. And the finale was even more chaotic, as the hundreds of guests struggled out, driving a huge wave of balloons all the way up two flights of stairs to the entrance.
 
That said, this was a great punchy collection by Glenn Martens the creative director of Y/Project, a man noted for his off-beat cutting and courageous take on fashion.From beautifully braided faux chalk-stripe suits, witty angry-tiger-motif woolen scarves and askew plaid trapper pea coats for the boys, to steamy silk corset dresses, deconstructed military trench coats and fantastic racy leotards paired with cowboy chaps for the ladies.
 
The show also heralded a cool new collaboration with Canada Goose, one month after the North American brand opened a major new flagship in Paris on Rue Saint-Honoré.Everything was backed up by some great drumming, carnival music and the continuous popping of balloons.
 
""Working in fashion is tough business of deadlines and almost permanent shows. So I wanted to comment on that stressful madness, and also see the humor in it,"" commented Martens in the packed backstage changing rooms.
 
The mood was one of controlled pandemonium, just like the fashion. Outrageous but clever and commercial too. The gym was packed with buyers, and rightly so, Y/Project connects with cool dressers.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2020","A red velvet curtain, an accordion player, an old theatre at the bottom of Montmartre hill. All the elements were there to celebrate in style the most Parisian of Parisian labels. And it was a highly successful celebration for Alexandre Mattiussi, who opened the Paris Fashion Week Men’s on Tuesday night, at the Le Trianon theatre, with the 9th anniversary show of his label AMI.The models walk through the stalls sporting a chic-nonchalant attitude, accompanied throughout the show by accordion music. Some of the boys are clad in ample white gaberdine cotton trousers, black frilled shirts and white overcoats with generous lapels. Others wear houndstooth-check ensembles or grey wool suits over tone-on-tone turtleneck sweaters, with a red bobble in the buttonhole in lieu of a flower.

A bowler hat and a black and white crochet-knitted scarf add a quirky, poetic feel to some of the looks. The AMI boys love to dress up for a party, wearing their best frilled shirts or a glittering turtleneck sweater over black jeans. They are also keen on lozenge-patterned mohair knitwear, while the AMI girls wear long pencil skirts.AMI’s classic wardrobe features a palette of white, black and grey, with flashes of bright red and emerald green. Some of the boys are wearing a skirt. “The maxi kilt is a tribute to Jean Paul Gaultier, who recently celebrated his 50th anniversary, while the women’s oversize headband is a nod to Thierry Mugler,” said Alexandre Mattiussi backstage.For the last act, all the models gather together on the stage, where the huge red curtain slowly parts to reveal a cardboard scenery depicting a familiar Parisian backdrop, with grey walls, street lights and the city’s signature metro station sign. It is on this imaginary Parisian street, with its small hotel and striped bar awning, that the show ends to rapturous applause.

“I dreamt about this. Nine is my lucky number. I wasn't going to celebrate a 10th anniversary! I love this collection because it's very elegant, and a little theatrical. There’s something very easy in these looks, and at the same time, it's couture,” said Mattiussi, who always manages to subtly express this kind of Parisian style, at once classy and spontaneous.

Needless to say, the Le Trianon theatre, a Belle Epoque favourite, was full to the brim on Tuesday night, from stalls to balconies. Among the front-row celebrities, Ladj Ly, the director of Academy Award-nominated French film ‘Les Misérables’, actors Virginie Ledoyen, Vincent Dedienne, Nicolas Maury and Vincent Elbaz, ballet dancer Hugo Marchand, and singers Christine and the Queens, Camélia Jordana and Cécile Cassel.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2020","A score of mannequins sat in the front row at J W Anderson at Wednesday lunchtime, stockmen with heads covered by cardboard cut outs of the face of Arthur Rimbaud. An homage not just to the French poet but also to David Wojnarowicz, the photographer, artist, AIDS activist and cult Lower East Side figure. 
And the inspiration for an inspired show by Anderson, the latest emphatic fashion statement by Britain’s single most influential designer. Staged inside Lafayette Anticipations, the art foundation of France’s biggest department store chain, the show was also a poignant tribute to a dark moment in the creative world of New York, when AIDS decimated the community.
 
Rimbaud was a huge inspiration to Wojnarowicz who built a whole art show around photos of himself wearing the same mask of the poet, shooting the images in daffy diners, disused parking lots and burnt out factories.Much of the collection was made up of humongous coats in a wide variety of textiles – padded silk, bold herring bone, crinkly jacquard or Scottish checks – often finished with JW signature oversized golden buckles that looked like magnified women’s brooches. Many coat shapes echoing the celebrated cover of Wojnarowiczʼs book Weight of the Earth, where he appears wrapped in a huge blanket in bed.
 
Similar enormous buckles finished colonial Indian white shorts or about town leather slippers. Though Anderson’s boldest idea were white singlets, finished with accordion silk waistlines. Or a natty series sweaters with necklines and shoulders trimmed in oversized faux pearls. 
˝Davis’s life was a dialogue of what was happening in America and the world at that moment. I find his was a very JW idea about blowing up things or using triangular cutting. Looking at how you do product that is substantial, and instead of having 15 coats have maybe one coat in multiple materials and develop it, to the point where it feels like it has always been there. Just like Rimbaud’s face. It is always there, almost like Marilyn Monroe, but a poetic underground version,˝ explained Anderson, surrounded by some 30 editors all straining to record his words on their mobile phones.
 
Even Wojnarowiczʼs work with stencil was incorporated into a series of great sets of chunky pullovers or wool-covered totes, finished with cut-out images of burning houses.

˝David was such an advanced artist he was creating art with stencils years before Banksy. David was America when it felt it was the end of the world, but it wasn’t. Just like Rimbaud, where there is optimism even if it is incredibly heavy,˝ argued Anderson.
 
The death of his partner, Peter Hujar, from AIDS in 1987 led Wojnarowicz into far more activist politics in his life and work – and an important series of memoirs and voice journals. Rimbaud died of bone cancer at the raw age of 35 in 1891. His tombstone in Charleville reads 'Priez pour lui' (pray for him). Wojnarowicz made it 37, dying of AIDS in his Manhattan home in 1992.
 
Their influence, however, very brilliantly lives on.

"Jan 15, 2020","The first most important news about the latest show of Off-White is that its designer Virgil Abloh showed up. 
He pointedly missed Off-Whiteʼs show in September in the Pompidou Center, but he was very much present inside the Carousel du Louvre on Wednesday morning, the first full day of menswear shows in the fall winter 2020 season in Paris.
 
The Off-White invitation read 'Tornado Warning' in quotations marks, Abloh riffing again on his artistic mentor Marcel Duchamp. It featured a teenage girl in jeans and white t-shirt fighting off the attentions of an angry skeleton, beside which lay a mineral water bottle and an Aspirin-like box marked 'Anything.'A metaphor for the designer’s announcement last summer that he needed a break due to exhaustion perhaps? That is what most people believe in Paris. In Milan, however, they tend to think that his fatigue was more due to the bitter disappointment in not receiving any financial reward from FarFetchʼs $675 million acquisition of New Guards, the DJ-driven Italian fashion group that controls the long-term license of Off-White. 
Abloh has yet to comment on that deal, and did not do so today.
 
Whatever his emotions, Virgil certainly staged a first-rate show. Opening with a brilliant tap dancer, whose mic'd-up feet produced a wonderful series of beats and almost military tattoos as the first models appeared.
 
Like the invitation, which had cut-out holes, much of the collection came Swiss-cheese style, from UK postal-box red double-breasted suits to a series of funky tops.

His opening looks included ponchos, finished at the sleeve by Virgil’s latest cool stunt, fabric ticket stubs at the cuff, which you know every cool dude will want. Ablohʼs education as a tailor also showed great progress. His elongated blazers hung flawlessly, as did the belted and minimalist Canadian trapper jackets.
 
A series of wacky party prints that featured champagne bottles and fancy spanners caught the mood, as did the fencing shirts made with multiple rouches. 
For his bow, Abloh matched through a central sitting room where the models had posed on the catwalk and then pointedly stood before the photographers' pit and slightly pulled down his glasses to eyeball the lenses. Not a wave in sight.
 
Post-show there was an almighty scrum to get into the backstage, where a tiny American lady staffer yelling, ˝No press allowed!˝ and a half-dozen security guards fought back the mob of glistening-eyed fans.
 
In between posing for photos, Abloh opined, ""I am in my own head space, but this is a culmination of a lot of work that I have seen. You know, I have been trying to make work that responds to my generation, and it feels like I am getting into a space where that is translating.""

"Jan 15, 2020","Toronto Fashion Week (TFW) announced on Tuesday that it is hitting pause on its bi-annual event, leaving many Canadian designers without a platform to showcase their fall/winter collections.Frequented by Canadian favourites such as Christopher Bates, Hilary MacMillan, Lesley Hampton and Narces, the event was expected to kick off in just a few weeks.  
“In order to best support the needs of the fashion community here in Canada, we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause production of our bi-annual event in order to rethink the platform and focus on how best to engage the industry, support designers and resonate with consumers across the country,” TFW said, in a post on Facebook.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“We remain steadfast in our resolve to continue to passionately support the Toronto community and champion the Canadian industry overall, as well as nurture the relationships we have built and maintained since the inception of Toronto Fashion Week, twenty years ago.”

Toronto Fashion Week has, in fact, faced hurdles for some years now.IMG first dropped the event in July 2016, pulling the plug due to a lack of local support, it explained at the time, following in the foot steps of Montreal Fashion Week, which was canceled in 2013. 

IMG Canada had operated Toronto Fashion Week in collaboration with IMG Fashion since 2012.

While the future of the event was unclear for several months, the official Toronto fashion showcase was then purchased by Peter Freed, president of Freed Developments, in December 2016.

Also joining Freed in the dynamic ownership group was Suzanne Cohen, co-founder of ASC Public Relations, and Carolyn Quinn, who previously acted as the director of fashion events and properties for IMG Canada.

Following this latest cancelation announcement, it is not clear if TFW will make a return in September for the Spring/Summer 2021 collections.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 15, 2020","It was in an enormous space decked out in blue and black carpet and featuring a giant disco ball that Marcelo Burlon County of Milan's latest menswear collection was shown. Perhaps it was a reference to Burlon's past as a DJ? In any case, the streetwear label's designer could not have chosen a better occasion to celebrate his status as a rising star and unveil his new brand image.The deep blue chosen for the show's backdrop corresponded to the brand's new corporate identity, thought up by design agency Bureau Borsche. The firm also redesigned the label's logo, distorting its symbolic cross into an approximation of houndstooth, a pattern that was repeated as a psychedelic leitfmotif throughout this collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21.

The pattern appeared everywhere, on coats, jackets, throws, jumpers, suits and accessories, creating a kind of optical illusion. The combination of black and Klein blue was also a recurring theme, seen, for example, on a crystal-embroidered jacket. Overall the wardrobe alternated sportier looks with loose, comfortable trousers, jackets, shorts and sweaters, but also featured military-inspired pieces in nylon and more formal silhouettes, suits and coats which nonetheless had a relatively relaxed feel to them – Burlon's dive into soft tailoring. ""I started with t-shirts and now I'm offering real tailoring with more dressy costumes. My streetwear has become more classic. I set out in this new direction last season because I wanted to go more high-end. But it's in this second collection that you can really see the difference,"" explained the 42-year-old designer to FashionNetwork.com.

For this collection, Burlon teamed up with Swarovski for his embellishments, Caterpillar for his sneakers, Retrosuperfuture for eyewear and designer Chrishabana for jewellery.

Fresh from a trip back to his native Patagonia, Burlon was beaming, clearly savouring his success. Born to an Italian father and a Lebanese mother, the designer left Argentina when he was still a child and moved to Italy with his parents. At 14 he was working as a manual labourer but, by night, he was also taking his first steps into the club circuit.From Northern Italy's Emilia-Romagna Riviera, Burlon moved to Milan in 1998, where he started organising events for big-name fashion labels, while also pursuing his career as a DJ. Since then, he has gradually shifted his focus into the world of fashion, launching his own brand in 2012 with partners Davide De Giglio and Claudio Antonioli. 

In 2016 the trio went on to found New Guards Group (NGG), a company that has become a major player in the streetwear sector, boasting a portfolio that includes some of the hottest brands of the moment, from Off-White to Palm Angels, Alanui and Heron Preston. Burlon owned 7% of the holding company, which was sold to José Neves' e-commerce platform Farfetch for $675 million last year, and which has just announced that it has purchased cult American label Opening Ceremony.

""I'm now one of the group's 'employees.' I'm paid by NGG as the creative director of Marcelo Burlon and I receive royalties from the sales of the brand, which is managed through a licensing deal with the group,"" revealed the designer. His brand is currently distributed by some 280 retailers around the world, as well as six company-managed monobrand boutiques, two of which are in Hong Kong, while the rest are located in Macau, Manilla, Dubai and Singapore. Its major markets are Italy, Asia – principally China – and the United States.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2020","Italian luxury brand Gucci, the jewel in Kering's crown, closed Milan Fashion Week Men's and passed the baton on to Paris on Tuesday, hosting a grand runway show that explored the themes of childhood and plural masculinity.""You are invited to my fifth birthday rave, Ale,"" read the show invitations, retro postcards featuring a message scrawled in childish handwriting. 

Indeed, the runway was the fifth anniversary of designer Alessandro Michele's first show for Gucci, who called him in to help boost its declining sales in January 2015. It was a gamble that paid off, with the Italian designer having breathed new life into the label with daring, often conspicuously floral collections, which sent sales skyrocketing 37% in 2017 and 44% in 2018, even if the pace did slow somewhat last year. 

At Michele's latest menswear show, the models walked through a darkened room, circling an enormous pendulum that symbolised the passage of time.

In contrast to this sombre atmosphere, the collection  – with its shiny silver or green disco-style pants, its green jacket-and-shorts combo paired with a purple jumper, and its vibrant honeybee-striped or check trousers – was positively effervescent as it hit the runway, backed up by the Eurythmics classic ""Sweet Dreams.""

Next season's Gucci man also wore some very feminine skintight blouses and some shirt-dresses featuring naïf motifs, a look that was combined with something of the spirit of grunge, as models coupled ripped jeans with oversized jumpers.

""I started here with a menswear show, so this show was an opportunity to look back at the progress we've made over the last five years and reflect on masculinity,"" explained Michele after the show.

""It's not a narrative that excludes 'mainstream' masculinity,' I don't want to deconstruct the masculine world, but expand it and discuss the complexity of being a man,"" added the designer, pointing out that this discussion also includes men's feminine side.

""I imagined becoming a child again, going back to that time when you can be free, with fewer labels, because when you begin to grow up, people start saying, 'you can't do that,'"" he continued, emphasising that this collection is ""an ode to romanticism and to men.""Gucci, which has shown its collections in coed shows hosted during womenswear fashion weeks since 2017, made its comeback to the menswear season with this runway.

The Florentine house was responding to the call of Italy's Camera della Moda, which is looking to revive the country's menswear fashion weeks. Thanks to the brand's return, along with a range of others, Milan Fashion Week Men's was able to reinstate its original format, finishing at midday on Tuesday, and not on Monday evening.

Next on the agenda is Paris Fashion Week Men's, which kicks off on Tuesday evening and will feature 53 shows over the space of six days. Proceedings will, however, no doubt be complicated by the ongoing transport strikes in the French capital.Copyright © 2022 AFP. All rights reserved.

"Jan 14, 2020","Paris men's fashion week began Tuesday with the French capital in a grip of a 41-day transport strike that has already led to the cancellation of one show.The men's collections dovetail into the elite haute couture shows next week, with the French label Christophe Josse so hit by the chaos that it was forced to bow out.

""We found ourselves unable to present our collection,"" the label said, because of the delays which strikes caused with their suppliers.As the elaborate haute couture creations are all made laboriously by hand in small workshops in and around Paris, the brand said it had no choice but to pull its show.

The US label RR 331 had earlier given up its highly-coveted haute couture slot, although they denied that the French strikes had anything to do with their decision, saying ""we will be back in Paris in July"".

With many models and fashionistas criss-crossing Paris several times a day by taxi or metro in normal circumstances, the French fashion federation has doubled the number of buses it is laying on between shows.

Even so, with up to 12 shows a day in the official line-up and many more outside it, the gridlock on the city's streets is likely to be highly disruptive.'It's a nightmare'A top stylist, who declined to be named, told AFP that the strikes were causing havoc in a industry where last-minute changes mean teams sometimes work around the clock to have clothes ready for the runway.

""Getting around has become a nightmare. It is taking people an hour or more extra to get to work and crossing the city at certain times of the day is a trial of patience. It all adds to what is even in the best of times an extremely stressful situation,"" she added.

Some of the temporary staff she hired for fashion weeks -- often from Italy, Spain and Belgium -- were reluctant to travel to the French capital to work given the rail disruption, she added.

There were signs, however, Tuesday that the record-breaking strike over pension reforms may finally be easing.

And despite the industrial action, Paris still dominates the fashion landscape, with the 53 official men's runway shows dwarfing Brexit-hit London, Milan and New York.

Men's fashion week kicks off Tuesday evening with the edgy Chinese label Sankuanz and punky New York newcomers Rhude.Vuitton backwards clockBut the frenzied merry-go-round of shows and presentations begins in earnest Wednesday with big-hitters like JW Anderson, Raf Simons, Valentino and the hyperactive American Virgil Abloh.

He will stage his own Off-White show 24 hours before he unveils his collection for Louis Vuitton, which he also designs.

With his millions of followers, Abloh has already won the week's social media war by sharing images of a Louis Vuitton clock that ticks backward in a countdown to his show which he has sent out as an invitation to the event.

He described it as a ""literal piece of time"" and fashionistas are already calling it a collector's item.

""The clock is rewired to spin backwards,"" he said. ""There's a metaphor in that, but also, as they say, 'A broke clock is right twice a day'.""

As well as his two fashion shows, the architect-turned-artist-turned-designer is also opening his latest art/furniture show at the Kreo gallery in the French capital.

"Jan 14, 2020","The Milanese catwalks witnessed a menswear collision this week. On one side, the classic wardrobe inspired by Italian elegance, refreshed with brio by Luca Magliano. On the other, Reshake’s pop-style streetwear, featuring powerful graphic designs inspired by Chinese culture.Constantly searching for authenticity, creating characters rich in colour and intimately connected with a profoundly Italian style, Magliano chose a Milanese billiard hall to present its Fall/Winter 2020-21 menswear collection on Monday. The models stroll through the back room of a popular bar, amidst green billiard tables, sporting a mobster bad-boy allure with suit-and-tie ensembles seemingly too big for them.

“This venue represents both working-class Milan and a darker side of the city, with its underprivileged outsiders. It's ideal for this season's theme, hovering between real life and the kingdom of the dead,” said Bologna-born Luca Magliano, who searched for inspiration in films by Fellini and Almodovar.The underworld reference is clear from the immaculate white ensembles, mirroring the pallid, ghost-like complexion of some of the models. Or from a wrinkled satin gilet seemingly straight out of a casket’s upholstery. Elsewhere, a masculine shadow, cigarette hanging from the mouth, is outlined on the back of a suit, or sketched on some of the shirts’ prints.

Three-piece suits in tweed, wool and other subdued fabrics feature destructured cuts and a palette of dark, dusty colours like maroon, mauve, grey, brown and sage green. The pleated trousers are so large that the belt cinching them at the waist sometimes leaves a section free. Ample overcoats settle smoothly over the body like bathrobes.

For the evening, the Magliano boys turn their jackets inside out, buttoning them on the back and showing off their colourful, shimmering silk lining. This season, the label introduced more fluid materials like polyester cady and viscose crepe. Knitwear, one of Magliano’s strengths, is also present in abundance, with ultra-fine sheer sweaters allowing a glimpse of the underskirt beneath, or with shirt-jackets in striped retro patterns. A pair of gloves is suspended from a chain hanging from the model's neck.Different continent, different vision. Reshake was keen to make an impression with its first Milanese show, introducing impressive looks bursting with energy. The label was launched in Shanghai in 2013. It is owned by Chinese apparel giant Mark Fairwhale and already operates over 130 stores in China.

The collection was inspired by China’s space programme, more precisely by the first satellite launched by the Asian country in 1970. Dong Fang Hong I was a propaganda satellite, equipped with a radio transmitter that was continuously broadcasting China's national anthem, ‘The East Is Red’. A thematic choice that speaks volumes about Reshake's ambition to extend the reach of Chinese fashion worldwide.

Reshake’s designer Jonny Fu creates distinctive high-end streetwear, relying heavily on printed graphics and illustrations borrowed from both traditional Chinese iconography and national propaganda images from the 1970s. For example, a satellite streaks red rays in the centre of a sweater, while the outline of the space craft and its trajectory are sketched in black and red on the white background of a puffer jacket and of sportswear sets, almost like a graffiti artist’s tags.

Other images, with their infant-like characters, seem to come straight from the world of Japanese manga. The illustrations are featured like wallpaper on a jacket-and-trousers set in translucent plastic, as well as on the colourful patches decorating a black overcoat and a down cape. The back of a washed denim jacket is instead emblazoned with an oversize fabric flag.

The style is masculine, the silhouettes imposingly extra-large. The models flaunt a warrior attitude, with chains around their necks and waists, hoods covering their heads. Others are bare-chested and clad in large shorts, happy to unveil their tattooed bodies. Generously cut nylon trousers with maxi pockets evoke a samurai look.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2020","""Let it snow,"" Giorgio Armani seemed to be saying with his latest collection. Presented in Milan on Monday evening, beneath a continuous flurry of virtual snowflakes, the wardrobe thought up by the Milanese couturier for next winter was received with great enthusiasm by his show's guests. The first silhouettes to come down the catwalk were covered with enormous ice cubes made of recycled plexiglass, looks that were part of Armani's Neve collection, dedicated to alpine pursuits. Wrapped up in snug blankets and cosmic ski suits with shoulders bulked out by protectors, the models looked like intergalactic explorers with their mittens, ski goggles and balaclavas. 

After the winter sports, it was time to head back to the city, where the Armani man pushed the boundaries with clothes that combined class and comfort. The looks dreamed up by the Italian designer this season channelled timeless style, preparing the wearers to face the most extreme cold but with a touch of tenderness. It was a wardrobe where formal wear seemed to shake loose from its restraints and develop into a kind of hushed soft tailoring. Stiff-collared shirts were out. Aside from a smattering of polos, models favoured crew-neck sweaters and jumpers, or gilets, opting to protect their necks from chills by wrapping themselves in scarfs or turning up the collars of their jackets. Others took refuge in shearling jackets and large shawl-collared coats with classic proportions but super-light structures, without a hint of rigidity. Some coats were made in astrakhan wool or shimmering velvet. Mandarin-collar jackets were paired with loose creased trousers pulled in at the ankle or tucked into boots for a retro twist. Other flowing jackets had been made like cardigans, in ultra-light cashmere or wool, while certain blousons and short coats were lined with cosy fur. 

The whole range of classic menswear fabrics was present on the runway and yet these usually sturdy materials here created an unprecedented feeling of lightness, an impression emphasised by each movement of the models. The whole collection oozed luxury, giving off a sense of effortless elegance as the looks transited through a dégradé of greys, blacks, navy blues, khaki and burgundy, masterfully interspersed with lighter hues.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2020","PVH Corp.-owned brand Tommy Hilfiger has announced the finalists for the 2019 Tommy Hilfiger Fashion Frontier Challenge, marking the initiative’s second year since its 2018 launch. The program, dedicated to supporting start-up and scale-up businesses developing solutions that promote inclusive and positive change in fashion, selected a total of six finalists. These six will now move on to the competition’s final event, scheduled for February 13 at Tommy Hilfiger’s Campus of the Future in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

"Jan 14, 2020","The menswear season in Italy ends on Tuesday morning after a pretty hectic week between Florence and Milan, where there was a marked yearning for a far dressier male. 
Italy’s great artisans were heralded in multiple shows, many of them with a rural twist, as a number of collections featured peasant sweaters, and earthy boots.
 
But it was also a season of pronounced escapism, as could be seen in a whole trend towards detachable tailoring and gigantic weekend bags.The palette varied from muddy and authentic, to a whole new fantasy wardrobe of acidic high color, whether used in classic wardrobes or techy nylons.
 
We look at seven key trends which any fashionista should consider when investing in their wardrobe for fall 2020
 
Voluminous coats
 
The coat of next fall should swaddle you, like the enveloping shearlings or massive puffer ski coats of Giorgio Armani, or in major league A-line form, as at Fendi. Or perhaps like the giant diagonal check seen at Prada. For funkier rock star evenings on the prowl, there were Etroʼs Navajo blanket coats and Missoniʼs moody Mark Rothko-hued woolen pelts, not to mention the remarkable streaky wool patrician coats at Zegna. But leave it to Dolce & Gabbana to cut the largest – a floor-sweeping double-face shearling with eight-inch lapels.
 
Big lumpy rural sweaters
 
Dolce & Gabbana led this look with gigantic cable sweaters where the thread was as thick as a thumb. Fendi showed humungous cable wool varsity logo scarves and Salvatore Ferragamo had lush cable knits, so warm you could climb the Matterhorn. 
Hefty but airy boots
 
Prada, Stella McCartney and Fendi, to name a few, all showed huge boots, many with thick logo soles. Though when one actually held them in one’s hands, they were all remarkably light. Stella’s brothel creepers almost floated, while the new foamy-soled No Code X collection of sneakers at Todʼs weighed less than 300 grams.
 
Corduroy comeback
 
From big thick-strand corduroy to shiny velour versions, the fabric made a huge return, nowhere more so that at Brunello Cucinelli. The designer wore white cord jackets to both his dinner party in Florence and his showroom in Milan.
 
Detachable tailoring
 
Fendi featured one triple-layer coat that came in mahogany, caramel and beige mink. Salvatore Ferragamo showed dashing funnel-necked top coats that looked like they could be separated into four pieces.
 Lively logomania
 
From pretty well every look at Fendi, to Armani’s new R-EA, or Recycled Emporio Armani, the logo has rarely looked so obviously vital. Stella McCartney even printed her name on the back of trenches, along with the address of her London flagship, 23 Old Bond Street.
 
Bright colors return
 
Up and down the price points, dazzling colors caught the eye. Tom Ford showed sherbet pink deerskin blousons, soft or rosé satin suits. While in Florence K-Way wowed with their bubble gum-colored nylon jerkins and packable windcheaters.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2020","The last leg of the menswear show marathon, after London, Florence and Milan, kicks off on Tuesday, January 13 in Paris. The French capital is something of a minefield, paralysed by a transport strike, which has been raging for over a month.

The situation for the Paris menswear week is further complicated by Gucci’s return to Milan, where it will close Milan Fashion Week Men's on Tuesday afternoon, cutting half a day off the Parisian program. The picture is completed by Paris’s constantly growing appeal, as the number of labels vying to show off-calendar is rising exponentially.Against this turbulent backdrop, the Paris Fashion Week Men’s dedicated to the Fall/Winter 2020-21 collections, ending on Monday, January 19, will feature 53 catwalk shows, as opposed to 60 last season. In addition, there will be nearly 20 off-calendar shows, an unprecedented number. The busy program and the transport strike are a genuine headache for the French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation. To minimise travel difficulties, the organiser is doubling the number of shuttles to the various shows, some of them available from the city’s airports.
 
The fashion week's new edition will, of course, feature leading labels like Off-White and Vetements, as well as the major luxury houses: from Dior to Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Valentino, Balmain and Lanvin, with the exception of Celine, whose menswear line has dropped out of the calendar this season.There will be two notable come-backs: Givenchy, which showed at Pitti Uomo last June, and Jacquemus, which opted to celebrate its 10th anniversary in the south of France. As it did in Provence last season, Jacquemus will present the men's and women's collections in a single show, taking its aficionados to the Parisian suburb of Nanterre, in the Défense district, on Saturday, January 18.
 Botter among new names at Paris Fashion Week Men’sThis season, the Paris menswear calendar will include four new names: Rhude, Botter, Rochas Homme and Craig Green. Rhude will be the first to show, on January 14, right after Sankuanz. The label was founded in Los Angeles in 2018 by Californian designer, Rhuigi Villasenor; its style a blend of couture and streetwear. On Thursday, January 16, it will be the turn of Rochas to present its new menswear, styled for the last two seasons by Italian designer, Federico Curradi.

In the evening, the spotlight will shine on the designer duo, Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh, also the creative directors of Nina Ricci, showing for the first time in Paris their label, Botter, winner at the Hyères Festival in 2018.
 
Rising star Craig Green, one of London’s most interesting emerging designers and is rewriting menswear codes season after season by blending workwear and futuristic shapes, is instead scheduled to show on the week's last day, Sunday, January 19.

Heralded among the Paris Fashion Week's new entries, Casablanca, the label by French-Moroccan designer Charaf Tajer, will show off-calendar on Friday, January 17. Among other off-calendar shows, those by Kidill, Louis Gabriel Nouchi, Natasha Zinko, Basscoutur, Amiri, Taakk, Tatras, Boramy Viguier (at the Tranoï show), Klaesi Holdener, Lazoschmidl, Gunther, Li Ning and Geoffrey B. Small.Among the 13 labels, which are not featured on the catwalk calendar this season, some have also opted for this formula, staging their shows in parallel with the official programme. It will be the case especially for Heron Preston, for Rynshu, which will fête its 10th anniversary on Sunday January 19, and for Pigalle, the street-couture label by Stéphane Ashpool, which will also show on Sunday 19, unveiling its new collaboration with Nike.

Other names, like Japanese label Facetasm, U.S. label Sies Marjan by Dutch designer, Sander Lak, and Andrea Crews, have slotted into the presentation program, which is growing in size, and which the Fashion and Haute couture Federation is keen to further enhance.Thom Browne, Kenzo to show during womenswear weekAmong the withdrawals, Fumito Ganryu, CMMN SWDN and Japanese label, Christian Dada, which has closed down. Thom Browne will instead show its menswear together with womenswear next February. As will Kenzo, which is set to unveil the first men's and women’s collections by Felipe Oliveira Baptista during the Paris Fashion Week Women’s, while Jil Sander presented its collection at the Pitti Uomo show in Florence on January 8.

Finally, the French Couture Federation is launching a new initiative during the Paris Fashion Week Men’s, expanding its emerging designers showroom, the Designers Apartment. Instead of being staged twice a year during the Paris ready-to-wear week, the new showroom, rechristened Sphère – Paris Fashion Week showroom, will showcase some ten labels four times a year, during the men’s weeks too.
 
The first edition of Sphère will première from January 15 to 19 at the Palais de Tokyo venue, with nine labels: Blue Marble, Boyarovskaya, Egon Lab, Ester Manas, Gamut, Kits, Mansour Martin, Mossi and Simon Lextrait.

A second session will be held during the February and March collection presentations, and it will also include three international designers: Germanier, Kenneth Ize and Thebe Magugu, winner of the LVMH Prize 2019.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 14, 2020","Milan’s big runway debut this menswear season was A-Cold-Wall, the conceptual London label from designer Samuel Ross, who was shortlisted for the LVMH Prize in 2018. 
Hence, every editor in town headed out on a chilly Monday evening to Palazzo del Ghiaccio, a former ice skating rink, to witness the arrival on the peninsula of Ross, an acclaimed talent back in Britain.
 
His show in Italy was clearly on Ross' mind early on when designing this Fall/Winter 2020 collection, which was a step up in terms of fabric and finish, when compared to the riskier approach of his previous shows.Ross made his mark with precise and concise technical and industrial street wear, but half these clothes would look at home in a continental drawing room.
 
It was interesting that, post show, the designer's publicists stood two handsome models dressed in very gentlemanly fare behind him. An ink blue double-breasted crepe suit, albeit worn with ergonomic neoprene sneakers, standing beside a cashmere blend petrol blue duster.
 
Ross also sent out some neat and unexpected suits, one in technical cotton, paired with a shirt-jacket, another in faded patent leather with a jerkin for the jacket.
 
Ross has also deservedly gained a reputation for artful staging – one of his London shows had a Dobermann barking at the audience, perched above a shadowy moat. In Milan, however, his cast looked almost overwhelmed by the massive rink, and somewhat lost as they walked between a series of large tennis court screens.
 
Fortunately, Ross came up with some great muddy, survivalist camouflage parkas, and dreamed up a sensational new malleable wire-frame hooded military gilet. Plus, he had all sorts of witty design tricks up his sleeve, from crooked-angled plackets to quilted 3D patterns. His penultimate look was also excellent – a see-through micro-mesh copper workerist faux jumpsuit that shone so mysteriously it almost looked radioactive.
 
""It is about modernizing what we already know. It’s an homage to menswear. Professional modernity, a dialogue with the illustrator, the novelist, the architect. Not a certain generation,"" Ross explained backstage. 
A-Cold-Wall was the biggest name in a large contingent of UK designers who showed in Milan this season, as the British Fashion Council opened London Show Rooms in the fashion capital through a partnership with its Italian equivalent, the Camera della Moda.
 
""I don’t think that bringing London Show Rooms to Milan was in any way due to Brexit at all. It was about doing something for all of fashion,"" explained Camera CEO Carlo Capasa.
 
""If you walk into any design studio here in Milan the teams all come from all over the world. Fashion is about getting rid of frontiers. It is politics that creates the boundaries,"" he added.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 13, 2020","Fashion brands wanting to know how to stage a convincing presentation should have sent an emissary to check out Alexander McQueenʼs event this weekend. For the UK brand’s unveiling of its latest menswear collection – inspired by the work of sculptor Henry Moore - was a salutary lesson in combining art, edge, taste and photography. 
And the location, a marvelous old factory just off Navigli, Milan’s canal district, was done up with perfectly worn club chairs and Gio Ponti-style furniture. The walls lined with massive lookbook photos, earthy images of these clothes. Think Celtic couture for men.
 
In the corner, a string quintet of two cellos and three violins playing chamber music, the very sounds that Moore listened to in his studio.Veritable top-notch tailoring throughout seen in three-quarter coats made of hardy, coal-black Donegal tweed, or bonded mineral-hued suede or some remarkable leather. The latter came courtesy of William Clark, the last Irish craftsman practicing the ancient skill of garment bettling. A technique used on linen in McQueen’s spring 2020 women’s collection. 
A brilliantly edited cast posed in remarkable Argyle sweaters made of mash-ups of maps, McQueen skulls and black smears.  Crossbred Celtic as well, with all sorts of blends of military motifs, harnesses and exterior hunting pockets – others were even finished with dark fabric thistles. Several looks embroidered with remarkable abstract panels and gestures composed of densely woven sequins, bullion and molten metal moiré.
 
Compliments also to Sergio Salerni of Urban Production, Italy’s best show producer, who handles everyone from Dolce & Gabbana and Valentino shows.
 
Milan, McQueen, Italy, Puglia and Celtic culture all happily meeting in an evocative moment.

"Jan 13, 2020","A red glow, like that of a dark room, pervaded the show space, as music from the soundtracks of films by Italian master of horror Dario Argento played in the background. Massimo Giorgetti had created a very particular atmosphere in which to present his collection for Fall/Winter 2020-21 in Milan on Sunday. ""I'm a huge fan of horror films, and especially films by Dario Argento. I got in touch with him via e-mail and he replied the next day. We met and it was an incredible experience,"" said the MSGM designer backstage, going on to explain that he had taken inspiration above all from the vision of the director, with whom he worked closely. The collection's labels even read ""Dario Argento x MSGM.""

Black and red dominated the runway, appearing in a bright red duffle coat, or in another in stonewashed black denim that looked to have been dyed with red blood, a substance which also seemed to have run down a classic herringbone number. The carefully curated palette included other hues inspired by the director's universe too: terracotta, cyclamen, emerald green and lavender, to name but a few. Long coats in saturated colours were wrapped around models' bodies, while one dark parka was brightened up with a turquoise lining.

Neckerchiefs and flowing scarfs floated as the boys walked down the runway in heavy shoes in white or red with black-tipped laces, footwear made in collaboration with English brand Cult. The ensembles were finished – of course – with murderous black leather gloves. 

The collection's pieces were printed with details and references culled from Argento's oeuvre. Carnivorous plants appeared on silk shirts, along with menacing cats' jaws and bloody figures that put one in mind of the posters and key scenes from Suspiria and Profondo Rosso. Etro's equestrian adventureThere was a radical change of register at Etro. Old family portraits from the 19th and 20th centuries abounded, alongside images of horses and riders, covering the walls of a dilapidated Milanese garage. The stage was set for an equestrian-themed runway show. But rather than the riding outfit itself, it was the attitude of the nomadic dandy that the Italian house had decided to explore for next winter, alternating cowboys with gentleman farmers, with a touch of nostalgia linked to a distant past. 

""Above all, it was the romantic dimension that we wanted to explore, as well as the link with nature, all while focusing on simplicity,"" explained Kean Etro after the show. Indeed, the designer skilfully combined stalwart essentials with richer, more imposing pieces. 

The overall silhouette was defined by high boots and wide-brimmed hats, along with throws that were either slung over the models' shoulders, or worn as ponchos or fringed shawls, channelling something of Clint Eastwood in his Spaghetti Western days.

Fringe also put in an appearance on the sleeves of suede jackets and dangled from the bottom of both a woollen coat and a hybrid pea coat that was half leather, half tartan, while metal studs decorated a range of jackets and coats.

Creased trousers were worn over boots, a look that was also sent out by Miuccia Prada at her menswear runway show this season. Elsewhere, simple turtlenecks were elevated by gorgeous jackets in macro Paisley or embroidered silk. Tweed suits rubbed shoulders with shiny or ribbed velvet, while jumpers picked up on the ethnic motifs so dear to the brand, and printed shirts were paired with silk scarfs, knotted neatly at the models' necks.

"Jan 12, 2020","Few events will better sum up the mega trend for polished menswear better than the latest show by Prada, where the spirit of New Wave encountered Italy’s greatest post-war painter.Guests entered the soaring Fondazione Prada art center on Sunday afternoon to find two enormous sunken courtyards, in the middle of which stood all-white cut-out equestrian statues. Pastel floor patterns, moody lighting and red archways all evoked one of the dreamlike paintings of Giorgio de Chirico.
 
""I wanted an anti-heroic statement, so my equestrian statue had to have spindly legs,"" chuckled designer Miuccia Prada.Yet, like the solitary figures that populate any of the painter’s oils, Miucciaʼs cast were carefully dressed, over half of them in refined coats – whether lush double-breasted shearlings, or slim technical gabardine raincoats, velour corduroy trenches, or steely gray wool town coats. The must cunning piece of outerwear was finished with large patch pockets in waterproof microfibers, like Dixon of Dock Green in Milan.
 
Busy young men, that walked quickly through the two stagey piazzas, as the audience of some 1,000 gazed down from elevated bleachers eight meters above.
 
Miuccia cut some incomparable jackets; with broad sleeves, five-inch-wide lapels and enveloping shapes they looked like they belonged to the models' big brothers. Shirt collars were long and pointy, with many models wearing thin ties and carrying satchels. Before the show went into overdrive with combinations of patent leather shearling gilets, slim pants and huge-soled wellingtons and farmer boots.
 
""I wanted to praise work. Not just the idea of the devoted artisan, but the importance and vitality of work for everyone. I think that the millennial generation didn’t quite get that. They think everything comes easy. But that’s not the case. You have to work really hard in this life to get what you want. The next generation seems to get that idea,"" insisted the Italian designer post show, winning the biggest ovation so far, after five days of shows between Florence and Milan.The soundtrack was a brilliant meeting of New Order and Richard Wagner, an assemblage of live bootleg recordings which meant nobody could track the tunes on Shazam. Two of New Order’s single covers were inspired by de Chirico’s metaphysical paintings.
 
""I found that remarkable, and the fact that New Order were into Wagner, they used to play Das Rheingold to open their concerts! When I discovered that..."" smiled Miuccia, indicting with both hands a path ahead.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 12, 2020","""I wanted to restore Italian buon gusto,"" explained Walter Chiapponi, the new creative director of Todʼs, using the local term for good taste, as he unveiled his first ideas for the brand.
 Presented in an elaborate mock-up of a 1960s grand hotel bar, his presentation was an homage to Italian modern classicism, from Gio Ponti to Luchino Visconti.
 
""I began by studying the archives of this special house, though in a very real way my biggest inspiration was signor Diego Della Valle. A man of taste with a great collection of art and fine objects,"" explained Chiapponi, after giving a score of menswear editors a tour of his first ideas.Ten youths posed at the bar of this T Club, attired in the chic casual style one associates with young men on this peninsula. The big news was the careful volume and graceful pants, worn with sleek T logo buckle belts, and the lightly faded royal blue jeans, which Chiapponi himself wore.
 
One had also to admire the reverse sheepskin blousons, unadorned blue blazers and, above all, a quartet of very attractive car coats. Made in English grouse hunting green wool or ecru suede, and finished with contrast patch elbows they looked ideal for driving and shopping in an urban or rural context.
 
In a word, a highly competent display by Chiapponi, who joined Todʼs from Bottega Veneta. In his new position he will work in tandem with another BV alumni, marketing maestro, Carlo Alberto Beretta, who also joined Todʼs last February as general manager.
 
Ever since the departure of designer Alessandra Facchinetti in 2016, Todʼs womenswear has been designed by a committee. Never the best of ideas in the long term.
 
The real acid test will therefore come in February, when Chiapponi stages his first women’s ready-to-wear show in Milan. One suspects he will need to take far more risks with that collection for Todʼs, a great Italian brand that has never had a major league womenswear hit.
 
Stay tuned.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 12, 2020","While a number of brands went back to basics at this season's Milan Fashion Week Men's, reviving their heritage and DNA, some designers, notably N°21's Alessandro Dell'Acqua and Marni's Francesco Risso, sketched out a bold new menswear aesthetic.  
With his fine cashmere sweaters which opened at the back, his azure poplin shirts featuring collars that extended into ribbons to be knotted at the neck, and his t-shirts in khaki or nude lace, Dell'Acqua gave his menswear a sensual twist. One classic white shirt even featured a cut-out over the shoulder blades, while woollen trousers were cinched at the waist with an extra-long belt that floated through the air, and leopard-print jumpers were made in super-soft mohair.

""My starting point was the idea of creating a new kind of formal wear. But this 'new formal' has to be constructed. Young people today are attracted to formal clothes, but it can't be too classic. You have to offer them a new attitude,"" the designer explained backstage, exposing the reasons behind the sexy aesthetic of his latest offering.According to Dell'Acqua, the collection has, in fact, been conceived so that it can also be worn by women, a consideration that could perhaps be seen in the feminine touch lent by an elegant trench decorated with giant lettering spelling out the brand's name, as well as by some sleek sweaters and pretty men's shirts. 

At the polar opposite of N°21's hedonistic sensuality, Marni took the attendees of its runway show on a journey through long metallic tunnels and into a dark and vaguely hostile universe, tinged with an apocalyptic atmosphere. The crowd went silent as a beam of bluish light swept the room. The movements of the models were slowed right down, as though they were struggling against some sort of viscous morass. 

Here and there, the light illuminated models with uncertain outlines and the clothes that they wore. Low-cut jumpers and tight, mini polo shirts were worn over tops with exaggeratedly long sleeves, while others left the models' midriffs exposed. At the other end of the spectrum, shirts with hypnotic prints were blown up to supersized proportions, as were extra-large trousers. 
 Some models' heads peaked out from enormous scarfs wrapped around their necks, while another recurring look involved oversized jackets, paired with maxi-shirts and giant jumpers, all worn like mini-dresses over bare legs and anchored with solid leather boots – a silhouette not dissimilar to that achieved at N°21 with a pair of boxers. 

One loose check jacket was frayed at the bottom, another looked moth-eaten. Cotton trenches and woollen coats had shiny collars that made it seem like their shoulders and sleeves had been drenched by torrential rains. The browned edges of some pieces made them looked burnt or singed. 

In a choreography thought up by artist and dancer Michele Rizzo, two opposing groups of models eventually assembled. The members of this strange community crossed each other's paths without ever touching, the men and women eyeing each other with a haggard, almost transfixed gaze.

This latest show continues Marni creative director Francesco Risso's ongoing experiments, where imperfection is ever more clearly establishing itself as the watchword of the brand's evolving aesthetic. Perhaps the greatest illustration of this new philosophy were the collection's hybrid pieces, such as the short crocodile-skin jacket that transformed into a long green leather coat on the other side, or the buttoned cardigan that was maxi on one side and micro on the other.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 12, 2020","A welcome return to form at Salvatore Ferragamo, with tremendous creative tailoring, gutsy accessories and some very natty avant garde silhouettes.It is always a tricky balancing act to lead an establishment brand like Ferragamo, but the design duo of creative director Paul Andrew and menswear designer Guillaume Meilland certainly managed that with this Fall/Winter 2020 collection. Above all, the clothes managed to be polished, grown-up and yet Instagram friendly, an increasingly vital necessity in contemporary menswear.
 
Staged in a medieval hospital, the cast swirled around the curving catwalk, loosely divided into six archetypes – Businessman, Biker, Racing Driver, Sailor, Soldier and Surfer. However, what stood out most was the courageous cutting, most notably the bold reverse pleats that created channels down the sides of pants. A series of eye-catching pea coats, intriguingly pinned at the side, again to create unexpected volumes, also looked great.The duo were also right in the zone of several major Italian trends, indeed, in many ways they were leading them.
 
Florence and Milan have witnessed regiments of posh camouflage looks this past week, though none so patrician as Ferragamo. Beautifully printed posh jungle and palm prints in ox blood and dark olive that looked made for no more arduous a manoeuver than a hipster officers ball. Add in fearless aubergine spy coats, nipped high up the throat, outstanding double-face donkey jackets and a way over the top motorbike mechanicʼs jumpsuit, and it all made for a great fashion statement.
 
Practically every collection in Italy has also featured hefty boots this week, though none so cool as the great Salvatore combinations of leather lower and fabric upper boots, made in the same materials – from chalk-stripe to herringbone – as the clothes worn above.
 ""A man today is not obliged to assume a single, set role. He can be a multitude, and he change his worn identity any time he wishes. That’s a freedom we want to explore in the 2020s,"" commented Andrew in the show notes.
 
In the past couple of years, the Florentine house of Ferragamo has suffered from flat sales as the house has awkwardly adjusted to rapidly changing consumer tastes, especially in menswear. However, this collection felt exactly right – a blend of high-class elegance, bold silhouettes, noble fabrics and editorial punch.
 
Earning a huge burst of applause for the popular designers as they took their bow after a fast paced show, backed up by a mash up of 80s dance tracks. For, just like the remix of the Simple Minds classic cut, on this sunny Sunday morning in Milan, Salvatore Ferragamo also feels very much Alive and Kicking.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 11, 2020","Few houses in the febrile and artificial world of fashion make as much effort to connect to their roots as Dolce & Gabbana, whose latest collection was a charming and delicate ode to Italian craftsmanship and earthy Sicilian roots.Two models even marched down the runway gently cradling spring lambs in their arms – even if this was a Fall/Winter collection for 2020 – both the little creatures looking thoroughly nonplussed. It may be the dawn of a new decade, but Dolce & Gabbana are far more interested by the sunset of their country’s centuries-old skills.
 
Entitled ""I Mestieri dʼArte,"" or the ""Skills of the Trade,"" the show and clothes were an extended homage to all those ancient artisanal skills, many of which are slowly but surely dying out.The designers even installed a gang of working artisans at the entrance to their show: four ladies furiously knitting in front of an elderly watchmaker and an even more venerable goldsmith.
 
While the show backdrop was a brilliant collage of black and white videos featuring wizened rural artisans, basket weavers, blacksmiths, shepherds, tinsmiths, potters and masons, to name but a few.
 
Remarkably, Stefano and Domenico for once did not use their signature opening music, the theme to Viscontiʼs The Leopard. Instead, the soundtrack was a half-dozen tunes by Franco Battiato, a marvelous Sicilian singer-songwriter whose songs explore philosophical and exotic ideas. All adding to the sense of event about this memorable show.
 
A series of molto chunky cable compositions that looked like the ladies at the front door might have just knitted them opened the show – big sweaters, jumpsuits, massive cardigans or Yeti-proportioned coats.
 
Before segueing into some taut rural pinstripe tailoring, the cast all in flat woolen caps, culling from those scenes in The Godfather when Al Pacino flees to Sicily and meets Apollonia.
 
Even the ancient skill of enameling was trumpeted in some great silk party shirts featuring teapot designs.Almost every look was anchored with hefty military or farmer boots featuring tire-track soles – the key footwear for next winter.
 
However, though certainly enjoying their earthy DNA, Dolce & Gabbana are an increasingly high-end label. Case in point, the brand has just added a fourth floor to their menswear flagship on Corso Venezia in central Milan. Besides the luxury ready-to-wear, there is also a rich new selection of super high-end watches, the latest picks inspired by the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci.
 
Very much targeted at the one percent of the one percent, the top of the line emerald encrusted Don Carlo, a unique wristwatch with its own patented D&G tourbillon movement has a price tag of – gulp – 675,000 euros.
 
A long way from the simple life of the artisan, one would agree, but nonetheless very, very Dolce & Gabbana.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 11, 2020","One day into the menswear catwalk season in Milan, on a crisp Saturday morning, Giorgio Armani unveiled his latest concept R–EA, or Recycled Emporio Armani, a capsule collection all about regeneration.In an ebullient mood, Armani even joked about Megxit, playfully suggesting that now the younger royals were flying the Buckingham Palace coop, he was considering employing Prince Harry as a model.
 
""You know, now things have changed, I’ve been thinking that maybe we can do a custom-made ad campaign with the prince…. and that’s a scoop,""  joked Armani.Fifteen minutes prior, on the catwalk, a squadron of models in sporty black and ecru R-EA looks climaxed the finale of his latest Emporio Armani show, staged in his custom-made show space in south Milan.
 
""It is a promotion for the whole Earth,"" commented the veteran designer in a post-show get-together with the Italian speaking media.
 
Made of regenerated wool and denim or organic cottons, R-EA featured hard canvas pea coats, hooded tops, padded survivor chic parkas and matelassé sweatshirts. All the cast walked in moon boots or with massive one-meter-square quilted bags. Practically every look was finished with ecru details and lettering, many items reading, ""I Am Saying Yes to Recycling.""
 In one of the strongest Emporio menswear shows in several years, Giorgio concentrated on one of his signature elements – herringbone. Incorporating the zig-zag into excellent red and black shearling flight jackets, precision cut blazers, and snazzy suits. Plus, there were all sorts of spruce houndstooth check suits and coats, some finished with mini metal baguettes, ""to inject a touch of modernity,"" noted Armani.
 
Midway through, as the soundtrack swung into the galactic funk of Robbie Akbal & Ay Sarita singing Fanaya, Armani went Space Age. Led by very cool padded nylon boleros with huge lapels, or abstract expressionist daubed puffer coats, ideal for foreign planet aristocrats.

"Jan 11, 2020","Oscar winners, uber influencers, surfer dandies, Italian race car drivers, edgy skateboarders, a regiment of buyers and scores of traditional fashion editors turned out in force on Friday night in a chilly Milan for the latest Zegna show, enjoying another memorable tour de force of paradigm-busting menswear.Once again, Zegna creative director Alessandro Sartori took his fans on a jaunt to the outskirts of Milan, this season a wickedly disused 19th century plant with mammoth glass walls. Setting the stage for a celebration of modern day mode and menswear.
 
The cast marching through the former iron foundry, around a mammoth art installation courtesy of artist Anne Patterson. A dense, maze like hanging of acid blue and lime ten-meter-long ribbons, though whose main aisle the stars walked for photographers pre-show.  Led by Mahershala Ali, the double Oscar winning thesp who is the star of the current Zegna ad campaign, hyper assured in a slim-line mat aubergine suit.Menswear today is witnessing a whole new revival in tailoring, powered by novel fabrics, and this show trumpeted that sea change.
 
For fall 2020, Sartori further refined his new directional suit, with the faintly wrapped jacket paired with sculpted tailored harem trousers. Made in cool jacquards, broken pattern Prince of Wales or eccentric herring bones they all looked great. They were classical but also unpredictable, capturing the new yearning for gentlemanly attire with unexpected polish and patina.
 Sartoriʼs outerwear was equally startling. Parka puffers in jumbled up pads of varying sizes, or artfully distressed leather donkey jackets. Best of all the enveloping cashmere wrap coats cut with elephantine arms.Moreover, the soundtrack was completely in tandem with todayʼs moody era. With French duo Double Mixte blaring out of speakers, with their hit tune Romance Nore.

"Jan 10, 2020","The Milan Fashion Week Men’s starting on Friday January 10 will introduce an unprecedented collaboration with its London counterpart. The partnership with the London Men’s week will notably enable the leading Italian menswear event to add to its calendar a show by avant-garde British designer Samuel Ross, with his label A-Cold-Wall. Also, the Milanese week will last half a day longer, ending on Tuesday January 14 - instead of on a Monday as usual - with the Gucci show.The Kering group’s leading label, which for several seasons showed its menswear at the Fashion Week Women’s, is now returning to Milano Moda Uomo, like N°21 and Salvatore Ferragamo. In addition to these three labels, the come-back list includes Iceberg, back in Milan after three seasons in London, Miaoran, absent from the catwalks last season, Prada, following its Shanghai show last June, and MSGM, which celebrated its 10th anniversary at Pitti Uomo.

These returns augur well for the Milanese event, which has been in free fall for some years, penalised by many labels’ shift to other destinations and formats, and by the difficulties faced by emerging labels as they try to consolidate their position within an increasingly competitive environment. Milan has multiplied its efforts to remain attractive, and announced the presentation of 77 collections for the Fall/Winter 2020-21, including 27 official catwalk shows. However, it was once again powerless to prevent a plethora of defections.Starting from those of Versace, which will show its menswear during the women's week, and Philipp Plein, another label whose men's line will show with womenswear in February. Among the repeat absences, those of Palm Angels, which has chosen not to show during the men’s week; Pal Zileri, missing a creative director; United Standard, which opted for a presentation; the same for Les Hommes, going through a transition phase with new management, while Miguel Vieira has gone back to Portugal. Other emerging labels which will not be showing this season are M 1992, EdithMarcel, Youser and Japanese label Bed J.W. Ford.

Milan’s collaboration with the British Fashion Council is extremely timely. It will bring a breath of fresh air to Milano Moda Uomo, with the eagerly awaited show by A-Cold-Wall on Monday January 13. Another joint initiative is the London Show Rooms, which will present the work of 10 emerging British designers and five young Italians studying at London fashion schools. Two major British labels, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, will stage presentations in Milan.

“We are a first-rate commercial platform, while London is more creative. We have always been keen to promote this kind of mix between the diverse features of each Fashion Week. It’s enriching. It’s also a very strong political message, in the midst of the Brexit debate, indicating that we wish that our countries will continue to collaborate,” said Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian Fashion Chamber (CNMI).Alongside these British labels, the Milanese catwalks will host three other emerging international talents this season: Danish urban label Han Kjøbenhavn, which has tried to gain visibility in Paris in recent seasons, showing off-calendar; high-end streetwear label Reshake, founded in Shanghai in 2013 and owned by Chinese apparel giant Mark Fairwhale, which currently operates over 130 stores in China; and JieDa, a label founded in 2007 by Hiroyuki Fujita, inspired by Japanese street culture. After working for 10 years in the textile industry, the Japanese designer, in his forties, also launched the multibrand chain Kikunobu, which operates three stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Shimane. JieDa’s collections are produced in Japan, and are distributed via some 40 retailers.

Finally, among the new entries, Marco De Vincenzo with the men's ready-to-wear line he launched at Pitti Uomo last June, and Italian designer Fabio Quaranta, who already showed in Milan in 2013 at the White trade show. Of course, the leading lights of Italian fashion all feature on the calendar, from Armani to Dolce & Gabbana to Fendi.

The city of Milan will also host a series of major events during the week. DSquared2 will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a show on the opening night, January 10, at the former Porta Romana marshalling yard, now transformed into a huge gig venue called Social Music City.

Ermenegildo Zegna will instead take the fashion cognoscenti to the opposite, northern side of the city, in the former industrial district of Bovisa, staging a show in a decommissioned steel mill. In the same area, on Sunday, it will be the turn of Sunnei, which has opted for a TV studio as show venue. The Milanese week, which promises to be very exciting, will culminate with parties by Michael Kors, Brunello Cucinelli and GQ. Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Jan 9, 2020","Jacquemus will showcase its latest menswear and womenswear collections simultaneously during its upcoming catwalk presentation.The luxury fashion label, headed by the designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, will put on a co-ed ready-to-wear show on January 18 during Paris Men's Fashion Week, reports WWD. According to the publication, the brand will host two co-ed shows per year in the future, during the French capital's men's fashion weeks in January and June.

Previously, Jacquemus has always showcased its womenswear and menswear lines separately, save for a commemorative 10th anniversary show held in Provence last June. The label introduced menswear to its offering in 2018. Co-ed and mixed format shows have been gaining traction in the fashion industry for some time now, with Burberry, Coach, Bottega Veneta, Giorgio Armani and Gucci among some of the major houses to take up the trend (although Gucci has changed tack for 2020, and will hold a separate menswear catwalk show during Milan Fashion Week Men's later this month). Recent converts include Thom Browne, who will switch to mixed runway shows as of Paris Fashion Week this February, and Versace, which will also host its first co-ed show next month, in Milan.

"Jan 9, 2020","Eyebrows were raised when Pitti first announced that K-Way, the half-century old French sportswear label, had been given one of the salon's prestigious runway slots. But the naysayers turned out to be wrong, after the revamped marque staged a zippy and witty collection in Florence on Wednesday night. 
And this first ever debut catwalk show for K-Way turned out to be the latest successful step by the Franco-Italian partnership that is rebuilding K-Way into a happening label once again.
 
Presented inside Florence‘s Rationalist era mini stock market on the banks of the Arno, the collection captured all the optimism of the acid colors windbreakers which first made the brand famous back in the late '60s.A techy hunter green duffle coat with zippered hood, paired with sporty shorts, preppy soft-collared top and prim cardigan made for a great opening look. Followed by bold Prince of Wales check coats worn with outlandishly large varsity scarves, or craftily padded puffers in bold blends of spicy orange and banana yellow.
 
Above all, the K-Way design team injected plenty of wit into the clothes, from space-age all-white hooded nylon cabans, or excellent giant, super-heroine matelassé parkas or enlarged houndstooth check figure-hugging trench coats. All anchored by tough-chic boots, marching to a fantastic French techno soundtrack that included tunes by Corine and Polo & Pan. 
˝We want to be a leading outerwear brand in the global market. Keeping a fashion angle but being contemporary, sporty and above all timeless,˝ explained Lorenzo Boglione, vice president of sales.
 
His father Alessandro Boglione saved K-Way by buying it out of bankruptcy via his firm Basic Net – owner of Kappa, Superga and Sebago - in 2006, before restarting the business in 2009. A decade later, the brand broke the 80-million-euro last year, according to Boglione.
 
K-Way was founded back in 1965 by Léon-Claude Duhamel. In an oft-quoted incident, Duhamel, while sitting at the Café de Paris in Paris, noticed a lady and her kids dressed in red nylon jerkins and exclaimed, ˝l‘en-cas de˝ in case of rain. And cas, pronounced KA, became K-Way.
 
Back in 1992, K-Way dressed the French Olympic team at the Albertville Olympics, however a fire in its main factory subsequently drove the company out of business. Now it seems in very fine fettle.Where once it was based in northern France, today the headquarters are in Torino. Marc Jacobs, Maje, Petit Bateau, Colette and L‘Eclaireur have all partnered with K-Way on capsule collections. Success is principally built on retailing in Western Europe, with strong sales also in Canada thanks to the brand‘s French heritage. K-Way now boasts nearly 50 monobrand stores globally and plans to open several stores in Asia – essentially in Japan and Korea.
 
˝The DNA of K-Way is the packable jacket with lots of color. We are all about easy to wear and travel,˝ argued Boglione junior.
 
The collection earned a hefty ovation, which had barely ended before Boglione senior jumped on the runway to make a short speech, perhaps more worthy of a provincial wedding, and not quite Pitti. Though he did sportingly introduce the ˝inventor˝ or K-Way Duhamel and also the head honcho of Pitti, Raffaele Napoleone. Wisely, neither of them said much other than 'Grazie.' The clothes had already spoken for themselves.

"Jan 8, 2020","Following the runway show dedicated to outerwear that it organised last June, Pitti Uomo has now taken aim at formal wear. How does one wear a suit today? How can menswear be made more contemporary? What of the traditional codes of the menswear wardrobe? The Florentine trade fair's organisers looked to respond to these questions and more this season, with a runway show that took place right in the heart of the action. Held in the open air, on the Fortezza da Basso's main forecourt, the runway show, entitled ""Otherwise Formal: Formal / A question of quality,"" livened up proceedings at Pitti Uomo on Wednesday, bringing clothes that would usually have just been hanging, inanimate, in booths on the show floor, to life. The show therefore not only gave a boost to the brands that participated, but also offered a new – and much-appreciated – experience to the retailers and distributors in attendance.

The show consisted of 25 looks made up of clothes and accessories picked from the Autumn/Winter 2020-21 collections of some 30 exhibitors, including Lardini, Ahirain, Raeburn, Pierre-Louis Mascia, Drumohr, Altea, Tombolini Running, Oliver Spencer and Roberto Collina.On the catwalk, a gardener carrying large buckets was transformed into a gentleman with a tweed coat and jacket combo complemented by double-layered shirts with checks and stripes. Elsewhere, a fleece gilet, a high-tech satchel and a hat with ear flaps effectively elevated a classic shirt-and-tie look, while a long black cashmere coat belted at the waist was worn over one model's bare chest, giving it a sensual twist. An argyle sweater was paired with a pair of creased flannel trousers, a camel duffle coat with only a pair of knee-high socks. Sleeve garters were also updated, serving to secure not only the sleeves of shirts, but also those of an overcoat, an inventive way of reimagining of a vintage accessory.

In the film, he talked about the challenges of learning a trade that has been traditionally linked to women.

“I will soon show the art of my people, from Magdalena Aldama, Chiapas. I’ll be in Boston from January 25 to February 3 to represent artisan women and men and present my textile project at Harvard University,” said the designer in a Facebook post.On February 2, he will show at New York Fashion Week, presenting a collection  woven on a backstrap loom, the traditional weaving style of the Maya people. He said this will be a unique opportunity to raise awareness about his work and that of his people. “I’m very excited to represent Tzotziles in something so important,” he told El Universal.

Currently, López Gómez leads a group of 150 female weavers from Aldama. Their work has been put together into a catalogue of designs and a handmade collection called K’uxul Pok’.

According to the media site, the designer wants to protect and preserve his community’s ancient weaving techniques.

Among others, he plans to build a museum in Aldama, visit Europe and write a memoir to promote his native culture.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."

Following the Shanghai show, the whole capsule collection is expected to be available at Diesel stores in China, as well as at the label’s leading international flagships and its main distributors.To create the collection, Pronounce’s designer duo travelled to Diesel’s headquarters in Breganze, northern Italy, in order to delve into the label's historical archives, featuring over 175,000 items.  “What hugely inspired us was the direction taken by Diesel from its inception until today, especially the extensive filigree work,” said Li and Zhou.“I was impressed by the items and the details Yushan and Jun picked from our archives, and by how they interpreted them in the most modern fashion,” said Renzo Rosso, founder and president of the OTB group, the owner of Diesel. Filigree and tie-dye techniques are the creative threads running through the collaboration, as the designer duo had fun playing with logos and detachable panels.

Pronounce isn’t the first Chinese name to work with the king of Italian denim. Artist William Chan and singer Chris Lee have notably collaborated on projects with Diesel, which in a few weeks will welcome a new CEO, Massimo Piombini, formerly with Balmain. 

Pronounce was founded in 2016 and is currently distributed via some 50 multibrand retailers, including Browns in London and L'Éclaireur in Paris.

Following Yolanda Zobel's exit from Courrèges, now it's Maison Kitsuné's turn to announce the departure of Yuni Ahn. The South Korean designer, who began working with the brand in December 2018, has designed three collections for the label, one of which is still to be released.

Her arrival at Maison Kistuné allowed the French brand to make its debut on the official calendar of Paris Fashion Week.""We want to thank Yuni Ahn for the important contribution that she made during her time at Maison Kitsuné,"" said the brand's founders. ""We are very grateful to her for having mapped out the route for our ambitions, a path that we will continue to follow in order to push forward with our development.""
