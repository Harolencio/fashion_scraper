"Jennifer Zuccarini, the former designer for Victoria Secret, founder of the first brand Kiki de Montparnasse in 2006 in New York, launched the lingerie brand Fleur du Mal 10 years ago. She celebrated her anniversary during the LA Fashion Week, organized from October 6 to 9.  
Guest of a first debate on the ""Business of pleasure"", the designer returned to her career and the development of Fleur du Mal, ""a brand originally thought for women,"" Zuccarini says, ""and to explore their sexuality in a beautiful way"", starting with a launch of collections for women, a mix of elegant lingerie, sometimes embroidered and sophisticated, supplemented by a line of loungewear dresses, a selection of bodysuits and sexy and latex sets called ""Pleasure"".
 
A universe that the designer expanded two years ago with the release of new collection segments celebrating sex-positivity, as well as a first line of men's lingerie inviting silk and even lace on boxer shorts models. ""Fleur du Mal is an inclusive brand, we celebrate all genders and sexualities,"" continues Zuccarini, ""and for our tenth anniversary we are presenting our first exclusive line dedicated to trans women"". Collections that the designer presented a few hours later at the club of the West Hollywood Edition Hotel. A memorable evening where the guests plunged into a red and blue light atmosphere, and discovered the lascivious Fleur du Mal models, all wearing the latest collection accompanied by music inviting you to shake.
 
After opening a first boutique in New York in 2017 and a second in Los Angeles in 2021, both of which feature the entire Fleur du Mal universe, the designer is expected to strengthen her ""Pleasure"" category in the coming months and invite new lifestyle items including perfumes and candles. ""We also recently launched a line dedicated to women who have had a masectomy,"" says Zuccarini. When we analyzed the market, we realized that there was no brand that offered pretty lingerie dedicated to this category of women and with which they could feel beautiful, so we imagined it.""The designer, supported since 2018 by the entrepreneur and investor Andrew Rosen, notably at the origin of the brand Theory, and having already invested with the brands Rag & Bone and Alice + Olivia, also announces to accelerate its retail development with these next years with the opening of 7 new stores.
 
In addition to Florida for the U.S. market, Jennifer Zuccarini also hopes to soon expand internationally. ""London and Paris are cities that interest us, as well as the South American market with Mexico City,"" Zuccarini continues. ""As we have done each time, we will start with pop-ups to test each market.""

"Guests invited to the presentation of Nanushka's Spring/Summer 2023 collection were greeted by a palette of pastel colors combining different textures and highlighting traditional craft techniques. The event took place during Paris Fashion Week, in a bright space located at number 51 rue de Monceau, where the Hungarian brand chose to present its latest collection in a showroom format, after having organised a runway show at the Palais Garnier in March. ""The main idea of this collection was to find beauty in imperfection,"" explained Sandra Sandor to FashionNetwork.com. The creative director and founder of Nanushka said that this philosophy ""has always been at the heart of the brand, but we are further emphasizing it this season."" The collection, which at first glance has little imperfections, featured flowy and suggestive juxtapositions in warm and neutral tones as well as reinterpretations of the brand's signature garments such as long knit tops or dresses, oversized shirts, wide and structured blazers, fitted skirts and satin pants. 

A contemporary touch was brought by bohemian embroidery and revisited logos: a discreet lowercase ""n"" adorned turtleneck T-shirts and denim ensembles with tone-on-tone prints, in both the women's and men's lines. ""The brand's menswear is in a way the little brother of the Nanushka woman. The design teams work very closely together,"" said the London College of Fashion graduate regarding the aesthetic coherence between the two lines. Initially known as a womenswear brand, Nanushka also offers unisex pieces as part of its men's and women's collections.Attention to detail was seen not only in the designs, but also in the construction of the garments. ""We really wanted to emphasize the human touch. A lot of the pieces were made by hand using traditional techniques. I wanted to pay homage to the artisanal methods of our craftsmen and for the garments to exude that personal touch and the emotions that are poured into them when they are made,"" said Sandor, proud of her in-house design team stationed at the company's headquarters in Budapest, an atelier employing around 20 people.Hand embroidered pieces, braided tops, draped distorted prints and unique handbags make up the collection, woven using a crochet technique used in rug making. The brand emphasized ""intuitive and organic design"". ""Our goal is to create a new heritage based on the idea of combining traditional Hungarian techniques while developing new innovations,"" added Sandor. This is embodied in one of the brand's most iconic bags: an oversized origami-style accessory that has been reinterpreted as a patchwork in soft pastel tones, made using deadstock fabrics.

""It's a very practical design that combines our values of innovation, craftsmanship and functionality,"" said the designer. The accessories category, which includes footwear, hats, small leather goods, eyewear and jewelry, is also seeing an increase in sales, ""Especially bags!"", said Sandor, excited about the category's potential.  In search of the perfect materialAn innovative alternative material to leather dubbed Oktobor, which means 'eco-leather' in Hungarian, was the highlight of the collection. Nanushka's innovation department has been working on the fabric for the past four years together with key players in its supply chain. The result? Lightweight and supple garments visually resembling leather, rendered in pastel colors such as light yellow, sky blue and lilac purple. The material, made of 56% recycled polyester from PET plastic bottles and 44% polyurethane, requires 80% less water to manufacture than other wet processing methods. ""Our vegan leather performed very well in the market, but this version is even better. It has taken us a very long time to get the exact effect we were looking for. Our goal was to find a new alternative to leather, produced in a more sustainable way, with a luxurious texture and a better quality surface,"" said Sandor of her new trademark. ""The beauty of the material is tremendously important. We don't want to produce sustainable pieces that are not beautiful and pleasant to the touch,"" she continued.

Founded in 2006, the Budapest-based brand is one of the first premium brands to adopt a sustainable approach with vegan leather pieces. Part of the Vanguards Group's brand portfolio, which also includes brands such as Aeron and Sunnei, Nanushka operates three stores of its own in Budapest, London and New York. The label is also distributed in 140 physical points-of-sale and in multiple luxury e-commerce platforms, such as Farfetch, Browns and MyTheresa. The company, which already employs about 100 people, expects to close the current fiscal year with a turnover of 50 million euros.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Appointment was taken at the Lighthouse ArtSpace in Hollywood, an entertainment multiplex used for digital art projections (Van Gogh among them), for the new edition of Los Angeles Fashion Week, supported by the CFDA.  Maxwell Osborne's brand was announced as the inaugural show. The New York designer revealed in 2008 with his brand Public School and now at the head of his new label AnOnlyChild, attracted from 7pm a large audience of 300 people.

The public had to wait for the official opening of the doors scheduled an hour later, while VIPs, media and celebrities were welcomed with tons of hugs. On the photo call, the rapper Tyga, the star of Black Panther Michael B. Jordan, or actor Jesse Williams, were photographed from all angles, all invited to cross a first room with walls adorned with giant screens broadcasting AnOnlyChild's color palette, then to join a second space, a large lounge adorned with mirror columns, baroque sofas and covered with Persian rugs.8:30 PM. After a few big flashes on Tyga, the AnOnlyChild show could start. It's getting late, the expression perfectly found to baptize the second chapter of the collection, after the first one in New-York at the end of September, presented with an attractive tag-line: ""a mash up of movement, music and most important, love"".

Walking on the excellent title Shots of the rapper Trust and the Back to Life of Soul II Soul, the models revealed a colorful, gentle and sometimes sophisticated wardrobe, always inspired by the Jamaican roots of Maxwell Osborne. On the menu: flowing blouses, voluminous dresses, shirts with wide V-necks, pleated pants, always matched with a scarf, always daring the color, such as a powerful and beautiful purple.  
Everywhere silk, from deadstocks or recycled, is invited on the collar of a suit, a jacket with large epaulets or adorns long draped evening dresses.The marriage of lace and a pleated satin dress scored points, and the masculine silhouettes convinced as well as the combination of mesh shirt, lace top and satin pants, the series of evening suits in lamé velvet and sport jackets, or the total recycled denim look.

One last lap, the music of DJ Nicolas Jaar ideal to conclude, the greeting of Maxwell Osborne, and here is the Fashion Week of LA well launched. Guests joined an after party at West Hollywood Edition hotel that was going to last.

"Professor Jimmy Choo’s JCA/London Fashion Academy is to host its rescheduled debut London Fashion Week show on 10 October, alongside its designer-in-residence, Patrick McDowell.The original 19 September show was postponed and will now take place across three storeys of the JCA’s Mayfair Building, commencing at 6.30pm on the Monday. 

The show was, like many others, affected by the death of the Queen with the funeral happening in the middle of London Fashion Week. It meant a scramble to reschedule shows, some of them taking place on other days during the fashion week and others being delayed by a week or more after the event.Showing first on 10 October, British designer Patrick McDowell will unveil his SS23 collection, ‘Marie Antoinette goes to Liverpool’.The show will be followed by each MA Student presenting their debut collections in the same space. 

Stephen Smith, founder and CEO of the JCA said: “Our upcoming London Fashion Week show is a momentous occasion for us all at the JCA. Since officially opening our doors only one year ago… we have nurtured our first graduating MA cohort from our home on Hanover Square. Opening our doors to the public one year on is the perfect moment to celebrate not only the successes of these hugely talented young designers but to also give our Designer in Residence and Sustainability Ambassador Patrick McDowell a stage within the building that inspired his ‘Marie Antoinette goes to Liverpool’ collection.’’ 

Smith added: “At the Academy we professionally incubate our learners as emerging designers. This means that our students will begin their professional lives from the moment they enter the Academy, developing their craft by establishing their own brand label, working in professional studios and through exhibiting, showcasing and trading in a luxury Mayfair location. Showcasing at London Fashion Week, and alongside established designers, is a natural extension of that approach.”

"Scheduled to open Los Angeles Fashion Week, the label created by Maxwell Osborne will present part two of its latest collection this Thursday night at Lighthouse Artspace. It follows the presentation of part one of the collection in New York at the end of September.

Before the LA show, FashionNetwork.com spoke with the designer. FashionNetwork.com: AnOnlyChild is inspired by your Jamaican roots. What connection do you have with this country; have you lived there? How did it inspire you in the creation of your brand?

Maxwell Osborne: My family is Jamaican and although I did not live there, I spent summers there when I was younger. A lot of it is not based on the look of the past but the idea of the playful joy they had when they had nothing. Entertaining themselves with whatever they can get their hands on.FNW: AnOnlyChild was born during the COVID pandemic. Was this crisis context an easy time to be creative?

MO: Inspiration was lacking at that time being that I'm most inspired by traveling. During the pandemic, I was able to reflect about life and what was happening in the world and look inward. Making something from nothing out of nothing as AnOnlyChild.  

FNW: You will present the second chapter of your first collection at LAFW; what convinced you to accept to show in Los Angeles? 

MO: I’ve always been drawn to the rawness of LAFW. We’re frequently flying in between NYC and LA to source deadstock material, so there was already a connection but overall it felt natural and the right time to present. And so it makes sense to show our first collection on both sides, hence part two, the B-sides. FNW: Why did you choose the name ""AnOnlyChild,"" what does it refer to?

MO: The brand name comes from my childhood of being an only child. Growing up, I had to make something out of nothing, such as entertaining myself and being preoccupied, which is the reason AnOnlyChild was started during a time of uncertainty. Making new textiles as all the mills and factories were closed. 

FNW: Can you give us a preview of what people will see at the show, tonight? 

MO: The New York show was called “It’s Getting Late'' and the Los Angeles show is called “It’s Getting Late, The B-Sides.” Like a record player, you have to flip it to the B-side to listen to the remaining tracks of the album. The collection is a continuation of what we showed at NYFW but a remix that still consists of silk dresses, tailored separates, strong suitings. However, there is “freshness” with new silhouettes and colorways for the West Coast. 

FNW: Is the choice to introduce more colors in parallel with a certain evolution of your mindset?

MO: Being that we work with deadstock fabrics the colors come to us… We create from what we find. 

FNW: How is the brand already distributed, and which markets are you targeting for sales? 

MO: When we launched, the collection was available through our e-commerce and in-stores exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue New York. We are expanding doors this season, yet we approach sales as a collaborative effort with our retail partners.

"In 2021 the festival was held in December, but this year it will be held in Dinan from Friday, October 7 to Sunday, October 9, The change in dates is a one-off, as it will return to its usual spring dates in 2023: April 21, 22 and 23.Chaired and founded by Dominique Damien Réhel, the event aims to reveal young talents who have just graduated from fashion school or already created their own brand.

This year, under the presidency of Stéphane Rolland, a selection of ten designers, presenting women's, men's or mixed silhouettes, will compete for three prizes: the Dinan 2022 Grand Prix, the Gavottes Prize on the theme of ""Metamorphosing Gavottes boxes into fashion accessories"" and the Public Prize.The International Festival of Fashion Designers of Dinan will also honor some of the competition designers from past years , such as Antoine Lebrun, who won the Women's Award in 2021 and Théo Boistel, who won the Men's Award in 2021.

"One luxury label cutting some clever moves, in both fashion and elsewhere, is the Ritz, which unveiled its second collection with hipster fashion label Frame during Paris Fashion Week. Part of a brand building project that sees the Ritz Paris open its first own boutique in Doha today. 
Frame X Ritz Paris debuted last October, and its first ideas immediately found favor with style conscious consumers. The new collection goes a stage further, adding a full family array of choice to around 20 items. Everything from pajamas and varsity jackets to funky patchwork logo jeans and a dog’s blanket.
 
Though its core is luxury staples - crewneck cashmere cable knit sweaters and thick pile cotton sweatshirts. All featuring various versions of the storied inn’s logo, and very much priced at the upper range of the market. Sweatshirts sell for €360 and cropped cashmere pullovers for €630.The Ritz remains a remarkable magnate for mega stars and VIPs. During the recent season, the likes of Bradley Cooper, Kanye West, Gwyneth Paltrow and Josse of BlackPink all rested their weary limbs at the grand hotel.
 
Frame X Ritz Paris now retails in Frame’s growing chain of stores - 15 alone in the UK and US, including three in Manhattan – and in powerhouse e-tailers like Net-a-Porter, Moda Operandi, Luisa Via Roma, and Frame Tmall Flagship. In the world of bricks and mortar wholesale it’s available in the likes of Harrods, Printemps, Le Bon Marché, Holt Renfrew in Canada and NK in Sweden.
 
During this month’s New York Fashion Week, the label also opened a large pop-up inside Bergdorf Goodman, finished with classy Director doors, echoing the hotel’s architecture. Backed up by a cool ad campaign shot by Alasdair McLellan, the brand seems to have significant global momentum.
 
So, we sat down with Natalie Barder, The Ritz board member in charge of brand strategy for the hotel marque. The hotel belongs to the Al Fayed family who bought it directly from the Ritz family in 1979, and the family often comes and stays. Daughter Camilla, who has a much-acclaimed vegan restaurant called Farmacy in London, came up with the idea of a Frame partnership.
 
Fashion Network: How do you find Frame?
Natalie Bader: I’d say it was opportunistic. We thought it would be great to have a partner like Frame that would bring a new vision of the Ritz, young, fresh and friendly. I liked the idea of mixing that with our great tradition. Camilla introduced me to the Frame team, and I met Erik Torstensson (Frame founder) and fit was immediate.
 
FN: Why did you not work with a bigger luxury brand?
NB: No, our job is to find new talent. For instance, we have taken François Perret, a great young pastry maker. And we will do the same with our new chef, a girl called Eugénie Béziat. She is still fresh, young and we will develop her here. Eugénie is from the south of France and born in Africa, so she has a sense of taste and fragrance that is special.
 
In June, Perret opened Ritz Paris Le Comptoir at 38 rue Cambon, allowing passersby to taste his signature whipped cream desserts like Barquette Caramel or Entremets Madelaine inside a bright white space lit by a giant Bohemian blown glass ceiling fitting.  
 
The Ritz’s grandest restaurant l’Espadon, closed during the Covid Pandemic, and will open next September with Béziat in charge of the kitchen. At her restaurant La Flibuste in the Alpes-Maritimes, the 38-year-old Béziat was noted for her audacious recipes such as red mullet, helicryse, carrot tops and artichoke with cocoa. Currently, the Ritz’s main restaurant is the Brassiere Vendome, near its front door on the square of the same name.
 
FN: What was you brief with Frame?
NB: The brief was to keep the spirit of grand classic, but with a twist of their modernity and expertise in producing clothes. This is why there is cashmere and expensive fabrics. And to find a creative twist from hospitality, like on the back of the sweatshirt where it reads, Junior Suite. Keeping the color codes of the Ritz - navy blue, white and our burgundy, which is in our Vendome restaurant.
 
FN: What was your retail plan for the collab’?
NB: First, the collection sold in Frame boutiques and partners, and in our little concept store here in the Ritz. Plus, they have a distribution network we appreciated. Now, with this second collection we have been very nicely exposed in Frame boutiques. I was in New York for its fashion week, and we had big windows in Frames three stores, on Madison, in Soho and in the Meatpacking District, and in their big corner in Bergdorf Goodman.

FN: What is the business arrangement?
NB: It is a license, and they pay us a percentage of sales. Which is great and we love it. They listen to us, and we discuss our ideas. And they absolutely respect our concept.
 
FN: Revenues and sales?
NB: I cannot tell you, but I think it has been very good for Frame. But, sales wise we are talking about several tens of millions in revenue.
 
FN: From a brand building point of view, what is your next move?
NB: We are now developing with the Ritz different activities out of this building. We will open the first ever Ritz boutique in Doha, in Galeries Lafayette on October 6. It will sell the full universe of The Ritz – tableware, robes, linen, fragrance, candles and teddy bears! Our new line of candles in porcelain will retail for 280 euros, with Haviland from Limoges, with whom they have worked since 1898, the year the hotel opened.
 
FN: Would you ever build another Ritz?
NB: Yes, we are working on it right now. We are looking at possible locations. Not in America, as there is the Ritz Carlton. Maybe in Asia, maybe in Tokyo. We don’t know yet but we are working on it. Voila!
 
FN: What is the annual turnover of the Ritz?
NB: What do you think?
 
FN: Depends on how many rooms you have?
NB: We have 140 rooms, but they are not all rooms, but many suites and half suites. And, we have the restaurant and the salons to rent.
 
FN: So, about 300 million euros?
NB: About.
 
FN: Is any hotel as good as the Ritz?
NB: No, we are an icon. And in terms of performance, we are the best. In terms of per key rate, we are the very best.

"Inditex and IndustriALL have strengthened their commitment to improve working conditions in the textile supply chain with the signing of a new protocol on the 15th anniversary of the signing of their global framework agreement, as reported by the company in a statement.The new agreement was signed on Tuesday by the CEO of Inditex, Oscar García Maceiras, and the general secretary of IndustriALL global union, Atle Hoie.

By strengthening the Global Union Committee and its coordinating bodies, the new protocol furthers social dialogue through the establishment of new mechanisms that reinforce the role of local unions and move towards a better understanding of the needs of workers in the Inditex Group's supply chain.With this new protocol, Inditex and IndustriALL will formulate a joint work plan that will focus on continued respect for the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the provision of training to workers' representatives, the textile group's suppliers and factory workers in its supply chain.

The two entities are also making progress on a new workplace access protocol, which aims to deepen the knowledge and monitoring of working conditions in the factories in Inditex's supply chain.

""The protocol signed today, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the framework agreement between Inditex and IndustriALL, evidences our determination to strengthen respect for fundamental labor rights across our supply chain and marks a fresh milestone in both IndustriALL and Inditex's ongoing mission of improving the lives of the women and men who populate it,"" said Garcia Maceiras.

Meanwhile, Hoie stressed that this agreement ""was a breakthrough that has since lead the way for more responsible sourcing and proper industrial relations in the sector."" ""The fact that we agree with Inditex to increase the role of our local and national unions and to firmly defend their right to organize and bargain collectively in supply chains gives hope to many,"" he added.

The Director of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Spain, Félix Peinado, who was present at the signing ceremony, expressed his satisfaction with the agreement. ""Spanish trade unions Comisiones Obreras and UGT, together with Inditex, have been frontrunners in Spain with this agreement. I could not be prouder of this agreement or happier to celebrate its anniversary. The agreement is an example of how, with the combined commitment and hard work of companies and their workers' representatives, it is possible to forge better working conditions around the world,"" he said.

This agreement marks a new milestone in the ongoing partnership between Inditex and IndustriALL, which began 15 years ago, in 2007, with the signing of the Global Framework Agreement, which represented a significant breakthrough for the industry, as well as a major boost to its sustainability and a real opportunity to improve the working conditions of the almost millions of people who work in the factories manufacturing for Inditex worldwide.

"The marathon of women's ready-to-wear shows for spring-summer 2023 ended on Tuesday with many surprises. The designers once again gave their vision of the tragic times the world is going through, with true manifesto collections. From Miu Miu's call for simplicity to Xuly.Bët's ecological alert, via Ungaro's quest for positivity.
  
Miu Miu condenses in one collection the new ideal wardrobe, both easy and special, sporty and chic. Miuccia Prada starts with her most classic pieces - the jacket, the coat, the shirt, the pleated skirt and the knitwear - which she mixes and revisits with subtlety. The result is a very Prada Miu Miu collection. A collection that also seems to be strongly linked to the Milanese label's flagship line, presented last week in Milan in a spirit of new austerity.
 
Thus, the mini silhouette is constructed as simply as possible from a layering of white and grey T-shirts over ultra-fine beige or light grey knitwear. The men's jacket is slipped over a bra and, optionally, a pleated or wrap skirt in grey flannel and black wool.
 
This summer's dressing room cannot miss the house's emblematic nylon, which plays the starring role, in white shirts, skirts and little dresses with zips at the front or back, or in dresses with straps gathered at the neckline. This ultra-light fabric is also used, of course, as a windbreaker in collared shirts or in a khaki version worn inside out for a blouse effect.

Leather is used in this urban wardrobe, at first in small details, in overskirts with large patch pockets, a bit like a fanny pack. Good old worn leather, which the designer also uses to cut large sleeveless coats, waistcoats or jackets, all of which also have maxi pockets. Smooth, lighter leather is used to make shirts, skirts, trousers and shorts in different colours. In another variation, the same pieces are cut from faded denim to give them the same leather wear.In the evening, the Miu Miu girl has fun with transparencies. A simple layer of impalpable fabric is all that is needed to compose a top and a skirt, placed directly on the body, which is sometimes illuminated with stones and crystals.

 A change of scenery with Xuly.Bët, who closed fashion week on Tuesday evening with a memorable and energetic public show in the heart of Paris, just behind the town hall. An environmentalist before his time, the designer Lamine Badian Kouyaté, originally from Mali, chose the Place Baudoyer, where the Climate Academy is located, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his brand. The idea was for the runway to be in the building, but this was refused. He had nevertheless been granted permission to hold his show in the square, but was turned away at the last minute.
 
He therefore retreated to the neighbouring François Miron street, bringing with him a large and friendly audience. As the sound system was also forbidden, the models went out without music, accompanied only by a small speaker in their hands, encouraged by the ""ouh ouh"" and applause of the public.
 
Perched on transparent high-heeled sandals with gaiters and split skirts, or in shimmering dresses and tops and white Catwoman suits, they made their way down the catwalk to the cheers of the audience.

""Magnificent!""

""Beautiful!""

""Bravo!"" from the fans. Some of the girls responded by improvising a dance step in front of a few bewildered passers-by, while buses and taxis continued to pass by in the street.
 
A joyful atmosphere, from which the name of the brand seems to have taken all its meaning. Xuly.Bët means ""open your eyes"" in Wolof. ""For 30 years, we have been alerting everyone to the damage our profession is doing to the planet. Today, the world is burning, but nothing is happening. We have to shout,"" said Kouyaté backstage at the fashion show. Self-taught, he switched to fashion after studying architecture, and from the outset the designer seduced people with his approach, recycling clothes salvaged from second-hand stores to make unique pieces. Transferred to New York in 2015, he made his big return to the Parisian catwalks in 2020.

 Make way for lightness and colour at Ungaro. ""With fashion, we have the power to make people smile and bring them joy. I wanted to inject a little beauty into a world that is not really beautiful at the moment,"" says creative director Kobi Halperin, who was inspired by Gauguin's trip to Haiti for next summer. ""Paradise is not only there, it can also be here and in our heads. That's why I wanted to create something special and exotic.
 
The designer drew from the archives while reflecting on the evolution of today's woman, for whom he designed an effortless and airy wardrobe, emphasising movement with ""sexy and elegant"" fringed dresses. Vapid yellow or turquoise dresses feature the iconic Diva pleat, light blouses are embellished with embroidered flowers, and vestal draped outfits are printed with lush carnation flower motifs.
 
White cotton lace jackets let the air flow. Stretch silk tops are paired with fringed cropped trousers. Everything is light and fluid.

"The first 2023 edition of Madrid’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week will be staged on February 15-19 at pavilion 14.1 of the Ifema Madrid exhibition centre, and elsewhere in the Spanish capital with its off-calendar programme.As the organisers announced on Tuesday, MBFW will be back to its usual slot in the international fashion week calendar. The event will be holding its 77th edition in February as customary, after the pandemic forced the organisers to postpone previous sessions to March, in 2022, and April, in 2020.

A new edition that, though not yet “officially open to applications,” is already generating “high expectations” among Spanish fashion designers and “a high volume of participation requests,” far in excess of the numbers recorded at MBFW’s most recent pre-pandemic editions. © EFE 2022.

"On the final day of the 26-day international catwalk season, Chanel staged a magnificent show in Virginie Viard’s homage to Last Year at Marienbad; Nicolas Ghesquière pulled off an agenda-setting collection for Louis Vuitton and A.W.A.K.E. Mode returned to Paris with experimental brio.  Chanel: Welcome back to MarienbadThe movie star was American and the photographers Dutch but this was the most French collection we’ve seen from Chanel in some time, presented impeccably before an enormous backdrop of film classic Last Year at Marienbad.A spring/summer 2023 collection staged before a truly gargantuan wraparound screen of 200 meters long and 10 meters high, projecting the black and white 1961 movie, and its central star Delphine Seyrig, whom fashion historians will recall was dressed mainly by Chanel.

A flotilla of hundreds of chauffeur driven limousines delivered some 1,500 guests to the show inside the Grand Palais Ephemère, where two entrance tunnels featured a collage of historical images and a great new campaign starring Kristen Stewart and shot by photo legends Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. The actual show intro was a charming little vignette film of Stewart out and about in Paris with four lotharios in tuxedos.“We are living in such an accelerated period of growth it gives me whiplash… It’s exhilarating,” says Stewart, as the camera captures her being pulled back by an invisible force in a Parisian impasse.

“It’s highly pressurised, as we are in this life-long, evolving art-changing project. To know who you are is subject to change. It’s not a fixed notion, the morphologies that define us and unite us,” she continues, answering an unseen interviewer as she emerged with from Le Champo, an art movie house in St Germain. Stewart even marches down Chanel’s famous glass walled staircase in its rue Cambon headquarters, attired in a shiny white bouclé suit that then appeared in the show.

The collage even featured in the opening look, a printed shirt worn over silk bloomers and flat shoes. Images of the symmetrical grand gardens of Bavaria where the film was shot evident on shirt and screen.

Chanel’s creative director Virginie Viard went for short this season, favouring the classic Chanel four-pocket jacket made as a dress but well up the thigh. She even made a lovely version in violet with a front placket. And when Virginie did send out a classic silken tweed jacket, she oft paired it with shorts.  

Her preferred footwear were black-toed pumps with floral straps worn with fishnet knee socks. Though there was nothing retro about these clothes from the polkadot trenches cinched by metal belts, to the pearl studded leather cocktails. 

While for evening, Viard wove in all sorts of feathers, rhinestones and bows that recalled the opulence of the film, none of which was shot in the Czech spa town after which it was named.

“The films we have seen, those that possess us and those we invent for ourselves, Marienbad, the Nouvelle Vague, the allure according to Gabrielle Chanel, Karl, the night, feathers, sequins, heels: I like it when things get mixed up,” remarked Viard.

What made this collection special was the ambiguity that defines Last Year at Marienbad. In the film, one is never certain if the couple had met one year before as the man insists, but the woman doesn’t recall. And in the collection one is never quite sure of the exact epoch of the clothes, yet somehow they are pretty much all clear expressions of Chanel’s DNA - poise, allure, polish and impertinence.Louis Vuitton: Nicolas sets the agenda again Sport met couture, hardware and amusement arcades in a tremendously forceful show at the Louvre by Louis Vuitton to round off four weeks of runway collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris. Last, but very much not least, this was a chic and startling collection by Nicolas Ghesquière for Vuitton, possibly his most brilliant to-date for the luxury marque. 

Staged in a pretty awesome setting, a giant elevated circular platform, where modes marched past open curtains as a bright sun peeped through a white sky. A set the brand entitled as a 'Flower Monster', courtesy of artist Philippe Parreno.

Above all, there was a wonderful sense of a humour about the clothes, which incorporated all sorts of LV equipment: closures, buckles, clasps, hinges and giant zips as objects or as prints. A heroic collection and show, opened by some brilliantly cut waistcoats and skirts reinforced by accordion pleat fabric tubes and held together by six-inch zip pull tabs.

Nicolas stepped that idea up a gear with some stunning prints, where meter-long grommet belts ran down the sides of blazers and the sleeves were printed in golden zips. Printed on leather or silk, they were zany, demanding to wear but unexpected and daring. Before going into overdrive with color blocking patchwork-leather baby doll dresses fronted by huge bows.

Plus, Ghesquière’s ingenious bags were first rate: like a smart new tote in the shape of a leather key holder, or another in the form of a huge baggage tag.

Though, the best moment was a sturdy replica bag of the founding family’s historic home in Asnières-sur-Seine. Almost a gingerbread house version of the original.

When it came to footwear, Nicolas was again thinking out of the box - with a new boxing boot meets techy sneaker. Ergonomic, funky and sprinkled with crystals, they will be huge hits, and influential.

Matter of fact, it has been some time since Ghesquière pulled off an agenda-setting collection, one that would drive the fashion zeitgeist. This collection will.    A.W.A.K.E. Mode: Experiments with brioOne of the more compelling voices in fashion design today is Natalia Alaverdian, the founder and designer of A.W.A.K.E. Mode, which staged its latest collection inside the American Cathedral of Paris.In whose hallowed halls, A.W.A.K.E. Mode presented a multi-material and highly experimental show, that ranged from romanticism to rough refinement. Far too many designers have come out of the pandemic playing safe, clinging to their self-perceived codes and DNA. Not Alaverdian, whom to her credit, continues to break new ground in terms of structure and vision.
 
Alaverdian is certainly skilled tailor, playing with proportions with audacity in tulip sleeved cotton dresses; open shouldered parachute silk baseball jackets or flight jackets, as well as some tremendous skirts finished at the bottom by menswear shirt cuffs.

She showed marvellous pencil skirts, beautiful draped culottes and scalloped front cocktails, while her sense of asymmetrical draping in flared skirts was admirable.

Natalia had two big ideas this season, the first being woven and mosaic leather. Seen in some great ecru, honey beige or contrast color skirts cut half-way down the calf. The other was intricate layering made in cut out squares and circles. Used to charming effect in cocktail dresses and art gallery opening evening gowns. 

Her experiments continued in accessories - from the woven metallic perspex heels, to perforated mesh mules.

At times, one cried out for the self editing button, as she piled on the cut-outs and foils. For often, the best ideas were the simplest - one shoulder recycled denim tops and flared bias-cut dresses.

Presented on a clever casting, given a Viking touch with their Valkyrie hairstyles.Though the opening the show with a bombastic industrial soundtrack just felt odd inside a church. 

The designer took a short bow before explaining backstage that, because the house had built up a substantial business online during the pandemic, she felt closer to her clients and more able to take more risks in her designs.

“Structure and experimenting with texture. There were lots of elements I had previously tried and they all came together this season,” smiled the designer, before embracing one of her biggest fans, Doja Cat, the rapper’s hair, neck and face all painted gold.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"In a standout moment from this Paris Fashion Week, the Coperni label ended its runway show by unveiling a dress of a whole new kind, literally painted live on Bella Hadid in front of a captivated audience. This striking image is now all over the web, proving a viral hit on social networks.Upcycling is a practice that is gradually becoming part of consumer buying behavior. But while shoppers now know that it's possible to transform waste of all kinds into clothing, they may not be aware that it's possible to turn a simple liquid into a spectacular dress. However, this is what the designers Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant, at the helm of the Coperni fashion house, did during this latest edition of Paris Fashion Week.

Top model Bella Hadid was chosen to close the show, but this time there was no question of a regular runway walk. Instead, the young model positioned herself in front of the guests in her underwear, waiting for the designers to work their magic. Which they then did, by spraying Bella Hadid with a white product. According to Vogue Business, this was a liquid containing cotton and synthetic fibers combined with a polymer solution, which transforms into fabric upon contact with the skin. Incredible, but true.This performance worthy of a science fiction scene has undoubtedly had the desired effect, as it went viral in a matter of hours. It led to tens of thousands of posts on Instagram, and even more ""likes,"" while the hashtag #sprayondress already counts over 3 million views on TikTok.

With its Media Impact Value (MIV) algorithm, which seeks to ""measure and benchmark the impact of all media placements and mentions across different Voices in the Fashion, Luxury, and Beauty industries,"" Launchmetrics reports that the MIV related to this moment is estimated at $26.3 million in the 48 hours following the show, . And that figure should continue to climb in the hours and days to come. All of which reflects the public's enthusiasm for a feat that is far from becoming the norm, but which is clearly the stuff of dreams.

"On the Paris catwalks on Monday, it was all about trimming, cutting, tearing, recomposing, regenerating and embellishing. The designers, including Sacai, Rokh, Lanvin and Germanier, demonstrated on the eighth day of the women's ready-to-wear shows for spring-summer 2023 that they are masters of the art of scissor handling.
 As the guests streamed into Sacai's large, colorful cube-shaped seating area, the last of the models arrived in a rush from the previous show, Stella McCartney, driven right up to the stage door. Fifty minutes later, the show began with a black and white optical illusion with moving stripes, which came to life as stripes, fringes and pleats.
 
Designer Chitose Abe wielded the scissors with joy and dexterity, cutting the bottoms of double-breasted dresses and maxi jackets. Hems on dinner jackets and sailors with gold buttons were cut into strips, which blended with the similar pleats and fringes of the large white shirts over which they were slipped. Without tops, these same blazers and pleated shirts became strapless dresses with frilly edges.

While the clothes were conscientiously slashed and reduced by a third, arms and legs were given volume through pagoda sleeves and trouser bottoms that flared into ruffles. Teddy jackets, safari jackets and anoraks were in turn decapitated. Without collar and shoulders, they were worn bustier-style.
 
The same treatment went for the lower part of the garment, which was reduced to an apron-like mini-skirt or a belt with two large side pockets, to be layered over a dress or trousers. Very practical to put your hands in, adding an air of natural nonchalance to the look. Everything fit together perfectly in this desirable collection made up of unique pieces that are easy to match with each other. Rokh plays the same game as Sacai, from whom he seems to have borrowed more than one idea. Clothes are unhooked, unbuttoned, unzipped, untied or even unraveled, transforming for example skirts and long dresses, thus rid of their heavy draped edge, into micro-minimal outfits. Sometimes, the designer simulated tears, like the blue stripes that zigzagged across certain beige dresses.

Like Abe, Rok Hwang likes to start with wardrobe classics, particularly trench coats and suits, which he broke down to recompose into long, fluctuating silhouettes. A trench coat became a bolero jacket associated with a skirt made from an off-cut of the same camel fabric wrapped in a spiral around the sides. Layers of fabric with fine or wider pleats were mixed and layered in long asymmetrical skirts in canvas or vinyl.

The belts, punctured with metal eyelets, were wrapped twice, tightly around the waist, falling in a ribbon along the legs. The garments were open in the back with a central, vertical row of buttons. Details and construction are everywhere. Perhaps a little too much, drowning out the purpose.
 
Lanvin, on the other hand, was much more minimalist with sober coats, shorts and suits, impeccably cut in a neutral palette. Creative director Bruno Sialelli gradually introduced sophisticated details into these simple looks, such as yellow embroidery or white buttons on a black coat or polka dots on leather or orange reptile skin coats.
 
Brocade fabrics and printed silks brightened up the ensemble in jackets and long skirts. Tulle dresses delicately caressed the body, while slender draped dresses were tinged with pastels.
 
Oriental music and tambourines gave rhythm to this aquatic fashion show, where the waves immersed the whole space, undulating on the walls and the sand-coloured carpet in changing reflections; the sea very present in the collection. The women dressed in fishing nets, sparkling tops and tunics. The nets were also used as bags, covered in crystals. Turquoise leotards with bonnets, like diving suits, were also worn, alongside long-haired mules that looked like flippers.

 After a moderate collection, Germanier gave us extravagance, with a spring-summer 2023 collection that was particularly exuberant and vital with a super colorful, both very glamorous and ethical, festive fashion. The label's founder, Switzerland's Kevin Germanier, also wielded scissors to cut holes and slash white shirts, whose gaps were then decorated with glitter silicone. Elsewhere, he redrew the shapes on flesh-coloured tulle tunics, some parts of which were ultra-decorated with an accumulation of embellishments, while others were left bare.
 
This season, more than ever, the designer used everything and anything to hand to make his recycled fairy outfits: feathers, stones, large sequins, rhinestones, paper or fabric fringes, pearls. These different elements were arranged according to colors and shapes, in large garlands or volumes.
 
Decorations were entangled in fishnet dresses as though caught in a spider's web. Entire dresses were made of multicolored plastic necklaces. And light rainbow ostrich feathers made up a majestic capote with a large floating headdress to match, for a final, highly applauded look.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
"Paris Fashion Week Monday: Stella McCartney was all in the family; Thom Browne needed an edit; Zimmermann looked very at-home in Paris, and Lutz Huelle triumphed at AZ Factory.Stella McCartney: Family affairA full show of support from LVMH for Stella McCartney, as her brand’s backer, CEO Bernard Arnault and his three eldest children sat front row for the UK designer’s latest show.Staged outside the Pompidou Centre on a chilly Monday morning, with a collection that referenced the links between fashion and art. The invitation featured an image from Japanese graphic artist Yoshitomo Nara – and his slogan ""Change the History,” the same image appearing on a T-shirt on the cobblestone runway. Stella even worked with him 20 years ago when she opened her NYC store.

Plus, by being held on grand slanting courtyard at the modern art museum, thousands of fans had the chance to witness the show live. And able to enjoy one of Stella’s best collections in years.Presented on a series of colourful stripe catwalks, the cast marched at all sorts of angles, in a slight fashion malfunction perhaps. The collection, on the other hand, was focused and sharp. Especially the great tailoring, light and soft versions of classic Savile Row suiting, given fresh impetus with their savvy sense of volume and clever detailing. Pairing them with crystal and sequinned tops or body jewelry to add great punch.

Stella also draped with aplomb, with lots of racy bias cut cocktails worn with double-breasted blazers. And in a season of jumpsuits, McCartney showed some of the best - from soft buttercup fighter pilot versions, to a fully tailored tracksuit at the finale, worn by Amber Valletta.

Paired together with faded denim looks and a series of bags made in vegan leather. Stella still very much the leader in fashion’s slow march towards sustainability and respect for animal rights. Her long held positions, a salutary message to far too many of her colleagues.

All told, a fashionable victory for the designer, and a sign that her brand’s future looks far rosier chez LVMH. No wonder, her dad, Beatle Paul McCartney, was mock dancing in his front row seat, rubbing shoulders with his neighbour Bernard Arnault.

Who reacted by filming the finale on his iPhone, to the amusement of daughter Delphine and sons Antoine and Alexandre. Always a good sign for a designer when BA does that. 
 Thom Browne: Royalist ready-to-wear, American designerTalent often comes with self-indulgence, especially in fashion and, particularly, if your name is Thom Browne, as he proved with this show, held in a new location for the American designer, the Palais Garnier opera house.Thom is a great designer, who reinvented the men’s suit and, to a certain extent, the runway show. Turning the latter into works of performance art. However, the whole point of a fashion show is to grip an audience by a powerful aesthetic statement, not irritate them. And the mad scramble to exit this show - which lasted 45 minutes, where the average show’s duration is 15 - only underlined how relieved people were to leave. Talk about losing your audience.

Yet, there was plenty to admire about these clothes; whose key story was the meeting of crinoline and cape. First off a madcap version of a duchess having a Louis-the-XIV-fantasy moment, a towering figure in royal blue frock coat-meets-cape, with gilded embroidery. 

Next came a score of giant cardinal worthy capes, in hues of cobalt blue, mint yellow or creamy orange. Cut like a Velasquez portrait of a Renaissance pope, but with funky makeup Francis Bacon would have admired. Capes cut into giant ruched flowers and sleeves so large they could have hidden a basketball. Hair nets over models heads, hair done up like spiky phalluses. Giant clogs and running socks on their feet. If that sounds like rather weird that’s because it was, even if also rather beautiful.

Everything going into overdrive with pleated pinafores and puckered wee boleros, finished with Thom’s signature dachshund print. Done in the red, white and blue of the French flag.

His central circular motif all over the finale in multiple candy-hued redingotes. Polkadot overdrive that made the show stall. Clothes destined for a museum rather than real life. And, a moment for all his wit and humour, when Browne might have to rethink his obsession with performance fashion.

Even four flannel suited bearers carrying a huge pink half-sized Cadillac in lightweight mesh with Lady Penelope emoting inside could not quite save this show.Zimmermann: Wonderland in the Petit Palais Paris’ biggest debut this season was Zimmermann, a dynamic Australian brand, whose aesthetic best represents their homeland’s reputation as the 'Lucky Country'.Entitled 'Wonderland', the collection’s well-spring was a story told to designer Nicky Zimmermann by her grandmother of a long forgotten roller coaster built in the late 19th century, which has since disappeared.

Prints of that long forgotten big dipper, located in Tamarama Bay, where Zimmermann lived for over 20 years, were the key elements in the collection.

“An old roller coaster, it is unthinkable they would built it today,” laughed the designer.

Seen in gloriously color in bouffant frocks; ruffled cocktails; flamenco dresses; gowns with tulip sleeves and even laced up corsets.

Not that Nicky overly relied on prints - considering her deft use of white and ecru. You had to love the padded judo jackets finished with soaring collars; knobby cotton baseball jackets worn with ragged lace skirts or guipure lace blouses over Bondi Beach cargo shorts.

Tamarama today is sometimes nicknamed Glamorama, due to its chic local residents, but those of us who have surfed it know it for a legendary powerhouse rip that only the experienced, or very naive, tackle. One silk dress in the show even read, 'Surf to Grow'.

And brave is what Nicky Zimmermann definitely is, having the guts to take her brand to Paris before the toughest audience in fashion. And presenting a collection that looked very at home in Paris Fashion Week. Expect her to return.

“When we began making this collection I had no idea that we would be showing it in Paris. But after the pandemic it felt right to travel and to come here. I didn’t make any special alterations because we were coming to France. We just decided to enjoy the experience. And my team loved it,” she enthused.

Staged in the colonnade and garden of the Petit Palais, the show rambled and lost momentum badly. But what’s great about Zimmermann is that it’s a very democratic brand, that’s attractive to multiple generations and sufficiently flexible to suit multiple sizes and morphologies. This show and collection will win it legions of more followers. Welcome to Paris Nicky.Lutz Huelle X AZ Factory: Lutz loves street coutureThe unstated question entering the one-off collection of Lutz Huelle for AZ Factory was whether this fledgling fashion concept has a future or not. And the answer, judging from this collection, is a very definite, 'yes'.Huelle, a German who lives in Paris, is one of the most interesting indie designers in fashion, famous in a strange way for having his best ideas copied by many lesser talents. With this collection, it was about him respecting, and yet extending, the DNA of a house founded by the late great Alber Elbaz, a creator of clear and powerful codes.

Thankfully, the result was a balanced cocktail of Huelle’s street style, delicacy with denim and sense of rock n roll, married to the hipster grand couture of Elbaz, blended with the one virtual show Alber created for AZ Factory.

Though bankrolled by the deep pockets of luxury giant group Richemont, AZ Factory is very wisely managed like a start-up. Its atelier and offices are located inside the Cartier Foundation, Richemont’s most famous brand. And that is where they staged this show, before some beautiful works of demi-abstract Aboriginal art and watched by other amigos of the house, like Thebe Magugu, who have designed for AZ factory already.

Kicking off with The Undertones classic 'Teenage Kicks' on the soundtrack, Lutz sent out a great opening trilogy: snazzy, sleeveless tuxedo jacket, finished with black nylon ruffled elbows over denim shorts and boot that looked like one garment. Oversized blazer with denim mini and cool tuxe with embossed buttons. Lots of frayed trim, how Alber would have like it.

Referring to Elbaz as a “absolute icon” who created couture in a very easy manner, Lutz explained he wanted to “bring the street and rock-n-roll and a little drama to the clothes that should still look precious.”

Huelle worked with Elbaz's “amazing team, and we became friends in two seconds,” determined on making clothes that worked in multiple contexts, and on different ages. He even took a joint bow with six of them.

Diamante crystals in most looks, from power boots and high heels, to posh-punk multi-strand necklaces. And simple but convincing ideas - like a back to front tuxedo shirt dress, with the placket on the back. Alber’s ruffled romanticism riffed on over a dozen looks with huge boss and swirls of fabric.

Though Huelle’s boldest idea were the techno floral camouflage prints, created from sketches and revamped on computers. Seen blurry, on men and women in nylon raincoats, pants, drapes and ruffles; or on country house ball gowns or even saucy cocktails. Only lament, we could have done with more than one version of the print.

All told, perhaps not an epic show, staged on a dank Monday night, but a telling vision of fashion’s future, and one that suggests AZ Factory has legs.Copyright © 2022 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
